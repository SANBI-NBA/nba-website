Their health is fundamental to our national well-being and economic success. An investment in a revised and expanded national river typology will strengthen technical understanding of our diverse river types, facilitating consistent assessment and effective management across the country. A renewed commitment to achieving the Ecological Reserve within our rivers is one of the most important available mechanisms for sustaining the viability of South Africa’s freshwater biodiversity as well as that of estuaries and marine systems dependent on adequate water and sediment replenishment. Upholding the Ecological Reserve is a critical investment in ecological infrastructure that helps buffer people and species from climate change impacts.*\n\n![This distinctive single channel, gravel-dominated stream encompasses a unique set of characteristics and associated support for biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The river line network was used in order to align with the input dataset and results of the Water Research Commision and Department of Water and Sanitation joint project on the updated present ecological state and ecological importance and sensitivity of rivers [@obrien]. Significant progress in earth observation and research partnerships have allowed SANBI and partners to draft a preliminary river area dataset for major rivers across South Africa, as well as a potential riparian ecosystem extent dataset. These, along with associated assessments of their status, will be added to this webpage once they are finalised.\n\nThe diverse rivers of South Africa are shaped by geology, climate, and immense timescales. The Orange-Vaal system rises in the higher rainfall mountains of Lesotho, then flows through increasingly arid country. Its immense age is contrasted by its small contribution to the total national runoff today, demonstrating how river systems can persist through vast climatic changes. Other rivers, like the Berg and the Olifants in the southwest, are also incredibly ancient; their courses are traceable back more than 80 million years and are notable for their clear, cool, and acid 'black' waters. Their long history is evident in the distribution patterns of their aquatic animals, which reflect ancient connections and separations caused by past sea level changes. The remaining perennial rivers are much shorter, especially those along the eastern and southern coasts. These systems have cut down in deep gorges as coastal margins tilted and sea levels dropped in recent geological time. They are subject to enormous hydrological fluctuations. Eastern rivers tend to be warm and turbid (muddy), with neutral to slightly alkaline waters, while south-central and south-western rivers are typically clear and carry cool, acid, 'black' waters. The Pongola and other large rivers in KZN form extensive, fertile floodplains in their lower reaches. Intermittent systems characterise the northern and north-western regions of South Africa. They include seasonally intermittent rivers that cease to flow annually and ephemeral or episodic rivers that flow only after occasional rainfall events with available water reduced to standing pools.\n\n![The rivers of South Africa’s main catchments are visualised broadly according to their river order, with first order (mountain streams) as fine lines, and highest order (lowland rivers) as thick lines. The wide range in river length is evident across the country, from the extensive Orange River and associated tributaries (including the economically important Vaal River), in blue, dominating the central landscape, to the very short coastal rivers, harbouring exceptional biodiversity, along the southern Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coast.

Note this calculation is preliminary, as provinces and projects update the river extent and river area spatial accuracy for South Africa. Numerous projects are underway in this regard.\n\nIn line with the Global Ecosystem Typology, our rivers can be broadly divided into xxx. Consideration of the global typology allows us to leverage the monitoring capabilities of rapidly evolving Earth Observation technology and to report into global processes, including SDG 6.6 and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Emerging freshwater typologies for South Africa integrate river and wetland understanding. We have an interim typology in place and are currently at work on an updated national system to understand and manage our rivers as effectively as possible. The proposed river typology update will contribute significantly towards ensuring their long-term health and the benefits they provide to all South Africans. Work on updated river flow information,\n\n## Approach\n\nRiver ecosystem delineation and the classification system for the 2025 assessment remains largely unchanged from previous national assessments. The river network spatial layer was classified using 31 Level 1 ecoregions, flow variability (permanent or not permanent) and lumped geomorphological zones or slope categories (mountain stream, upper foothill, lower foothill and lowland river) to produce 222 distinct combinations of river ecosystem types[@rowntree2000; @nel2011].\n\nEcoregions broadly characterise the landscape through which a river flows, such that rivers in the same ecoregion share similar broad ecological characteristics (e.g. topography, rainfall and geology).\n\n![The classification of river ecosystem types was described in the 2018 assessment. The combination of the above datasets results and slope categories results in 222 distinct river ecosystem types .](imgs/rivtype_adao.png){#fig-rivtype_adao}\n\nFuture updates propose to include improved landscape classification and validation of the river ecosystem types with species data.\n\n## Technical documentation\n\nDWS.
