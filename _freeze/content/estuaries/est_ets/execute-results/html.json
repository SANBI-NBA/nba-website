Using source view, copy and paste the entire block (the three lines with the pipe | at the start), and edit contents as necessary. Be careful to apply the correct styling parameters (the bits in the sqiggly brackets {}). If you are adding or removing columns, remember to adjust the column widths to add up to 100%.

Concerning overall, more than 70% of estuarine area is significantly modified.\n\nThis represent an overall 1% decline in Natural/Near Natural estuaries & 7% increase in degraded extent. Important ecological processes are under severe pressure and with resultant reductions in ecosystem productivity, food security, fisheries livelihood, property values and recreational enjoyment.\n\nEstuaries requires increase protection and interventions across multiple sectors to arrest ongoing decline. Key concerns are escalating gillnetting pressure, declining water quality, increased flow reduction, and land-use change in the estuarine functional zone (mining & farming).\n\n## Approach\n\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africaâ€™s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.\n\nThe IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:\n\n-   **Criterion A2b** (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.\n\n-   **Criterion A3** (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022\n\n-   **Criterion B3** was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by \\>1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\n-   **Criterion D1** was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\n-   **Criterion D3** was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of \\>= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity \\>=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity \\>=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\nEach of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.\n\nA more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at [RLE explanation page](../integrated-findings/chl_rle_explained.qmd).\n\n## Ecosystem Threat Status Assessment\n\n#REPLACE WITH ANDREW'S ETS MAP\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Benthopelagic and deepsea benthic marine ecosystem type threat status.](imgs/ets_benthic_with_donut.png){#fig-ets_map_benth width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#REPLACE WITH ANDREW'S ETS GRAPHS\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Threat status of marine ecosystem types by functional group.](est_ets_files/figure-html/fig-ets_bargraphs-1.png){#fig-ets_bargraphs width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->\n\n<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->\n\n<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->\n\n<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->\n\n### Code repositories\n\n-   **Threat status assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status)\n\n#ADD ANDREW'S ETS FILE\n\n### Key Publications\n\n## Recommended citation\n\nVan Niekerk, L., Skowno, A.L., Sink, K., & Harris, L.R. 2025.
