The highest priorities are the Critically Endangered Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic which is Not Protected and five ecosystem types that are both Endangered and Not Protected. This includes the Orange Cone Muddy Mid Shelf, Cape Lower Canyon, St Helena Bay, Cape Sheltered Rocky Shore and the KZN Bight Mid Shelf Reef Complex. Three ecosystem types are Critically Endangered and Poorly Protected; the Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf, Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge and Cape Bay. Endangered and poorly protected ecosystem types include some several shore types in the Namaqua, Cape and Agulhas Regions, False and Walker Bay, Western Agulhas Bays, two ecosystem types on the southern KZN shelf and four ecosystem types in the KZN Bight.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ets_epl .cell tbl-cap='NEEDS CAPTION'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](imgs/epl_ets_tbl.png){width=604}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThreatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through MPA expansion or other spatial management measures that could be recognised as Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs). In addition to expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, reduced fishing pressure and improved ecosystem management. Improved bycatch management and diversified measures to protect bathers from sharks using non-lethal measures could help improve ecosystem condition in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nThere is good progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africaâ€™s MPAs (Kirkman et al. 2021, 2023, Mann Lang et al. 2021, Sink et al. 2023), which reveal gaps in participation, cultural heritage protection and governance limiting progress in protection. Sink et al. (2023) share lessons from the 2019 Marine Protected Area expansion which are relevant to future expansion efforts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![NEEDS CAPTION](imgs/epl_ets_with_donut.png){#fig-rle_map width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->\n\n<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->\n\n<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->\n\n<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->\n\n### Code repositories\n\n-   **Protection level assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level)\n\n-   **Threat status assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status)\n\n### Key Publications\n\n## Recommended citation\n\nVan Niekerk, L., Skowno, A.L., Sink, K., & Harris, L.R. 2025.
