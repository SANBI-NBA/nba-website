The contrasting cold Benguela upwelling region and the warm, fast flowing Agulhas current interact with a diverse topography and geological setting to drive exceptional marine biodiversity and high endemism. South Africa is iteratively improving the map of marine ecosystem types as our knowledge of the ocean grows. The latest, 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map contains 163 ecosystem types that nest within 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups in alignment with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET). Progress is underway to leverage rapidly expanding marine data for improved ecosystem mapping.

See the [subantarctic territory page](../subantarctic/sub-all_sections.qmd) for an overview of the marine ecosystem types in the Prince Edward Islands. South Africa’s mainland maritime domain (territorial seas plus exclusive economic zone) extends from the dune base to 200 NM seaward, representing an area of approximately 1.07 million km^2^ and extending to a depth of about 5 500 m. The continental shelf width varies between \\~2 and 260 km, and the shelf break depth ranges between 80 and 600 m, being terraced in places (de Wet and Compton, 2021). The Agulhas Bank is a 116 000-km^2^ triangular extension of the continental shelf that supports many endemic species. Shelf areas constitute approximately 40% of the mainland maritime domain with slope and abyssal ecosystems constituting the remaining 60%. South Africa has a coastline length of over 3 000 km. A separate [coastal chapter](../coast/cst_synthesis.qmd) covers the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n![Overview of South Africa’s 2023 hierarchical marine ecosystem classification with four bathomes (inner ring), 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (central ring), 58 Biogeographic Ecotypes (segments in outer ring) and 163 national Marine Ecosystem Types (not shown as a distinct ring). The number and relative width of each segment in the outer ring reflects the number of national marine ecosystem types nested within each of the Biogeographic Ecotypes. Where there is no number, there is only one ecosystem type associated with that biogeographic ecotype. Note that the shore and shelf do not separate into benthic and pelagic components but the deepsea includes overlapping benthic and pelagic layers. Adapted from Sink et al.

These 163 ecosystem types nest within 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (@fig-sunburst) that align with those of the [IUCN GET](https://global-ecosystems.org/), except for minor differences in terminology and that South Africa included Bays as a distinct group.

2004, South Africa has followed an approach that [iteratively improves the classification and mapping of marine ecosystem types](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1108118)[@sink2023a]. The Marine Ecosystem Map is informed by a broad range of data (@fig-schematic) derived from many types of surveys, including bathymetric, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity research. It is a large collaborative effort and the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map was developed with contributions from 29 authors from 18 different institutions. The map classification follows a nested hierarchy and the 2023 version sought to align with the [IUCN GET structure](https://global-ecosystems.org/page/typology).\n\n<!-- – Luther to make this figure -->\n\n![The range of data that are being used to inform revisions to South Africa’s Marine Ecosystem Map. Increased research and data science investment is improving the marine ecosystem classification and map to support spatial biodiversity assessment and management.](imgs/data_sources_LAdams.png){#fig-schematic}\n\n### Updating the Marine Ecosystem Map {#sec-updatingMEM}\n\nLike its predecessors, the 2023 marine ecosystem map relied heavily on thematic approaches and expert-informed decision-making. Technological advancements are continuously improving our ability to monitor and survey ocean spaces, rapidly increasing the data available to characterise, delineate and understand marine ecosystems. Work is ongoing to update and improve the next version of the Marine Ecosystem Map, which will inform the following National Biodiversity Assessment.\n\nSANBI is implementing data and analytical frameworks to leverage the rapidly escalating volumes of ocean data to improve the Marine Ecosystem Map. This framework consists of a collection of scripted and documented workflows hosted in [online project repositories](https://gitlab.com/marine-map). The scripted workflow components can be updated as new data or better methods become available, can be maintained despite turnover in staff and guiding experts, and are making inroads towards more transparent and reproducible science. This data-driven and reproducible approach has included collation of a suite of environmental gridded data layers and biodiversity survey datasets.\n\nIn regions where sufficient biodiversity data occur, the environmental layers and occurrence records are combined in statistical assemblage distribution models that estimate the co-occurring species assemblages and their preferred habitats, thereby predicting biodiversity patterns and characterising their composition. In regions where insufficient biodiversity data have been collected for the biodiversity analyses, gridded environmental layers are combined in environmental classifications (cluster analyses) to delineate unique habitats (@fig-schematic). The outputs from the assemblage distribution models and the environmental clusters are used as evidence, together with published biogeographic patterns, to consider updates to the ecosystem map. Updates to ecosystem components or types, such as [newly mapped submarine canyons](#box-canyons) and [kelp forests mapped from satellite data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108989) [@dunga2024] are being incorporated in the ecosystem map.\n\n::: {#box-kelps .callout-note .marine collapse=\"False\" appearance=\"minimal\" title=\"Box 1 . Kelp ecosystem types\"}\n<!-- ### South Africa’s submarine canyons -->\n\nLarge brown algae of the order Laminariales fringe rocky shores of temperate and high-latitude regions, creating kelp forest ecosystem types that cover over 30% of shallow rocky reefs globally. They are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and offer many social and economic benefits, including fishing, ecotourism and a variety of kelp-derived products that include animal and human food products, fertilisers, cosmetic and health care products. Evidence of human use of kelp ecosystem species in South Africa has been dated to about 70 000 years ago.\n\n[Dunga et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108989) created the first comprehensive high-resolution map of canopy forming coastal kelp in South Africa, covering the spatial distribution of Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida and Macrocystis pyrifera[@dunga2024]. That work highlighted the need for improved long-term monitoring and a complete national map of kelp distribution.\n\nEmerging and ongoing research is addressing some of these gaps. The IUCN Seaweed Specialist Group will review available data globally by region, while fostering research collaborations. Local projects advancing kelp forest research include an [investigation of marine biodiversity in South African kelp forests](https://www.su.ac.za/en/faculties/medicine/famcru/news/su-and-sea-change-project-join-forces-document-marine-biodiversity-south-african-kelp-forests) and a Masters project to map subsurface kelp forests in South Africa using remotely sensed data, and to assess how they will respond under different climate change scenarios.\n\n <!-- led by [1001 Seaforest Species](https://seachangeproject.com/1001-seaforest-species/) and the [Department of Botany and Zoology at Stellenbosch University](https://www.su.ac.za/en/faculties/science/departments/botany-and-zoology) -->\n \n<!-- ![Masters student, Ms. Nelisiwe Hambile, is embarking on work to map subsurface kelp forests in South Africa using remotely sensed data, and to assess how they will respond under different climate change scenarios.

A suite of oceanographic (physical, chemical and phytoplankton) variables for surface and seafloor depths were downloaded from the [Bio-ORACLE](https://bio-oracle.org/) platform and calculated from [Copernicus Marine Service](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products) satellite products and regional ocean model hindcasts provided by [SAEON](https://www.saeon.ac.za/) and [SOMISANA](https://somisana.ac.za/). Updated sediment data were sourced from collaborators, greatly increasing the inventory of marine sediment sample and seafloor description records. Interpolated maps of sediment characteristics were additionally sourced from [dbSEABED](https://dbseabed.com/). Geomorphological variables included a new, national-scale, 100-m^2^ resolution [bathymetry map](https://doi.org/10.15493/SANBI.220424)[@manikam2024], from which derived variables such as slope angle, bathymetric position index and rugosity were calculated.\n\n::: {#box-canyons .callout-note .marine collapse=\"False\" appearance=\"minimal\" title=\"Box 2. South Africa’s submarine canyons\"}\n<!-- ### South Africa’s submarine canyons -->\n\nSubmarine canyons are steep-sided valleys that cut into the continental slope and play an important role in connecting coastal and deep-sea environments by facilitating the vertical movement of water, sediments, and nutrients. Many of these canyons host complex terrain, diverse substrate types, habitats and species, including vulnerable marine ecosystem indicators, such as cold-water corals and sponges. They act as important nursery and feeding grounds for a variety of benthic and pelagic species, some of which are conservation priorities, such as the African coelacanth, *Latimeria chalumnae*. Furthermore, submarine canyons can act as refuges from anthropogenic pressures, such as trawling, in areas where steep slopes and complex terrain limit human access.\n\nDespite their ecological importance, many of South Africa’s submarine canyons have remained unknown and unmapped due to limited coverage of high-resolution bathymetry data. The release of the 2024 national-scale bathymetric map at 100-m resolution, combined with additional unpublished multibeam echosounder datasets, has enabled a substantial advance in the mapping of submarine canyon features in South Africa, increasing the number of canyon polygons from 39 in 2018 to over 120. This updated canyon map enhances knowledge on canyon classification and geomorphological processes, identifies shelf-breaching canyons that influence shelf ecology, supports habitat predictions for coelacanths and other species, and will improve the delineation of canyon ecosystem types in the next Marine Ecosystem Map.\n\n![South Africa's newly mapped submarine canyons (red outline) overlayed on the new [bathymetry map](https://doi.org/10.15493/SANBI.220424)[@manikam2024].](imgs/canyons_map.png){#fig-canyons}\n:::\n\nSignificant strides were also made in the collation of marine biodiversity records in a biodiversity occurrence database. Data were sourced from online data repositories, such as OBIS and GBIF and requested from a network of collaborators at a variety of government and tertiary research institutions. In October 2025, the database contained 1 310 081 records from 7 726 marine species and 12 data sources, representing a growing collection of biodiversity data in waters around South Africa. Although only a selection of marine survey datasets have been used in assemblage distribution models, the vision is to build a comprehensive biodiversity database that will enable presence-only modelling of biodiversity patterns and species turnover across broad taxonomic groups sourced from many datasets.\n\n::: {#box-ai .callout .marine collapse=\"False\" title=\"Box 3. Artificial intelligence and the Southern Africa Marine Biodiversity Reference Image Collection\"}\n<!-- ### Artificial intelligence and the Southern Africa Marine Biodiversity Reference Image Collection -->\n\nAs underwater imaging technology becomes more accessible and widespread, the volume of visual data from marine surveys has outpaced capacity for manual annotations. This has created a need to improve para-taxonomic capacity and AI-powered solutions that can reliably and efficiently extract species occurrence and count data from underwater biodiversity surveys. In South Africa, [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and [BioCLIP2](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip-2) models have been fine-tuned to identify marine fishes and invertebrates in Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) footage. These models rely on hierarchical taxonomic labels paired with curated images of species. More than 350 benthic invertebrate species across nine phyla have been indexed and catalogued in a standardised [reference image database](https://oneoceanhub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Adams-et-al-2024-OOH-Reference-image-report_Final-submitted.pdf) using the [SMaTaR_ID](https://smartar-id.app/) framework. Pipelines have been developed for automating the detection of vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa in ROV videos, threatened seabreams of commercial importance in BRUVs and benthic epifauna for marine ecosystem classification and mapping. Ongoing work aims to expand the species included in the models through curation of high quality and diverse training datasets that underpin model accuracy.\n:::\n\nThe adoption of reproducible data and analytical pipelines marks a shift in ecosystem mapping methods, one that should improve efficiency, transparency and foster greater understanding and confidence in the resulting ecosystem map, which informs biodiversity management, spatial planning, and conservation efforts in South Africa. Further investment in data science will be needed to curate and integrate rapidly expanding data streams if South Africa is to maintain a robust evidence base to underpin improved ecosystem classification, mapping, assessment, planning, mainstreaming and decision-making.\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n### Code repositories\n\n<!-- -   **Bathymetry map**: [gitlab.com/marine-map/geomorphology/attribute_layers](https://gitlab.com/marine-map/geomorphology/attribute_layers) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Oceanographic variables**: [gitlab.com/marine-map/geomorphology/attribute_layers](https://gitlab.com/marine-map/geomorphology/attribute_layers) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Sediment layers**: [gitlab.com/marine-map/sediment/sediment-map](https://gitlab.com/marine-map/sediment/sediment-map) -->\n\n[Biodiversity occurrence records](https://gitlab.com/marine-map/biodiversity/Occurrence)\n\n<!-- -   **RCP models**: [gitlab.com/marine-map/environmental_clustering](https://gitlab.com/marine-map/environmental_clustering) -->\n\n### Data\n\n[Marine Ecosystem Map](https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2246)\n\n[Table of marine ecosystem types](data/marine_ecotypes.csv)\n\n### Key publications\n\nSink, K.J. et al. 2023.
