Priority actions to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods were co-developed in collaboration with knowledge holders and decision makers. Advancing these priority actions can help to improve the state of marine biodiversity and maintain its many benefits to South Africans.*\n\n![Lighthouse at Cape Agulhas. (© Peter Chadwick)](imgs/lighthouse_cape_agulhas_peter_chadwick.jpg)\n\n## Knowledge progress and gaps\n\nDuring the 2025 assessment of threat status and protection level of marine ecosystems and species, many research gaps that limit the assessment of marine biodiversity emerged. Knowledge gaps identified in the 2018 assessment [@sink2019c] were also revisited and progress against these were briefly evaluated to identify persistent knowledge gaps (Table 1). Persistent knowledge gaps and research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in more equitable marine protection [ecosystem protection level page](marine_epl.qmd).\n\n![Improving the knowledge base to support inclusion of [underwater noise](#box-3) in marine biodiversity assessment and planning is a key research priority with some progress underway. Species groups such as marine mammals are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic underwater noise, affecting life functions. (© Geoff Spiby)](imgs/Marine%20mammals%20are%20sensitive%20to%20underwater%20noise_Geoff%20Spiby.jpg)\n\nSome progress is evident in the research priorities identified in the previous NBA (Table 1). Key areas of progress include foundational biodiversity science for species (Box 1) and [ecosystems](marine_ecosystems.qmd#sec-updatingMEM), research on the impacts of demersal trawling (Atkinson et al. In prep, Rylands 2024), climate change [(Porter, other heatwaves?)]{.mark}, improved understanding of underwater noise (Box 2), and research to support groundtruthing of marine ecological condition [@smit2023; @smit2024; @smit2026].\n\n::: {#box-1 .callout-note .marine title=\"Box 1. Progress in foundational marine biodiversity science.\" collapse=\"false\"}\n<!-- Box 1: Progress in foundational marine biodiversity science   -->\n\n![Citizen scientists have advanced the taxonomy and distribution records for nudibranchs and produced a beautiful publication that makes this information accessible. (© Georgina Jones)](imgs/nudibranch_georgina_jones.jpg)\n\nProgress in taxonomic knowledge include the description of 868 species of sea slugs known to the southern African region and the publication of a field guide outlining their distribution and engaging illustrations to enable easy identification in the field (Gosliner et al. 2024).\n\nTaxonomic descriptions of 170 southern African sea cucumbers species were published, representing 55 years of research, and calling for increased efforts to further build taxonomic capacity in southern Africa (Thandar 2022). The state of knowledge of South African azooxanthellate coral species has been improved, with the total number of known species increased from 77 to 108, with 28 new species records, three new species and one new genus (Filander et al 2021).\n:::\n\nLittle progress has been made on redlisting of marine species and no progress has been made in terms of evaluating species protection levels in the marine realm although research to evaluate potential increases in protection level of the African penguin is underway. Progress has been made in developing standardised monitoring approaches for early detection of marine invasive alien species (Loureiro et al 2021) but gaps remain in establishing rapid response mechanisms once species are detected.\n\n## Knowledge gaps limiting species and ecosystem assessment\n\nOngoing challenges in assessing marine species, genetic biodiversity and ecosystems include the crises in taxonomy and a poor understanding of species distribution data (Table 1). Innovative and integrated methods that can help address these gaps include imaging approaches, molecular methods, digital taxonomy, active and passive acoustics, citizen science and the strategic connection of biodiversity databases (Rogers et al, 2022). Progress in these complementary areas can increase our understanding of species distribution and feed into improved marine biodiversity assessment at all levels (genetic, species and ecosystems) and multiple scales. Foundational data gaps and capacity constraints limit the IUCN Red List assessment (extinction risk) of marine species. Although dedicated marine species red listing support has been recognised as a key need since 2008 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11 prev NBA), there has been no progress in securing resources or capacity to advance this work (Subramoney et al. 2024).\n\nSouth Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected. A national genetics monitoring framework is still lacking and the integration of genetic/genomic data into marine spatial plans.\n\nChallenges in measuring ecosystem condition and developing agreed thresholds of collapse for different ecosystem functional groups include capacity gaps, data and monitoring gaps and conceptual challenges with the need to apply a greater diversity of indicators to this end.\n\nGroundtruthing ecosystem types remains crucial for ongoing improvement of their descriptions and delineations. For example, the marine realm uses techniques such as remote operated vehicle surveys and seabed sampling (e.g. by grab samples, research trawls and sleds) to collect information on biotic components of ecosystem types; while abiotic data like bathymetry, water turbidity, productivity data and sediments also contribute to ecosystem classification. Progress in work to strengthen the classification and delineation of marine ecosystem types is detailed on the Marine Ecosystem types page.\n\nA comprehensive list of research priorities that could advance the assessment of South Africa’s biodiversity can be found here: XXX [Megan wants to Lets make a clear list for download.

More than 80 individual actions were co-developed and classified into ten broad thematic areas with more detailed recommended steps and potential indicators of progress for each action. These are not comprehensive, prescriptive or time bound but include specific and measurable elements, where possible, to more easily track progress. Each of the 10 actions were linked to relevant Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets (box 3) to easily inform ongoing policy processes. The marine assessment team will evaluate progress for these recommended steps in future assessments.\n\n:::::: {#box-3 .callout-note .marine title=\"Box 3.

The framework has four goals and 23 targets for protecting, conserving and restoring biodiversity. South Africa is in the process of domesticating the GBF targets and aligning its national strategies to achieve these ambitious targets. Whilst aimed at improving biodiversity, the framework elevates the importance of indigenous, peoples and local communities, and seeks to enhance the role this important stakeholder group plays in protecting and managing biodiversity now and in further.

The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework [@unitednations2014] was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.\n\nNatural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy [@costanza2011; @costanza1997; @stebbings2021].\n\nThrough the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.\n:::\n\n<!-- ![TBA](imgs/PA_9.png) -->\n::::\n\n<!-- ######################################################### -->\n\n::: {.callout .freshwater collapse=\"false\"}\n## 10.

Citizen science is also supporting taxonomic research (<a href=\"#box-1\">Nudiranchs</a>) although potential records far exceed taxonomic capacity and reference collections need investment to make the most of this approach. A  reference image database [@adams2024] is being advanced and there is a need to invest in digital taxonomy [@rogers2023]. Progress in the application of machine learning in processing of seabed imagery is limited by taxonomic constraints with a need to undertake reference collections with in situ images and barcodes linked to taxonomic samples. Further systematic prioritization of invertebrate groups together with filling taxonomic knowledge gaps could improve our ability to conduct more Red List  assessments for marine invertebrates [@subramoney2024].</span></span></td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n  \n</table>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Approach\n\n### Priority actions\n\nDrawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 70 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 70 priority actions, a set of 10 key overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended sub-actions which if implemented could make marine biodiversity better in the water. Drawing from the more specific recommended actions, specific and measurable indicators of progress per action were co-developed.\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->\n\n<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->\n\n<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->\n\n<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->\n\n### Code repositories\n\n<!-- -   **Threat status assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Protection level assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Marine Ecosystem Map**: [BGIS](https://bgis.sanbi.org/SpatialDataset/Detail/7749) -->\n\n### Data\n\n### Key publications\n\nRylands S, Sink KJ, van der Bank MG, Dunga LV, Bull L, Hambile N, Shibe S. 2025.
