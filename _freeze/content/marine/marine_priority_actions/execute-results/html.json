Priority actions to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods were co-developed in collaboration with knowledge holders and decision makers. Advancing these priority actions can help to improve the state of marine biodiversity and maintain its many benefits to South Africans.*\n\n![Lighthouse at Cape Agulhas. © Peter Chadwick.](imgs/lighthouse_cape_agulhas_peter_chadwick.jpg)\n\n## Knowledge progress and gaps\n\nDuring the assessment of threat status and protection level of marine ecosystems and species, many research gaps emerged that limit the assessment of marine biodiversity. The [2018 assessment](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12143/6372) also identified knowledge gaps and progress against these research priorities [@sink2019a] [was briefly evaluated (Table / Box x)]{.mark}. Persistent research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in equitable protection (Ecosystem protection level).\n\n![Citizen scientists have advanced the taxonomy and distribution records for nudibranchs and produced a beautiful publication that makes this information accessible. © Georgina Jones](imgs/nudibranch_georgina_jones.jpg)\n\n## Priority actions\n\nDrawing from the key findings of this assessment, a number of priority actions were co-developed to improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). More than 70 individual actions were co-developed and these were classified into ten broad thematic areas of action with more detailed recommended steps and indicators for each action in order to track progress.\n\n::: {#box-1 .callout-note .freshwater collapse=\"false\"}\n## 1.

The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework (United Nations et al., 2014) was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.\n\nNatural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy (Costanza et al., 1997, 2011; Stebbings et al., 2021).\n\nThrough the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.\n:::\n\n<!-- ![TBA](imgs/PA_9.png) -->\n::::\n\n<!-- ######################################################### -->\n\n::: {#box-10 .callout .freshwater collapse=\"false\"}\n## 10.

Citizen science is also supporting taxonomic research (<a href=\"#box-1\">Nudiranchs</a>) although potential records far exceed taxonomic capacity and reference collections need investment to make the most of this approach. A  reference image database [@adams2024] is being advanced and there is a need to invest in digital taxonomy [@rogers2023]. Progress in the application of machine learning in processing of seabed imagery is limited by taxonomic constraints with a need to undertake reference collections with in situ images and barcodes linked to taxonomic samples. Further systematic prioritization of invertebrate groups together with filling taxonomic knowledge gaps could improve our ability to conduct more Red List  assessments for marine invertebrates [@subramoney2024].</span></span></td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n  \n</table>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Approach\n\n### Priority actions\n\nDrawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 70 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 70 priority actions, a set of 10 key overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended sub-actions which if implemented could make marine biodiversity better in the water. Drawing from the more specific recommended actions, specific and measurable indicators of progress per action were co-developed.\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->\n\n<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->\n\n<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->\n\n<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->\n\n### Code repositories\n\n<!-- -   **Threat status assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Protection level assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Marine Ecosystem Map**: [BGIS](https://bgis.sanbi.org/SpatialDataset/Detail/7749) -->\n\n### Data\n\n### Key publications\n\nRylands S, Sink KJ, van der Bank MG, Dunga LV, Bull L, Hambile N, Shibe S. 2025.
