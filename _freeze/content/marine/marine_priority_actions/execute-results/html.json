Priority actions to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods were co-developed in collaboration with knowledge holders and decision makers. Advancing these priority actions can help to improve the state of marine biodiversity and maintain its many benefits to South Africans.*\n\n![Lighthouse at Cape Agulhas.

Knowledge gaps identified in the 2018 assessment [@sink2019c] were also revisited and progress against these were briefly evaluated to identify persistent knowledge gaps.\n\nPersistent knowledge gaps and research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in more equitable marine protection ([ecosystem protection level page](../marine/marine_epl.qmd)).\n\n![Improving the knowledge base to support inclusion of [underwater noise](#box-3) in marine biodiversity assessment and planning is a key research priority with some progress underway. Species groups such as marine mammals are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic underwater noise, affecting life functions. (© Geoff Spiby)](imgs/Marine_mammals_are_sensitive_to_underwater_noise_Geoff_Spiby.png)\n\n### Foundational biodiversity research\n\nKey areas of progress in foundational biodiversity research for species ([Box 1](#box-1)) and [ecosystems](../marine/marine_ecosystems.qmd#sec-updatingMEM), include progress in taxonomic knowledge of species and new and improved species distribution knowledge for informing a more data-driven national marine ecosystem map. Gaps remain in systematic genetic barcoding and analyses linked to analyses of seabed and fish fauna imagery and mapping of marine ecosystems and species. Innovative artificial intelligence methodologies can assist in processing large datasets, unlocking these for inclusion in analyses that improve the national marine ecosystem map.\n\nSouth Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected\n\n<!-- Some progress is evident in the research priorities identified in the previous NBA (Table 1). Key areas of progress include foundational biodiversity science for species , research on the impacts of demersal trawling (Atkinson et al. In prep, Rylands 2024), climate change [(Porter, other heatwaves?)]{.mark}, improved understanding of underwater noise ([Box 2](marine_pressures.qmd#box-2)), and research to support groundtruthing of marine ecological condition [@smit2023; @smit2024; @smit2026]. -->\n\n:::::::::::: {#box-1 .callout-note .marine title=\"Box 1.

The most recent previous publication for this group was Nudibranchs of Southern Africa, which was published in 1987, covered 268 species. By 2023, a further 600 species had been observed with scuba divers playing a major role in documenting new records. The sheer range and diversity of species included in the guide are a testament to the astonishing biodiversity of the region and also to the diverse community of scientists, photographers, artists and citizen scientists who worked together to create the book. Thousands of field observations were collated to give the most accurate picture of species' size, geographical and depth ranges and life histories known to date.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"2%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n![A new field guide for nudibranchs covers 868 species.

South Africa’s Marine Taxonomy Working group identified several national priorities to address the critical shortfall in marine taxonomic research and capacity.\n\n::: {#box-rp1 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\" title=\"A number of specific research priorities to strengthen foundational biodiversity knowledge for the marine realm have been identified. \n\\\n[Read more »]()\"}\n\n-   Research to validate and improve South Africa’s evolving national map of marine ecosystem types. Research effort beyond the shelf including slope, plateau, seamount and abyssal systems is particularly encouraged with a need to test the extent of differences between deep-sea ecosystem types in the Indian, Atlantic and Southern oceans. (foundation).\n\n-   Integrated taxonomic research with a focus on validating species identification with in-situ imagery and genetic barcodes. This will enable increased application of increasing imagery to support foundational ecosystem research and monitoring. (foundation)….\n\n-   Research that aAdvances the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analytics for the analysis of big data and in support of the national marine ecosystem map.\n\n-   Research to identify key drivers of marine biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes from under researched geographic areas.\n:::\n\nLittle progress has been made on IUCN redlisting of marine species and no progress has been made in terms of evaluating species protection levels in the marine realm although research to evaluate potential increases in protection level of the African penguin is underway. Research is needed to comprehensively assess species taxon groups using the IUCN Red List criteria and improve current knowledge on the state of South Africa’s marine species.\n\nProgress has been made in developing standardised monitoring approaches for early detection of marine invasive alien species [@loureiro2021] but gaps remain in establishing rapid response mechanisms once species are detected.\n\n\nRecommendations to strengthen taxonomic research in South Africa as identified by the marine taxonomy working group.  Accurate taxonomy published in the peer reviewed literature can support global recognition for South Africa’s exceptional marine biodiversity.\n\n\n::: {#box-2 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\" title=\"Box 2. Recommendations to strengthen taxonomic research in South Africa as identified by the marine taxonomy working group. Accurate taxonomy published in the peer reviewed literature can support global recognition for South Africa’s exceptional marine biodiversity.  \n\\\n[Read more »]()\"}\n\n-   Ensure taxonomic data is effectively collated, coordinated and managed through effective data management, integrated and accessible platforms that prioritise taxonomic data and by employing and developing well trained, permanent, networked data managers /systems administrators across institutions. \n\n-   Communicate the value of taxonomic research, collections and collection management to mobilise increased and resources and capacity to address foundational marine biodiversity knowledge. Collections must be recognised as critical national assets that underpin biodiversity management. \n\n-   Improve the accuracy of taxonomic components of biodiversity research, environmental impact assessment and natural resource management studies by facilitating, funding and promoting the involvement of taxonomists in such efforts and ensuring that the cost of their contribution is budgeted for in publicly funded projects (e.g. in port surveys,  environmental impact studies and statements, fishery management assessments, etc.). Collection and lodgement of voucher specimens from such projects also requires funding support. \n\n-   Increase job opportunities, research funding and provide direction for taxonomic centres to continue to describe, inventory and assess the marine biota of South Africa. Key taxonomic priorities include cnidarians, sponges, bryozoans, polychaetes, crustaceans, ascidians and elasmobranchs. These priorities were based on available expertise, extent of endemism, economic importance, components of sensitive seabed habitats, invasive potential, indicators of global change and critical knowledge gaps identified during this assessment. \n\n-   Encourage and support efforts to enhance the development of modern taxonomic keys, digital and other guides, and other accessible taxonomic outreach products. \n\n-   Enlist the support of the Department of Science and Innovation and Universities to promote the inclusion of taxonomy in undergraduate curricula and the teaching of taxonomy by appropriately trained educators.  \n\n-   Establish targeted PhD scholarships for students of taxonomy and mentoring programs to support early-career researchers to train with local and international taxonomists.  \n\n-   Support increased research, training and funding for the development of molecular genetic techniques in the taxonomy of marine organisms – including post-graduate training and developing incentives to partner with industry. South Africa must make further progress in integrated taxonomy. \n\n-   Help organisations that use taxonomic outputs but do not themselves employ taxonomists to support these priorities.

Innovative and integrated methods that can help address these gaps include imaging approaches, molecular methods, digital taxonomy, active and passive acoustics, citizen science and the strategic connection of biodiversity databases (Rogers et al, 2022). Progress in these complementary areas can increase our understanding of species distribution and feed into improved marine biodiversity assessment at all levels (genetic, species and ecosystems) and multiple scales. Foundational data gaps and capacity constraints limit the IUCN Red List assessment (extinction risk) of marine species. Although dedicated marine species red listing support has been recognised as a key need since 2008 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11 prev NBA), there has been no progress in securing resources or capacity to advance this work (Subramoney et al. 2024).\n\nSouth Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected. A national genetics monitoring framework is still lacking and the integration of genetic/genomic data into marine spatial plans.\n\nChallenges in measuring ecosystem condition and developing agreed thresholds of collapse for different ecosystem functional groups include capacity gaps, data and monitoring gaps and conceptual challenges with the need to apply a greater diversity of indicators to this end.\n\nGroundtruthing ecosystem types remains crucial for ongoing improvement of their descriptions and delineations. For example, the marine realm uses techniques such as remote operated vehicle surveys and seabed sampling (e.g. by grab samples, research trawls and sleds) to collect information on biotic components of ecosystem types; while abiotic data like bathymetry, water turbidity, productivity data and sediments also contribute to ecosystem classification. Progress in work to strengthen the classification and delineation of marine ecosystem types is detailed on the [Marine Ecosystem types page](../marine/marine_ecosystems.qmd).\n\nA comprehensive list of research priorities that could advance the assessment of South Africa’s biodiversity can be found here: XXX [Megan wants to Lets make a clear list for download. Something that funders can put forward in calls]{.mark}\n\n## Priority actions for improving the state of marine biodiversity\n\nDrawing from the key findings of NBA 2025, several priority actions were co-developed to improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). More than 80 individual actions were co-developed and classified into ten broad thematic areas with more detailed recommended steps and potential indicators of progress for each action. These are not comprehensive, prescriptive or time bound but include specific and measurable elements, where possible, to more easily track progress. Each of the 10 actions were linked to relevant Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets ([Box 3](#box-3)) to easily inform ongoing policy processes. The marine assessment team will evaluate progress for these recommended steps in future assessments.\n\n:::::::: {#box-3 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"false\" title=\"Box 3.

An important feature of South Africa’s biodiversity-related action to the pressures on biodiversity has been spatial planning to identify priority areas in the seascape for intervention. The NBA provides an initial portfolio of spatial priorities by highlighting the location of the most threatened ecosystems and species and by intersecting the results of ecosystem threat status and protection level. However, it is not only threatened biodiversity that needs attention; often there are strategic gains to be made from focusing on areas that are still in good ecological condition and where there are relatively easy opportunities for protection or effective management.\n\n## Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs)\n\nSANBI, in collaboration with its partners, is responsible for the identification of Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) across all realms (von Staden et al. 2022). CBA mapping is achieved through the application of systematic conservation planning to identify areas that are in a natural/near-natural state that represent opportunities where biodiversity management action can be most impactful. CBA Maps are the biodiversity sector’s input into decisions on appropriate land and sea uses to safeguard a sufficient, representative sample of biodiversity that can persist into the future, in support of sustainable economic development and to meet international environmental commitments. Spatial biodiversity priority areas [(link to CBA map)]{.mark} to protect, restore and recover marine ecosystems and species have been identified, and are being improved with increased stakeholder dialogue, collaboration, and technical innovation.\n\n## Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSA)\n\nIn the marine realm, South Africa also has a network of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) that were adopted by the CBD in 2014 at the 12th Convention of Parties. Initially, EBSAs were conceptualised to be a tool by which MPAs might be identified and established in the high seas; however, their value within national jurisdiction, and for helping countries to achieve their Aichi targets, soon became apparent. Through a series of regional workshops, EBSAs were identified by evaluating sites against seven criteria, and were delineated within country Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), in the high seas, and in transboundary (country-country, or country-high seas) areas.\n\n## Approach\n\n### Knowledge gaps\n\nKnowledge gaps and research priorities were identified throughout the NBA 2025, but also through a systematic review of progress against research priorities identified in the NBA 2018.\n\n<!-- # ```{r} -->\n\n<!-- #| label: tbl-48 -->\n\n<!-- #| echo: false -->\n\n<!-- #| tbl-cap: Summary of progress made in addressing knowledge gaps identified in NBA 2018.   -->\n\n<!-- #| out-width: 100% -->\n\n<!-- #| classes: plain -->\n\n<!-- library(tidyverse) -->\n\n<!-- # load the data  -->\n\n<!-- tbl_48 <- read.csv(file=list.files(pattern = \"^Table_48update.csv$\", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE),  -->\n\n<!--                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE) -->\n\n<!-- library(gt) -->\n\n<!-- tbl <- tbl_48 %>% -->\n\n<!--   mutate(across( -->\n\n<!--     everything(), -->\n\n<!--     ~ { -->\n\n<!--       x <- as.character(.) -->\n\n<!--       x <- iconv(x, from = \"\", to = \"UTF-8\", sub = \"\")   # fix encoding first -->\n\n<!--       x <- gsub(\"\\u00a0\", \" \", x, fixed = TRUE)          # replace non-breaking spaces -->\n\n<!--       x -->\n\n<!--     } -->\n\n<!--   )) -->\n\n<!--   gt::gt(tbl)%>% -->\n\n<!--   fmt_markdown(columns = everything())  %>% -->\n\n<!--   nbaR::nba_tbl_theme(HEADER = \"Marine\") %>%  -->\n\n<!--   tab_style( -->\n\n<!--     style = cell_text(color = \"white\"), -->\n\n<!--     locations = cells_column_labels() -->\n\n<!--   ) -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n### Priority actions\n\nDrawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 80 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 80 specific actions, a set of 10 overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended indicators of progress that point to a range of sub-actions which if implemented could improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa.\n\n### Priority areas\n\nSouth Africa has several established spatial prioritisation tools for informing the work of the biodiversity sector. Principle among these are\n\n(1) the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy (NPAES),\n\n(2) Spatial biodiversity plans, which provide maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), together called Critical Biodiversity Area or CBA Maps.\n\n(3) Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs)\n\nTogether these tools provide a comprehensive set of biodiversity priority areas that collectively meet biodiversity targets for ecosystems, species and ecological processes. Increasingly, critical ecological infrastructure assets are also included in this set of biodiversity priority areas. Maps of biodiversity priority areas directly support the implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP).\n\nMaps of CBAs and ESAs, referred to as CBA maps, are produced by all provincial conservation authorities, marine planners and some metropolitan municipalities and are based on the principles of systematic biodiversity planning. They are a form of strategic planning for the natural environment, identifying a set of geographic areas that provide a spatial plan for ecological sustainability at the landscape and seascape scale. A CBA Map comprises five map categories: Protected Areas (PAs), Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs), Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), Other Natural Areas (ONAs) and areas where there is No Natural habitat Remaining (NNR). Guidelines published by SANBI (SANBI 2017) encourage consistency between the CBAs prepared by different agencies.\n\nProtected areas, CBAs and ESAs together form a network of natural and semi-natural areas that enable ecologically functional seascapes and landscapes in the long term, designed to be spatially efficient and to avoid conflict with non-compatible land and ocean uses wherever possible. CBAs should be kept in a natural or near natural state to support ecological sustainability of the landscape and seascape. ESAs do not need to be entirely natural, but should be kept at least semi-natural so that they retain their ecological processes. These natural and semi-natural areas can co-exist in a matrix of multiple uses, including fisheries, aquaculture, mining, ports and others.\n\nLand-based CBA Maps have been produced for over a decade, while the first map of CBAs and ESAs for the coast and ocean was completed in 2019 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11). Since 2019, data collation and analyses have improved with the last published version of the CBA map produced in 2022 [(check)]{.mark}.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSincere thanks to the more than 123 individuals who actively participated in the three engagements held to co-develop priority actions for improved Ecosystem Based Management in South Africa.
