This will enable better understanding of the value of marine biodiversity and its contribution to the economy.\n\n-   A new product is co-developed to make the case for the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries.\n\n-   Communication efforts are underway to reduce the risk of marine invasives.\n\n-   Marine needs identified and communicated to Statistics South Africa to support data collection for new statistics that support effective communication of the value of marine biodiversity to the economy.\n\n-   First set of marine and coastal natural capital accounts published.\n\n::: {#box .callout .box-within-box collapse=\"false\"}\n## Explainer: Natural capital accounting\n\nEconomic growth is intrinsically linked to environmental benefits, and studies have shown that environmental degradation can have far reaching implications for economic activity and human health (Acheampong & Opoku, 2023). The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework (United Nations et al., 2014) was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.\n\nNatural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy (Costanza et al., 1997, 2011; Stebbings et al., 2021).\n\nThrough the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.\n:::\n\n<!-- ![TBA](imgs/PA_9.png){.lightbox} -->\n::::\n\n<!-- ######################################################### -->\n\n::: {#box-10 .callout .marine collapse=\"false\"}\n## 10.

To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 70 priority actions, a set of 10 key overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended sub-actions which if implemented could make marine biodiversity better in the water. Drawing from the more specific recommended actions, specific and measurable indicators of progress per action were co-developed.\n\n## Technical documentation\n\n<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->\n\n<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->\n\n<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->\n\n<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->\n\n### Code repositories\n\n<!-- -   **Threat status assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/threat_status) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Protection level assessment**: [gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/ecosystem_assessment/protection_level) -->\n\n<!-- -   **Marine Ecosystem Map**: [BGIS](https://bgis.sanbi.org/SpatialDataset/Detail/7749) -->\n\n### Data\n\n### Key publications\n\nRylands S, Sink KJ, van der Bank MG, Dunga LV, Bull L, Hambile N, Shibe S. 2025.
