Fishing, particularly widespread industrial fishing, continues to exert substantial pressures on marine biodiversity, affecting ecosystems, species and genetic diversity. Mining, petroleum, flow reduction, port and harbour development and shipping also drive ecosystem modification and risk to marine species with increasing pollution (plastics, underwater noise, waste water and effluent )and climate change concerns. Pressure mapping needs to be updated and improved for more accurate assessments and planning, especially at finer scales.*\n\n![Coastal mining between Kleinzee and Lambertsbaai.

Fishing, particularly industrial fishing, continues to exert the greatest pressures on marine biodiversity (link to KMA5) impacting ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (link to KMB3).** -->\n\n## Cumulative Pressures\n\nSouth Africa uses cumulative pressure mapping as a key input into the assessment of marine ecosystem threat status. A total of 31 pressures have been mapped to support biodiversity assessment and spatial planning [@majiedt2019]. These include historical pressures that may have ceased in some areas but have contributed to long-term changes in ecological condition. Both the number and intensity of pressures is considered in cumulative pressure mapping.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa's ocean. Red and orange areas have the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures.](imgs/cum_press_low_res.png){#fig-cum-press width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAreas with high cumulative pressures include most bays, the area offshore of the Orange River, the shelf edge off the west and south coasts, large portions of the Cape inner and middle shelf, the Agulhas Bank and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. The highest cumulative pressure in the marine realm was recorded in Saldanha Bay.\n\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which alter shorelines and circulation, increase urbanisation and access for fishers, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. New ports and harbours can have substantial impacts on marine biodiversity and livelihoods and therefore warrant careful evaluation in spatial planning and decision-making.\n\nSkein et al. (2022) examined 17 key pressures from 17 different sectors and their links to 23 key ecosystem characteristics (@fig-cum-press) that have implications for ecosystem services. Fishing, petroleum (referred to as “Non-renewable (oil and gas)” in @fig-cum-press) and shipping had the most widespread effects across the most ecosystem components, accounting for 30% of total linkage pathways identified, with fishing showing the most linkages overall. This is due to the extensive and complex nature of these three sectors, each of which comprise various components that may impact marine life in different ways. For example, offshore oil and gas sector activities include exploration (invasive and non-invasive), production and transport, each exerting different pressures on marine biodiversity. Anticipated [renewable energy](#renewable-energy) installations will have implications for marine ecosystems and species in future, through increased underwater noise, habitat modification and wildlife collisions, depending on the energy source.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![South African marine ecosystem risk assessment Sankey diagram illustrating links among sectors (left), their associated pressures (middle) and the ecological components (right) that are impacted by these pressures. The width of the lines represent the Impact Risk (describing the exposure and severity of an interaction). Sectors, pressures and ecological components appear in descending order based on sum Impact Risk scores ([Skein et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.975328/full)).](imgs/pressure_impact.png){#fig-risk-ass width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPervasive pressures with multiple drivers ([Cross-cutting pressures](#Cross-cutting-pressures)) include pollution emanating from industrial, municipal and agricultural sources, ocean noise associated with activities such as shipping, mining and petroleum exploration, light pollution from artificial light at night especially in coastal areas, and invasive alien species.\n\nClimate change and ocean acidification, primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, cause diverse and interrelated pressures that impact marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. Furthermore, by creating stressful environmental conditions (e.g. altered temperatures or reduced oxygen levels), climate change and ocean acidification increase the vulnerability of marine life to other pressures such as pollution or the impacts of fishing.\n\nThe indirect and cumulative impacts of expanding ocean activities need more attention in marine environmental management. Failure to account for potential cumulative and indirect impacts will preclude such impacts from being taken into account in spatial planning and decision-making, with likely negative implications for people and the environment.\n\n## Sector and pressure overviews\n\nPressure data sets are important inputs into spatial assessments and planning. Marine pressure data for South Africa is described in the 2018 NBA marine technical report [@majiedt2019] that explained and mapped each pressure, summarised patterns in their extent and intensity, and reviewed their known biodiversity impacts, noting any known mitigation measures or relevant work that was underway. Drawing on the above and information that is available in more recent National Data and Information Report for Marine Spatial Planning [@departmentofforestryfisheriesandtheenvironment2020], a brief summary of sectors and pressures is provided below (only references not previously cited in Majiedt et al. (2019) are indicated).\n\nIn general, updating and improvement of pressure data sets are required. Outdated pressure maps, pressure data that are missing or of a poor resolution, and inaccurate estimation of pressure impacts on ecological condition, all reduce the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and the efficacy of spatial planning. For example, missing pressure data in certain areas or for certain sub-sectors (such as small-scale fishing) omits key rightsholders and compromises integrated and equitable spatial planning. Long-term pressure data series are needed for ecosystem and species assessment ([key message B5](../key-messages/kmb5.qmd)) and finer scale mapping for more accurate assessment of ecological condition.\n\n### Fishing\n\n![South African fisheries provide food, employment and revenue and are making progress in addressing impacts on marine biodiversity. (© Peter Chadwick, African Conservation Photographer)](imgs/045_Fisheries_©PeterChadwick_AfricanConservationPhotographer.png)\n\n::: {#box1 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Fishing incorporates at least 19 South African fishing sectors representing industrial, commercial, small-scale, artisanal and recreational fisheries, with a variety of methods employed to target a wide range of fish, invertebrate and seaweed resources.\n\n\\\nFishing methods include trawling (demersal and mid-water), longlining (demersal and pelagic), purse-seining, linefishing, squid jigging, trap fishing, hand harvesting, beach seining, and wet and dry kelp harvesting.\n\nMore than 700 marine species are directly affected by fishing in South Africa [@vanderbank2019], with bycatch a key concern for trawl and longline fisheries. There have been improvements in managing incidental mortalities of seabirds, but bycatch of sharks, skates and rays is a driver of the threatened status of this group (see [shark species page](../species/sp_sharks.qmd)) with work underway to support improved management [@departmentofforestryfisheriesandtheenvironment2022]. More information on fisheries impacts on stock status or species threat status is reported in the [species page for the marine realm](../species/marine_sp.qmd).\n\nFisheries affect benthic and pelagic ecosystems through multiple pathways of impact [@skein2022], with the impact of the demersal trawl and longline fisheries on seabed habitats providing a straightforward example (@fig-risk-ass). Measures have been taken to manage the ecosystem impacts of trawl fishing through freezing the demersal hake trawl footprint, new co-developed spatial management measures and work to identify and protect Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems [@franken2025] [(Sink et al. 2025 - the trawl report)]{.mark}.\n\nUnsustainable fishing includes overfishing of target or bycatch species and fishing practices that can have severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Overfishing can include unsustainable total numbers of fish being caught and overharvesting of specific size or age classes that are critical for maintaining population growth and fishery sustainability. Some fishing gear types are known to incidentally catch high numbers of non-target species (bycatch or incidental mortalities) and/or to impact seabed habitats. Illegal fishing and ghost fishing from lost fishing gear are difficult to map and qualify, but these unsustainable fishing practices can have negative impacts on the food web (trophic effects) and lead to ecosystem degradation.\n\nAlthough industrial fisheries generally have greater and more widespread impacts on marine ecosystems and species, all fisheries sectors contribute to fishing pressures in the marine realm. In terms of participation, the recreational fishery is the largest of all the fishing sectors in South Africa (460-550 000 fishers [@potts2022]). This and the high technical capacity [@viana2025] of mobile recreational fishers dispersed along the entire coast means that this sector has a significant impact on fisheries resources. Furthermore, the recreational fishery is currently ineffectively governed by inadequate policy and regulations and remains largely unmonitored and poorly enforced [@potts2020], with high levels of non-compliance (\\~50% [@bova2022]) and poor environmental behaviours being the norm in many recreational fisher communities [@kramer2017; @farthing2025]. While some commercial linefish species have demonstrated recent recovery, many species, also targeted by the recreational fishery, remain overexploited [@departmentofforestryfisheriesandtheenvironment2025a], especially kobs (see [species summary page](../species/marine_sp.qmd)) and some seabreams (see [seabream page](../species/sp_sparids.qmd).\n\nThere is evidence of some pro-active, conscientious recreational fishers adopting voluntary catch-and-release and other best practices in a growing social movement of self-reform [@mannheim2018; @allison2023]. However, while there is growing acceptance of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) practice as an essential practice, there is a growing consensus that poor release practices can still contribute considerably to fishing mortality [@butler2017; @mann2018]. Potential indicators of progress in the reform of recreational fisheries have been identified [Action 5](marine_priority_actions.qmd) of SANBI's priority actions.\n\nOverfishing can also impact genetic biodiversity of fishery species by reducing diversity and effective population size, compromising their resilience and ability to adapt [@dasilva2019]. A recent study highlighted the long-term evolutionary costs of overfishing of the seventy-four seabream (*Polysteganus undulosus*) which has suffered drastic decline in genetic diversity and effective population size [@oosthuizen2024]. Recent genomic studies on kingklip (*Genypterus capensis*) revealed three genetically distinct populations across southern African waters, with signs of local adaptation [@schulze2020], highlighting the need for sustainable, spatially specific, transboundary management. Similarly, the two African hake species (*Merluccius* spp.) both show low genome-wide diversity. Shallow-water hake (*M. capensis*) shows three structured populations across the Benguela Current region, while deep-water hake (*M. paradoxus*), previously considered panmictic, now shows a split between the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean populations [@forde2025]. Managing species with spatially distinct sub-populations as single stocks may further exacerbate their low genomic diversity.\n\nBuilding on previous successes, fisheries management can support resource, species and ecosystem recovery (key message [A5](../key-messages/kma5.qmd) and [B1](../key-messages/kmb1.qmd)). Strengthened ecosystem-based fisheries management can be achieved through reviews and updates to ecological risk assessments, development and implementation of effective fisheries management plans, improved bycatch monitoring and management, increased biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries, improved societal and user participation in fisheries regulation and decision making and strengthened collaboration among ocean institutions (Priority actions [5](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-8), [1](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-4), [2](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-5), [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6) [6](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-9), [7](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-10), [8](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-11), [9](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-12), and [10](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-13)).\n:::\n\n### Lethal shark control\n\n::: {#box2 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## South Africa has employed lethal shark control measures in the province of KwaZulu-Natal since 1952 to protect bathers from the risk of shark bites.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nThese measures, comprising gill nets and baited hooks (drum lines), are implemented to reduce the population of sharks in the vicinity of certain beaches, thereby reducing the probability of an ocean user encountering a shark. These measures are implemented between Richards Bay and Port Edward with 13.5 km of nets and 177 baited drumlines deployed in summer and 0.2 km of nets and 270 baited drumlines in winter (see [Improvements in shark control measures](#box3)). Biodiversity concerns associated with the shark control program include the overexploited and threatened status of several target and bycatch species of cartilaginous fishes (see [shark, rays, and chimeras species page](../species/sp_sharks.qmd)), catches of turtles and marine mammal species (see [species summary page](../species/marine_sp.qmd#box-2)) and potential ecosystem effects linked to the removal of predatory sharks. Of the 14 species of large sharks regularly caught by the KwaZulu-Natal sharks board, 11 are threatened. All of the affected marine mammal and turtle species are listed as Threatened or Protected species under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act.\n\nLethal shark control measures add to the pressure on elasmobranchs from other fisheries, particularly longlining and trawl fisheries, but also recreational fisheries. The ecosystem effects from shark control programs are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. Historical and current nets were considered in the assessment of ecosystem condition, noting ongoing efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of shark control measures in KwaZulu-Natal.\n:::\n\n::: {#box3 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Box 1. Improvements in shark control measures\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has taken several steps to reduce the impacts of lethal shark control measures on marine species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 Km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025. Nets have been replaced with baited drum lines in several areas and a distinct seasonal strategy was introduced to reduce negative impacts while maintaining bather safety. In particular, nets are removed during the annual sardine run during winter to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities on sharks and other species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025, with the replacement of some nets by baited drumlines. Seasonal changes during the annual sardine run and whale migration see most of the remaining nets substituted with drumlines to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities of sharks and other species.\n\nExperimental work on mesh size, acoustic pingers and other innovations to reduce impacts have also been conducted and there is ongoing research to improve the evidence base for shark management. Overall, there is a reported 80% reduction in total catch and substantially reduced mortalities of sharks and other marine species (KZN Sharks Board pers. comm.). A network of researchers tag sharks and use satellite and acoustic tracking to better understand shark movement. Such data are very useful in better understanding shark distribution and risks in terms of location, season and other temporal trends. Increased investment in research, particularly movement studies, could strengthen the knowledge base for managing human wildlife conflict in the marine realm.\n\nOther provinces have implemented non-lethal measures that have little to no impact on marine life and these measures are not included as a pressure layer in this assessment. Local conditions affect the feasibility of different models with history of shark control, visibility, sea conditions, vantage points, launch site proximity and the local infrastructure and networks affecting options for shark control and bather safety. Bather exclusion nets and a shark spotter programme help protect bathers in Cape Town, while Plettenberg Bay has also implemented shark spotters and an innovative network to support bather safety ([NSRI technology](https://www.nsri.org.za/2024/07/shark-alarm-in-plettenberg-bay-enhancing-beach-safety-with-innovative-technology/)). Two other countries that have shark control programs recently introduced new non-lethal measures including drones to help detect sharks and smart drumlines that alert crew when an animal takes the bait so that they can launch immediately to free any bycatch and euthanise (severely injured) target sharks (Reunion Island) or translocate them (Australia). There are increasing studies that support the development and testing of shark-bite mitigation measures, however a lack of standardisation challenges effective comparisons of these measures [@riley2026].\n:::\n\n### Coastal and offshore mining\n\n::: {#box4 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Coastal and offshore mining is increasing in South Africa, targeting diamonds, heavy minerals and sand, and depending on the method of extraction, can have moderate to very severe negative impacts on biodiversity.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nImpacts include habitat destruction and modification (including beach morphodynamic type), sediment suspension and increased turbidity, pollution, noise, changes in the distribution and feeding habits of species and the introduction of alien species. Ecosystems that are impacted include beaches and shallow and deep benthic ecosystems on the shelf [@biccard2018; @rangel-buitrago2023; @manona2024].\n\nSuspended and deposited sediments caused by operations decrease feeding efficiency of filter feeders and clog fish gills, while increased turbidity from mine tailings can reduce primary production with reported changes in community structure. The potential for phosphate mining to commence remains a concern because the impacts of this activity could severely modify large areas of ecosystems and could jeopardise the sustainability of fisheries.\n\nMining affects vulnerable coastal communities and has impacts on small scale fishers who lose access to traditional fishing grounds . There are serious concerns that mining affects the rights of local communities in terms of food and culture and that mining may lead to risks to and impacts on natural and cultural heritage and aesthetic, recreational and tourism values.\n\nThe cumulative impacts of mining are a concern with increasing mining activity along South Africa’s West Coast and shelf. Although many environmental assessment practitioners may include a section on cumulative impacts in assessments, these are seldom comprehensive and usually fail to consider past, present and future impacts or other developments in the surrounding area. Currently, there is no marine biodiversity information in the screening tool used to support environmental impact assessments and very limited information for the marine realm was included in the biodiversity and mining guidelines produced in 2013.\n\nThe management of mining impacts could be improved through the inclusion and adequate consideration of cumulative impacts in mining authorizations, strategic planning and protection and the implementation of positive incentives for responsible mining (Priority actions [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-7), [1](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-4), [2](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-5), [6](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-9), [9](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-12) and [10](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-13)). There may be a need to strengthen monitoring and enforcement of mining activity for stronger compliance with environmental authorisation conditions.\n\nOther environmental management tools (such as Strategic Environmental Assessments and Environmental Management Frameworks) could be harnessed to support more strategic mining decisions to ensure that critical coastal and marine ecosystem services are maintained. Such measures could help manage and restore coastal ecological infrastructure, reduce risks to food security and improve the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities. Strengthening collaborative, biodiversity-inclusive planning is essential to safeguard natural capital while enabling mineral development (key message [A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)).\n:::\n\n### Marine petroleum activities\n\n![Pretroleum infrastructure on the Agulhas bank. (© Lara Atkinson)](imgs/oil_gas.png)\n\n::: {#box5 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Marine petroleum activities in South Africa were initiated in 1969 with more than 300 offshore wells drilled to date and ongoing exploration by seismic survey.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nThe impacts of petroleum activities span the impacts associated with exploration, production and transport. Petroleum production has been suspended at the Oribi/Oryx and Sable oil fields (Block 9 off Mossel Bay) and the F-A Gas field and satellites but field development plans are underway at the Ibhubesi gas field off Hondeklipbaai. While production has largely decreased in recent years in South Africa, exploration activities have expanded into deeper water (@fig-seismic) and there has been increasing concern about the negative impacts of seismic surveys, in particular, on marine species and ecosystems. This is because of the intense and widespread noise that these surveys generate, which can have varied, far-reaching and cumulative impacts on multiple species and ecosystem processes. A [cumulative map of seismic surveys](#fig-seismic) was recently compiled and there is some progress in planning for the integration of underwater noise into assessments and planning [@wilkinson2024]. [**See Pollution section**](#pollution).\n\nBiodiversity impacts associated with drilling and production include habitat loss from infrastructure installation; chemical pollution from water- and oil-based drilling muds, noise and light pollution. These impacts can cause physical and physiological damage to marine organisms, disrupt feeding, communication and migration and alter species distributions and aggregations. Petroleum infrastructure including pipelines for transport can also introduce, provide refuge for and facilitate the spread of alien and invasive species. Oil spills, leaks and blowouts pose serious risks with the potential to cause catastrophic impacts to marine biodiversity by oiling marine organisms, degrading ecosystems, and disrupting ecological processes, while also causing health risks to people. The chemical dispersants used in cleaning up oil spills can also impact marine life, and in some cases, are considered more toxic than the oil itself.\n\nImproving the understanding of the biodiversity impacts from oil and gas activities will enable better mitigation and management of impacts. Given current uncertain impacts, precautionary management is recommended. Spatial planning (key message [A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)) can support development while safeguarding ecosystem services. To counter the uncertain impacts of seismic surveys (see [Understanding underwater radiated noise in South Africa’s oceans](#box-2)), there is a need to identify, map and safeguard noise sensitive ecosystems and species and review current mitigation measures in the context of international good practice (Priority actions [7](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-10) and [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6)).\n:::\n\n### Shipping\n\n::: {#box6 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Shipping is a widespread source of pressure in South Africa’s marine realm and is a key source of underwater noise and other pollution.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nSouth Africa is a maritime nation with considerable ship traffic and one of the highest concentrations of cargo ship and oil tanker traffic globally. While shipping is the dominant form of underwater noise in the ocean, affecting a broad range of marine species [@duarte2021], there are also other environmental and biodiversity impacts, including other forms of pollution (e.g. chemical pollution, accidental oil spills, air pollution and other), the introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling, and ship strikes (collisions between vessels and large marine animals).\n\nSouth Africa still needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013 ([Priority action 3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6)). More effective management of shipping in noise sensitive areas such as marine protected areas, including by regulating the maximum speed of vessels, can strengthen protection by reducing underwater noise levels and the risk of collisions. [**See Pollution section**](#pollution).\n:::\n\n### Coastal development\n\n::: {#box7 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Coastal development, including port development, is a significant cause of pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems, leading to ecosystem loss, interruption of physical and biological process, and compromises in ecosystem resilience and services [@majiedt2019; @claassens2022; @harris2025a; @harris2025]. Coastal development has also impacted coastal species and contributed to the pressures on coastal invertebrates.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nCoastal development within the littoral active zone deprives beaches of the sand stored in dunes and reduces coastal resilience to storms, high wave-energy events and sea-level rise, increasing risks to coastal communities and infrastructure. Such development can require expensive artificial movement of sand or other coastal engineering solutions to mitigate downstream erosion.\n\nIn addition to coastal development impacts, ports and harbours are the main points of introduction and refugia for invasive alien species, and activities associated with them contribute to ecosystem degradation from smothering, pollution, underwater noise and anchorage. Coastal disturbance is common at popular and accessible beaches (especially around access points), and includes trampling, dune destabilisation and disturbance of shore birds or other shore animals. For more information see the [**coastal realm pages**](../coast/cst_synthesis.qmd).\n\nBiodiversity-inclusive co-ordinated coastal and marine spatial planning ([key message A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)) is important in managing the impacts of coastal development and guiding the placement of new ports and harbours. Steps to prevent, detect and manage invasive species ([key message A4](../key-messages/kma4.qmd)) are needed in ports and harbours. Effective strategic restoration guided by robust science ([key message B3](../key-messages/kmb3.qmd)) can mitigate coastal development impacts. Avoiding and reducing the impacts of coastal development can support climate risk mitigation and science-based restoration could support in this context (Priority actions see [Action 10](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box13)).\n:::\n\n### Mariculture\n\n::: {#box8 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## The biodiversity impacts of mariculture depend on the species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, husbandry practices and environmental conditions at the site.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nMariculture along the South African coast includes farming of shellfish or finfish and takes the form of land-based operations that abstract seawater, pass it through a culture facility, and return it to the sea, and sea-based operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages suspended directly in the sea and a limited number of estuaries. Little research has been undertaken on the impacts of mariculture in South Africa but local work has highlighted the risks associated with eutrophication and the introduction of alien species, pathogens and diseases that can be transferred to wild stocks. For example, high stocking densities could potentially result in the evolution of native pathogens (especially viral and bacterial agents) to which wild fish do not have resistance. As such, mariculture can impact on ecosystem services.\n\nCurrently, sea-based mariculture takes place only in Saldanha Bay and Algoa Bay in South Africa. High retention and therefore lower rates of flushing of pollutants or elevated nutrient inputs in bays are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts of sea-based mariculture operations in these areas. Sea-based mariculture operations are also known to alter predator behaviour and movement patterns by causing them to aggregate in the vicinity of installations, and may therefore shift predation pressure on wild populations with resulting food web effects. Although there has been little success in sea-based aquaculture of bony fish in South Africa, mariculture remains a sector of projected growth, similar to petroleum and shipping.\n\nAppropriate placement of mariculture in feasible areas that have sufficient environmental quality for food production without undermining biodiversity conservation efforts is needed. Biodiversity-inclusive marine spatial planning can help provide an opportunity to support livelihoods, food security and the development of the blue economy while maintaining ecological infrastructure ([key message A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)). Mitigation measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species and pathogens, minimise impacts on and maintain water quality are critical in managing mariculture (Priority actions [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6), [9](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-12), [2](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-5) and [4](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-7)).\n:::\n\n### Freshwater flow reduction\n\n![Flow reduction threatens marine ecosystems, species and associated fisheries benefits. (© Bronwyn Goble, Oceanographic Reasearch Institute)](imgs/uThukela_plume_fluvial_fan_Bronwyn_Goble_ORI.png)\n\n::: {#box9 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Freshwater flow reduction to the coastal and marine environment occurs when water is abstracted from rivers or dammed higher up in the catchment, and/or the cycle of an estuary has been disrupted.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nThis results in freshwater, and the accompanying sediment that is vital to many marine biodiversity processes, failing to reach the sea. By reducing input of sediment that forms and maintain beaches, mud habitats and other unconsolidated sediment ecosystems, flow reduction leads to physical habitat changes including loss of beach and mud habitat, impacts on ecological functions and services including nursery functions, environmental cues, productivity, nutrient provision and food web processes [@majiedt2019]. Reductions in key fisheries catches linked to reduced flow with associated negative economic impacts have also been reported in South Africa.\n\n**A third of South Africa’s freshwater flow in rivers is estimated to no longer reach the ocean,** including approximately two-thirds of the potential freshwater flow of the Orange River and nearly a third of that for the Thukela River (the two largest catchments in South Africa). Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated and coordinated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure ([key message A7](../key-messages/kma7.qmd) and [priority action 4](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-7)).\n:::\n\n### Wastewater discharge\n\n![Waste water discharge impacts biodiversity, the economy and human health. (© Jean Tresfon)](imgs/DSC_0853_edit.jpg)\n\n::: {#box10 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Wastewater discharge represents a significant source of pollution and includes a range of inputs, including industrial and municipal effluents, brine discharges from desalination plants, effluents from aquaculture operations, and stormwater and agricultural runoff [@porter2018; @majiedt2019; @ojemaye2022; @tyohemba2022].\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nMore than 3 billion cubic metres of waste is discharged annually into South Africa’s marine environment through estuaries and outfalls, with municipal wastewater treatment facilities accounting for a significant portion of this. Wastewater discharge impairs water and sediment quality, and causes changes in the primary producer and benthic invertebrate communities near discharge points [@majiedt2019]. High organic and nutrient loading due to wastewater discharge causes excessive eutrophication, fuelling red tides, harmful algal blooms and anoxia, often leading to fish kills. Coastal groundwater discharge is similarly enriched by human settlements, impacting shore ecosystems.\n\nTypically, coastal water quality is substantially degraded near major urban centres, with greatest negative impacts in areas with weak flushing and long retention, in particular bays. Associated microbial pollution can also have serious health and socio-economic impacts. For example, poor water quality has resulted in beach closures and loss of recreational value and tourism income. [**See Pollution section**](#pollution). Restoring degraded sewerage infrastructure is one of the ways in which coastal water quality can be improved (Priority action [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6) and [4](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-7)).\n:::\n\n### Dredge disposal\n\n::: {#box12 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Dredge disposal is the dumping at sea of accumulated sediment from dredge material leading to smothering, increased turbidity, decreased primary production and other potential impacts [@smith1995; @smith2001].\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nDredging is a key service performed by the Ports Authority as part of harbour management and maintenance, whereby dredge material is collected from harbours to ensure that ships do not run aground. The type of disposal methodology applied, as well as the quality of the sediment being deposited, may amplify or mitigate these environmental impacts.\n\nAlthough the impacts of dredge disposal have not been examined in South Africa, the risk of introduction of pollutants into the ocean from dredge have been recognised. This risk can be managed through improved pollution management within ports and harbours to reduce the amount of potential transfer to the open ocean when dredge material is disposed of. International good practice also recommends the reuse of dredge material where feasible (e.g. beach nourishment).\n:::\n\n### Ammunition disposal\n\n![Ammunition disposal in the ocean poses several risks to both species and ecosystems. (© Jana Ulrich)](imgs/Jana_Ulrich_ammunition_KolbergerHeide-ju.png)\n\n::: {#box11 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Ammunition disposal was practised in demarcated areas of the offshore environment from 1970s until 1995, before the London Protocol (1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter) came into effect.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nDumped ammunition can cause damage to or smothering of ecosystems and habitat-forming species; potentially detonate, causing localised destruction; and corrode, causing pollution and toxicity, especially from heavy metals [@majiedt2019; @beldowski2019]. Elsewhere, there is evidence of munition compounds bioaccumulating in marine foodwebs, which is predicted to increase with time and with changes in ocean chemistry [@beck2022]. Presumably, dumped munitions in South Africa have corroded over the past 30-50 years, but the impacts are largely unknown. This pressure has ceased.\n:::\n\n### Renewable energy production\n\n::: {#box13 .callout-note .marine collapse=\"true\"}\n## Renewable energy production is important in achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts and supporting socio-economic growth in South Africa.\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\"></div>\nThe potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) in South Africa includes offshore wind, wave, current and thermal energy sources. Although no MRE projects currently exist, there are plans for development, e.g. a floating offshore windfarm at Richard’s Bay and energy generation from the Agulhas current has been under discussion for several years. Depending on the energy source, potential impacts of MRE include habitat disturbance and loss during construction, changes in hydrology, localised upwelling and electromagnetic fields, collision risks with wind or current turbines for seabirds and ocean life and increased ocean noise. Wave and current devices may negatively impact marine mammals, turtles, and fish through collision risk, electromagnetic fields, and underwater noise, and marine benthic and pelagic habitats and communities could be impacted by changes to natural seawater flows and sediment transport. Small installations would likely have localised minor impacts but large commercial arrays could significantly alter marine systems over time.\n\nEmerging renewable energy installations include planned photovoltaic solar plants for Saldanha and Cape Town, and planned green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia) initiatives for Boegoebaai, Saldanha Bay, and Coega. Green hydrogen development requires extensive new coastal and marine infrastructure, likely including desalination plants, with associated brine discharge being an important environmental concern for coastal ecosystems. Other potential impacts include pollution from the production and transportation of hydrogen derivatives, like ammonia or methanol, which use catalysts and chemicals that could contaminate soil or water if not properly managed.\n\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy remain important for mitigating climate change ([key message A1](../key-messages/kma1.qmd)). The marine realm may have a significant role to play in the just transition to renewable energy. Impacts of marine ecosystems and biodiversity will be dependent on the type and placement of renewable energy arrays. Biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning is the best mechanism to achieve appropriate placement, and more research is needed to understand potential impacts and guide mitigation measures.\n:::\n\n## Cross-cutting pressures {#Cross-cutting-pressures}\n\n### Pollution (including underwater noise) {#pollution}\n\nPollution is a cross-cutting pressure linked to many sectors with chemical (including plastic), pharmaceutical, noise and light pollution all increasing. Plastic, both micro- and macro-plastic, is pervasive and has been recorded at great depths and distance from shore, although its main source is land-based pollution. Plastic pollution has impacts on many marine species through ingestion and entanglement, especially seabirds, turtles, sharks and fish. South African research is increasing and providing valuable insights into this global concern [@bakir2020; @ryan2020; @sparks2020; @ferguson2024], which recently has also been linked to the spread of alien and invasive species and identified as a vector for toxic metals [@awe2025]. Other common pollutants in the marine realm are heavy metals and hydrocarbons, especially in ports and harbours [@mehlhorn2021; @mbandzi-phorego2024].\n\nIngestion and bioaccumulation of microplastics, metals, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products and other organic pollutants in animal tissues potentially leads to their biomagnification in marine food webs [@bakir2020; @ojemaye2022; @newman2024]. This poses toxic risks to lower and higher trophic level biota and humans who consume them. Bioaccumulation of pesticides and herbicides in coral reef organisms is an increasing concern [@porter2021; @tyohemba2022], while high concentrations of metals, other chemicals, and pollutants have been detected in sediments (especially in ports and harbours), surf zones of popular recreational beaches and in sponges within submarine canyons. These pollutants have also been found in turtles and their eggs, seabirds and seabird eggs, fish, cetaceans, sharks and marine mammals.\n\nLight pollution or artificial light at night can negatively impact species and ecosystems by interrupting species’ natural circadian rhythms, changing night-time activity through either negative or positive phototaxis [@duarte2019; @fobert2023]. Feeding, breeding and resting behaviours are affected with impacts on turtle hatchlings and seabirds and beach invertebrates of particular concern [@duarte2019; @harris2025a; @harris2025]. For example, several beach species including the Endangered Cape pill bugs, *Tylos capensis* (nocturnal sandy beach isopods; @harris2025a) are significantly less active at night when exposed to higher light intensities, which reduces their foraging time. Light pollution can also affect navigation of seabirds and cause grounding with risk of injury or mortality [@heswall2022]. There is increasing concern regarding the effect of artificial light at night on phytoplantkton and cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems and potential increased risks of harmful algal blooms with calls for increased research on this topic [@fonvielle2025].\n\nGood practice in mitigating light pollution includes measures to direct, shield and reduce duration, angle and intensity of light [@welch2024]. Effective communication about the impacts of artificial light at night and opportunities to address light pollution while supporting energy reduction and climate change is needed in South Africa. Reducing light pollution in protected and conserved areas is particularly important [@welch2024] and can also contribute to cultural heritage protection, star gazing opportunities and astronomy research.\n\nNoise pollution is an increasing concern, particularly in aquatic environments where sound conductivity is greater than in air and where many species rely on sound for prey location and communication [@nelms2016; @duarte2021]. Sources of sound include seismic surveys [@wilkinson2024], shipping traffic, bunkering [@pichegru2022], various other commercial activities, and boating. Elevated underwater noise can cause direct mortality, lower immunity and increase health risks, change species distributions and disrupt foraging when predators, prey, or both avoid noisy areas, and disrupt reproduction, communication and social behaviour.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cumulative map of seismic survey activity in the marine realm between 1980 and 2020 (Wilkinson et al. 2024).](imgs/seismic_pressure.png){#fig-seismic width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMarine mammals and soniferous fish are particularly at risk, including commercially important species such as kingklip, recreationally important species such as grunter and threatened species such as dusky kob and Syngnathid seahorses and pipefish. Recently, penguins have shown sensitivity to underwater noise [@pichegru2022] and there is concern that current mitigation measures for seismic surveys may be inadequate in managing impacts on marine animals [@purdon2025]. Although there are many known impacts from underwater noise, there are still many gaps in our understanding of these pressures [@elliott2019] and how they may translate into ecosystem impacts. It is recommended that noise sensitive marine areas are proactively mapped and used to inform marine spatial planning and management [@wilkinson2024] and there is increasing collaborative efforts to provide guidance in protecting marine fauna from noise.\n\n::: {#box-2 .callout-note .marine title=\"Box 2. Understanding underwater radiated noise in South Africa’s oceans.\" collapse=\"false\"}\nGlobally, there is increasing recognition of the impacts of anthropogenic noise pollution on a wide range of taxa and habitats, and South Africa is prioritising an improved understanding and reduced effects of underwater radiated noise on marine life. New research that has been initiated in this context includes the project “Sound Seas: Linking marine soundscapes to ecosystem conditions and health”. This is a multidisciplinary project funded by the National Research Foundation through the African Coelacanth Ecosystem Programme and spans acoustic research, biodiversity, ecology, fisheries, geology, oceanography and marine engineering.\n\nThe Sound Seas project aims to determine the extent to which the underwater marine soundscape can provide information about the ecological condition of marine ecosystems and which tools (systems and methods) can be developed for monitoring these environments and assisting management, decision-making and policy. The team is developing capacity in underwater soundscape ecology and acoustics research in South Africa and will provide baselines for further research and monitoring on marine soundscapes and the impacts of anthropogenic noise sources.\n\n<!-- ![Kerry intends to provide image here that is on her phone (but note there is already a whale/sound image above?).

Pictured is *Carcinus maenas* an invasive crab found in South Africa. (© Charles Griffiths)](imgs/Carcinus_invasives.png)\n\nInvasive alien species have profound negative impact on marine biodiversity with increasing numbers of introduced marine species in South Africa [@miza2019; @robinson2020]. Alien species have the potential to displace native species, cause the loss of native genotypes, modify habitats, change community structure, affect food web properties and ecosystem processes, impede the provision of ecosystem services, impact human health and cause substantial economic losses.\n\nThe main mechanisms of accidental introductions are ship fouling, ballast water and mariculture [@vanwilgen2022], with increasing recognition of the role of petroleum infrastructure and recreational boating in the introduction and intra-regional spread of invasive species. The expanding aquarium trade is also a potential source of introductions.\n\nPreventing marine invasives and limiting spread is vital as research shows that eradication in the marine realm is not feasible. This means that prevention is critical and key pathways, particularly ballast water and hull fouling, require management action. Strategic monitoring is also recommended [@loureiro2021] and ringfenced resources are needed to enable rapid management action ([key message A4](../key-messages/kma4.qmd)).\n\nSouth Africa needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013 and invest in innovative methods and partnerships to reduce hull fouling and the spread of marine invasives (Priority actions [3](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-6) and [9](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-12)). Increased efforts are needed to prevent marine invasive species introduction in MPAs and coastal conservation areas. Innovative communication and citizen science can help inform industry and civil society to help prevent and detect introductions.\n\n### Climate change\n\n![Coral bleaching is a highly visible symptom of climate change. (© Sean Porter, Oceanographic Research Institute)](imgs/cc.JPG)\n\nClimate change exacerbates impacts of pressures on marine species and ecosystems through multifaceted pathways, decreasing resilience and threatening coastal communities and livelihoods [@kelly2019; @duncan2019; @mbokodo2020]. South Africa’s oceans are changing with increased winds, upwelling and cooling being observed in some areas, and warming in others [@vanwilgen2022]. Increased storm events, sea-level rise, intensification of current variability and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events have also been observed, and work is underway to support baselines to detect any potential changes in pH through ocean acidification [@edworthy2022; @porter2022; @edworthy2023].\n\nThe impacts of these changes have been documented across a wide variety of marine taxa including kelp, other seaweeds, foraminifera, corals, sponges, molluscs, crustaceans, copepods, fish and seabirds [@mcclanahan2024]. Reported impacts include shifts in the distribution of species and communities, changes in species abundance, altered behaviour, hybridisation, increased spread of invasive species, and long-term declines in fished stocks and copepods. Coral bleaching is increasing [@porter2021] and there is a need to invest in coral monitoring to track reef health. South Africa’s three coral ecosystem types are now considered Vulnerable to ecosystem collapse (see [threat status page](marine_ets.qmd#vulnerable)) and 34% of the 128 shallow reef building corals reported in South Africa have now been assessed as threatened ([see species summary page](../species/marine_sp.qmd)).\n\nClimate change does not act in isolation, it interacts with other anthropogenic pressures and understanding these interactions is critical for effective conservation and climate mitigation strategies to protect biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability [@cooley2023]. The complexity and variability of South Africa’s marine systems, combined with multiple anthropogenic stressors, make future climate impacts difficult to predict, but there is high certainty that negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security and valuable economic industries will continue to escalate.\n\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy are important for mitigating climate change ([key message A1](../key-messages/kma1.qmd)). In addition, coastal ecological infrastructure should be maintained and restored in the interests of coastal climate change adaptation. Climate-buffering ecological infrastructure such as wave attenuating reefs and kelp forests and intact coastal dune systems can be safeguarded and restored through improved coastal planning and science-based restoration.\n\nProgress could be supported through integrated solutions involving biodiversity, society and climate action ([key message A1](../key-messages/kma1.qmd)), biodiversity-inclusive co-ordinated coastal and marine spatial planning ([key message A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)), and strategic restoration guided by robust science ([key message B3](../key-messages/kmb3.qmd)). Multiple potential indicators of progress in reducing climate risks to people and marine biodiversity have been identified (see priority actions [9](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-12) and [10](marine_priority_actions.qmd#box-13)).\n\n## Approach\n\nPressure data are a key input into ecosystem assessments including the assessment of ecosystem condition, ecosystem threat status and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The 2025 marine ecosystem assessment drew largely on the pressure data and information from the previous assessment [@sink2019b], in which Majiedt et al. (2019) comprehensively reviewed and mapped 31 sources of pressure (spatial extent and intensity where feasible) on marine biodiversity in South Africa. These included 19 fisheries sectors, lethal shark control measures, mining, petroleum, shipping, ports and harbours, coastal development, coastal disturbance, mariculture, invasive species, freshwater flow reduction, waste water discharge, dredge material disposal and ammunitions dumping. Climate change literature was reviewed and synthesised [@kelly2019] and invasive species research [@miza2019] was also considered.\n\nLimited progress in pressure mapping was achieved for the 2025 assessment but seismic surveys and submarine cables were mapped for inclusion in future assessments and an improved, finer resolution demersal trawl fishing layer was compiled [@currie2023]. Literature reviews and new collaborations to improve research on underwater noise ( Sink et al. 2021, Kirkman research strat? , [@wilkinson2024])[need to add references once Noku is done]{.mark} helped collate literature, provide insights and identify research priorities for understanding the potential impacts and mitigation options for seismic surveys. The information available in the National Data and Information Report for Marine Spatial Planning provided relevant information in terms of the impacts and mitigation of pressures in the marine realm. Work towards an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for South Africa [@skein2022] also improved the understanding of pressure on marine biodiversity and was a key informant in the 2025 assessment.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAll contributors to the 2018 pressure assessment are acknowledged.
