South Africa’s freshwater fish conservation challenge\n\nFreshwater fish are among the most threatened species groups in South Africa, and the majority of the country’s endemic fish species are in ongoing decline. Key threats include human impacts on water quality and quantity, habitat destruction and the impacts of invasive species – threats that often act synergistically and can be compounded by climate change. \n\nIn 2024, as groundwork for the Reverse the Red World Species Congress, members of the National Freshwater Fish Observation Group (including SANBI, SAIAB, CapeNature, Freshwater Research Centre) undertook a rapid assessment of South African freshwater fish species most urgently in need of recovery action, including species with recovery efforts already underway. The focus was on species with an Endangered or Critically Endangered conservation status, and those with a declining population trajectory. \n\nAssessments were attempted for 26 described freshwater fish species, and 10 recognised genetically distinct lineages. Expert knowledge was used to identify priority conservation actions for each taxon, as well as the cost for implementing these actions. Assessments were completed for nine of the 26 described species and for five of the 10 genetic lineages; however, experts noted low confidence for several of these assessments. Furthermore, 12 of the taxa were not assessed at all due to insufficient expert knowledge. \n\nOf the assessed taxa: all were considered in need of management actions and/or associated research; 11 were identified as in need of ex situ breeding programmes; 10 taxa were expected to benefit from new stewardship sites;  and all 14 were considered in need of further research to identify the most suitable recovery actions. Investment in freshwater fish recovery efforts over the past 10 years was estimated at R18 million – a figure that would need to be increased nearly tenfold (to at least R168 million) to meet the recovery needs of freshwater fish species in South Africa over the next 5-10 years.  \n\n##  2. Summary of key recovery efforts for South African freshwater fish over the past 5 years\n\nDespite the large knowledge gaps and investment required to recover these species, there are a growing number of freshwater fish recovery efforts underway, some of which have made measurable progress towards reviving some of the country’s most imperilled freshwater fish species. This section summarises key recovery efforts focussing on threatened South African freshwater fish taxa over the past 5 years.\n\n\n::::: grid\n::: {.g-col-lg-4 .g-col-12 .text-center}\n![*Tylos granulatus* © Linda Harris](./imgs/sp_freshwaterfish_img_6.png){style=\"width:400;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-lg-8 .g-col-12}\n## Tradouw redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli (CR)\n:::\n:::::\nabstraction prevent successful recruitment, relocating them into off-stream “sanctuary” dams free of alien species, growing them until they reach a size that reduces predation risk, marking them with PIT tags, and then releasing them back into the wild once they are large enough to avoid predation by invasive fish like bass (Micropterus spp.). Progress to date includes the rescue of over 45,000 juveniles, the establishment of six sanctuary dams, and the reintroduction of over 5,000 “bass-proof” fish into the wild. An ongoing PIT tag study shows that up to 20% of these fish return to the Biedouw River with the annual spawning migration in spring, translating into a an estimated nearly four-fold increase in the Biedouw spawning sandfish population. In 2024/5, a habitat restoration intervention was undertaken to restore 9 km of critical sandfish habitat in the upper Biedouw River through the removal of invasive fish and plants, and the construction of  a barrier weir to prevent future reinvasion. By combining an urgent on-the-ground head-start programme with longer-term habitat restoration, the project seeks to transition from emergency intervention to establishing self-sustaining wild sandfish populations. \n\nFunders: National geographic Society, Species Survival Commission, Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, IUCN Save our Species, Foundation Segre, European Union, Rufford Foundation, Ford Wildlife Foundation, Federation of South African Flyfishers, Mount Ceder, Bushmanskloof, Alu-Cab.\n\n\n::::: grid\n::: {.g-col-lg-4 .g-col-12 .text-center}\n![*Tylos granulatus* © Linda Harris](./imgs/sp_freshwaterfish_img_6.png){style=\"width:400;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-lg-8 .g-col-12}\n## Tradouw redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli (CR)\n:::\n:::\n\nThis project is led by SAIAB, in collaboration with the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA), retired specialists, students and staff from Nelson Mandela University (NMU), and the Eswatini Department of Fisheries. All historical collection sites for the Orange-fringed largemouth bream have been resurveyed, revealing a substantial decline in both population size and area of occurrence. The main threats are invasion by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the lower Lomati River in South Africa, and pollution from gold mining in the upper river reaches in Eswatini. Based on these findings, the species has been reassessed under the IUCN Red List and uplisted to Critically Endangered (assessment under review).\n\nTo support recovery, farm dams within or near the Lomati catchment have been stocked with wild-caught and captive-bred individuals. To date, 23 dams have been stocked in Eswatini and South Africa (including dams within the Kruger National Park), with an estimated ~50% showing signs of success by 2025. Additional stocking has also been done in the upper river within the species’ historical range. The captive breeding programme has been highly successful, with >30 breeding events producing ~1 500 juveniles. However, under IUCN guidelines, stocked individuals can only be considered part of the natural population once they persist independently in natural systems for at least ten years, as this species generation length is estimated as 3-4 years (active research underway to confirm this estimate). In total, more than 30 000 fish (wild and captive-bred) have been stocked in dams.\n\nWorking with local farmers has enabled access to suitable dams and logistical support. In Eswatini, engagement with the Department of Fisheries aims to support community-based dam management to prevent over-harvesting, as these dams provide food resources. Concurrently, multiple Master’s research projects are underway (2023–2027, NMU Saasveld) is study the age, growth and fecundity of the species to inform a sound long-term conservation plan. The current project phase ends in 2025, but key activities — including additional stocking, monitoring and completion of biological research — will continue to 2027.\n\nFunders: Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund.\n\n\n### Recommended citation\n\nShelton, J., Cerrilla, C., Jordaan, M., Bills, R., Anderson, A., Brink, E., Raimondo, D.C., Chakona, A., Job, N., Van Der Colff, D., & Monyeki, M.S. 2025.
