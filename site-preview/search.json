    "text": "Monitoring genetic diversity using indicators\nGenetic diversity underpins all biological diversity, playing a key role in individual fitness (an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce), species’ ability to adapt to changing environments, and overall ecosystem resilience. The genetic diversity of many wild species has declined in recent decades and greater declines are projected through ongoing habitat loss and population size reductions. Local extinctions, reduced population sizes and disruption of genetic connectivity mean that many of the populations that exist today have insufficient genetic diversity to persist in the long term.\nCore Conservation Genetic Principles\nConservation monitoring is guided by key principles (Figure 1), which together capture genetic diversity at multiple scales:\n\nSafeguard evolutionary distinctiveness – preserves unique branches of the tree of life.\nProtect genetically distinct populations – maintains adaptive potential within species.\nEnsure populations are large enough for long-term persistence – reduces loss of diversity through genetic drift1 and inbreeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Representation of three core conservation genetic principles focused on safeguarding evolutionary distinctiveness (A & B), protecting genetically distinct populations to minimise the risk of losing evolutionary evolutionary distinctiveness and ensuring all populations are large enough to ensure their long-term persistence (C). Red lines represent deep phylogenetic branches at risk, which can be caused by either entire clades of species being threatened with extinction (e.g., pangolins; A) or by threatened species isolated on long branches of the phylogenetic tree (e.g., secretary bird, B). C: Dashed lines represent the loss of a genetically distinct amphibian population, while polygons with solid lines represent different existing populations, each differing in size with the largest being the most likely to avoid genetic erosion. A & B taken from Gumbs et al., 2023.\n\n\n\nIn line with these principles, South Africa has adopted four genetic indicators from the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which can be based on direct genetic data or on proxies (when genetic data are not available; namely the Ne 500 and PM indicators).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Proportion of populations with an effective population size greater than 500 (Ne 500 indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA headline indicator in the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a high-level, mandatory metric that captures the overall scope of Goal A and Target 4 of the GBF.\nEffective population size (Ne) represents the number of individuals in a population contributing to the gene pool. At any given time or reproductive cycle not all adults reproduce, consequently Ne is a subset of the number of individuals in a population (typically 10 to 30% of the census size). Studies have identified a threshold of Ne greater than 500 signifying a genetically stable and healthy population into the long term; while below 500, the risk of extinction increases. The Ne 500 indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no populations of a species have Ne above 500 and 1 indicating all populations exceed the 500 threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Proportion of populations maintained within species (PM indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA complementary indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework, providing additional context for in-depth analysis but is not required for reporting.\nThis indicator is based on the principle that genetic differences increase as populations are farther apart in geographic and/or environmental distance. By maintaining distinct populations, species are more able to adapt and evolve. The PM indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating all populations have been lost (species is extinct) and 1 indicating that all populations are still present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Changing status of evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species (EDGE index)\n\n\n\n\n\nA component indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a detailed metric that measures progress towards a specific target or goal within the framework.\nThis index is grounded in the understanding that genetically distinctive and threatened species would represent a significant loss to the tree of life if they are lost, making their preservation crucial. It is a tool for monitoring the changes in the conservation status of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage. For each taxonomic group that has a phylogeny, a value of 0 indicates that none of the genetically distinctive species are threatened and a value of 1 indicates that all genetically distinctive species are threatened with extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis complementary indicator is estimated as the total phylogenetic diversity in a phylogeny weighted by the probability of extinction for each species. This can be expressed as a percentage of the total phylogenetic diversity for the clade, where 100% would indicate that all species have the highest possible probability of extinction and all PD is expected to be lost, while 0% suggests that all species are safe from extinction and no PD is expected to be lost. The larger number of threatened species that contribute to high phylogenetic diversity, the more diversity is expected to be lost into the future.",

Of these, 90 species had sufficient data to quantify the PM indicator, and 61 species had sufficient data to quantify the Ne 500 indicator. South reported a PM value of 0.95 and Ne 500 value of 0.42. This indicates that, while South Africa has maintained the majority of its species’ populations, they are smaller than what is needed to ensure their long-term persistence and the overall adaptive potential of the species (key message B3). While this first assessment incorporated a relatively small number of species, the species included were from a wide variety of taxonomic groups, ecosystems, distributions and conservation statuses.\nImportantly, these national metrics can be disaggregated in various ways, such as by taxonomic group (Table 1) or conservation status (Figure 2), to explore patterns and trends across different biodiversity components, similar to species and ecosystems assessments.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Tracking the expected loss of phylogenetic diversity\n\nA case study on South Africa’s amphibians and reptiles\nSouth Africa is home to exceptionally rich and evolutionarily unique biodiversity, the loss of which would represent a significant erosion of the country’s evolutionary heritage. Using comprehensive Red List assessments together with detailed evolutionary (phylogenetic) trees, researchers can estimate how much of this evolutionary heritage could be lost if threatened species go extinct – a metric known as Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity – the proportion of evolutionary history likely to be lost if currently threatened species go extinct.\nIn a recent case study2, this approach was applied to South Africa’s amphibians and reptiles, both of which have exceptionally high levels of endemism (around 50%). By integrating extinction risk data with measures of phylogenetic diversity (PD), researchers found that, without conservation action, about 6.5% of amphibian PD and 5% of reptile PD could be lost over the next 50 years (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The PD indicator for South African amphibians (red) and reptiles (purple), calculated at three intervals between 1990 and 2020. Values are estimated as the percentage of phylogenetic diversity (PD) expected to be lost within 50 years3. Dated national phylogenies were used along with probabilities of extinction, inferred from backcasted IUCN scores weighted according to Gumbs et al. (2023) (CR = 0.97, EN = 0.49, VU = 0.24, NT = 0.12, and LC = 0.06).\n\n\n\nImportantly, areas rich in PD did not always coincide with regions of high species richness, revealing new priorities for conservation to protect large portions of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity for South African A) amphibians and B) reptiles, generated using national phylogenies where branch lengths were weighted by the probability of all descendant species becoming extinct3. The highest risk for both groups is estimated to be found in the tropical east, while for amphibians, notable concentrations appear in montane regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. For reptiles, extreme concentrations of expected PD loss can be found in the north-east of KwaZulu-Natal and in the north-west of the Northern Cape Province.\n\n\n\nThis study provides a national framework for monitoring phylogenetic biodiversity and its expected loss, aligned with global biodiversity monitoring goals. It demonstrates an approach that can be extended to other taxonomic groups, helping ensure that conservation strategies safeguard not only species, but also the deep evolutionary lineages and adaptive potential that make South Africa’s biodiversity globally unique.",

One of the most pressing issues is the lack of resources, including funding, laboratory infrastructure, and trained personnel. Many forensic laboratories operate under constrained budgets, which affects their ability to process cases efficiently and invest in new technologies. Another major challenge is the absence of standardised protocols across institutions. Without harmonised procedures, results may vary between laboratories, which can undermine the credibility of forensic evidence in legal proceedings. Establishing national standards for sample collection, DNA analysis, and data interpretation is essential to ensure consistency and reliability. A third challenge is the limited availability of species-specific reference databases. These databases are crucial for accurate species identification, individual profiling, and geographic origin determination. However, building such databases requires extensive sampling, expert taxonomic verification, and long-term investment. For rare and endangered species, collecting sufficient reference data is particularly difficult.",

    "text": "South Africa’s coastal zone has exceptional biodiversity, with 190 coastal ecosystem types supporting many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. The coast also provides numerous benefits to people, including food and materials, places to relax and play, and protection from storms and large waves. This means that the coast is also exposed to a number of pressures from human activities, on which the impacts of invasive species and climate change are superimposed. As a result, only half of South Africa’s coast is still in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter of the coast is severely to critically modified. Given the extent and severity of ecological degradation, 71% of the coastal ecosystem types are threatened. There is good progress in protecting coastal biodiversity, with a third (19%) of coastal ecosystem types meeting their targets for protection, such that they are considered Well Protected. This needs to be strengthened, however, because a quarter (14%) of the coastal ecosystem types are Not Protected. There are also 68 ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected). Restoring, managing and conserving coastal biodiversity in South Africa are key steps towards sustainable development, securing jobs and livelihoods, alleviating poverty, and enhancing human health and wellbeing. Planning cross-realm, in support of these actions, is essential.",

    "text": "Introduction\nSouth Africa’s coast is a national asset, rich in biodiversity, history and cultures that are all woven into the fabric of our national heritage. Despite comprising only 4% of the mainland extent, the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) includes nearly a fifth (20%, i.e., 190) of its 952 ecosystem types.\nThe South African coast has exceptional biodiversity, with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth, particularly along the national south coast. This is largely a result of the strongly contrasting conditions around the coast, driven by the warm Agulhas Current sweeping down the east coast, and cool Benguela Current up the west coast, with distinct patterns in temperature, rainfall and geology that create the physical underpinning of South Africa’s coastal biological diversity1.\nThe coast also provides a wealth of benefits to the economy, society, and human health and wellbeing that sustain and enrich the lives of many South Africans2. These include both tangible and intangible benefits, such as: provision of food, medicine and useful materials; coastal protection and disaster-risk reduction; water filtration, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration; tourism; job opportunities; places that support health, wellbeing, social cohesion, sports events, cultural and spiritual practices; and opportunities for learning and connecting with nature.\nThe coast is a relatively small area, but comprises a treasure trove of biodiversity and benefits for all South Africans to enjoy. It is no wonder that visiting South Africa’s beaches is one of the most popular tourism experiences by both local and international visitors.",

    "text": "Coastal ecosystem types\nThere are 190 coastal ecosystem types in South Africa, comprising 83 terrestrial, 22 estuarine, and 85 marine ecosystem types1. These ecosystems range from warm, mesic tropical and subtropical types in the north-east, to cool, arid and upwelling-driven types in the west. All of these ecosystem types have influences from both the land and the sea (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone in South Africa.1\n\n\n\nAlthough not currently included in the EDCZ, freshwater ecosystem types are likely to be included in future, particularly the coastal lakes, swamp forests (freshwater forested wetlands), dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones. There are also three micro-estuary types that are within the EDCZ; however, they are not currently assessed, and thus are not included in the count of coastal ecosystem types to simplify reporting.\nRead more »",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal biodiversity\nCoastal ecosystems in South Africa are under more cumulative pressure than the non-coastal areas of the mainland territory, with habitat loss on land occurring twice as fast in the coastal zone.\n\n\n\nMining (for diamonds, heavy-minerals, and sand) is a significant pressure in South Africa’s coastal zone, causing habitat fragmentation, degradation and loss, and increasing species extinction risk. There is proportionately five times more mining in the coast than in the rest of South Africa. (© Fiona MacKay)\n\n\nThe most intensive pressures in South Africa’s coastal zone are biological resource use, mining, and coastal development. Unsustainable harvesting (including from poaching) is driving overexploited stock status and extinction risk in some species. Serial mining along the west coast and illegal mining are notable causes of concern, and are also key drivers of species extinction risk. Coastal development removes natural habitat and causes coastal squeeze as sea levels rise.\nReduced freshwater flow through estuaries impacts estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems as far offshore as the shelf edge in some places, with knock-on effects for coastal tourism, human health, and food and job security. Related to this is reduce sand delivery to the coast through rivers and estuaries. Between this and poor management of mobile dunefields, many beaches are sand-starved and in a state of erosion.\nPorts and harbours are key drivers of cumulative coastal impacts and ecological degradation by providing points of access to the sea, leading to burgeoning development, changing local shoreline orientation, and being pressure hotspots. Other transport and service corridors (roads, railway lines, shipping) also impact coastal ecosystems by replacing natural habitat, disrupting land-sea connectivity, and increasing pollution and the risk of invasive alien species.\nMany forms of pollution are impacting coastal biodiversity cross-realm, including chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals), sewage, plastics, light, noise, and dumped obsolete ammunition, but many of these pollutants are understudied and poorly understood, especially at a national scale. Deteriorating water quality from wastewater discharge, urban runoff, and agricultural runoff is a key issue in the coastal zone, particularly in retentive systems like estuaries and bays.\nBoth invasive species and climate change are exacerbating pressures to coastal biodiversity by changing natural ecological processes and reducing resilience of indigenous species. Some of the most important climate change impacts for coastal systems are sea-level rise, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms and floods, changes in rainfall and runoff, and temperature change, particularly temperature extremes in the form of heatwaves, and thermal shock when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling.\nRead more »",

Proportionately, there more than double the amount of modified habitat in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas.\nRead more »\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Coastal ecological condition, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Ecological condition of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem threat status\nThe criteria in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems were applied to determine ecosystem threat status for the terrestrial, estuarine and marine assessments, with the results summarised here for the coastal ecosystem types. Ecosystem types were assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable (collectively referred to as threatened), Near Threatened, or Least Concern.\nThere are 134 (71%) threatened coastal ecosystem types that comprise 46% of the coastal extent, compared to 101 (22%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise 6% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea). Proportionately, this means the coast has three times the number of threatened ecosystem types and almost an order of magnitude (eight times) more threatened area than the rest of the South African mainland territory (Figure 4, Figure 5).\nRead more »\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

However, improvements in data and methods have shown a more threatened status of the coast compared with that reported in 2018.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level was determined by calculating the proportion of each ecosystem type in a protected area, and evaluating these against a predefined biodiversity target per ecosystem type, with heuristics regarding the ecological condition of the ecosystem types under protection. Ecosystem types are assigned one of four categories of protection: Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP).\nThere is good progress in representing coastal ecosystem types in protected areas, with 86% of 190 coastal ecosystem types now having some level of protection. However, only 19% of coastal ecosystem types are Well Protected, covering just 7% of the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ), meaning 81% of coastal ecosystem types covering 93% of the EDCZ are not yet meeting their biodiversity targets for protection (Figure 6, Figure 7).\nRead more »\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (a) number of types and (b) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are also not comparable with those from the NBA 2018 because of changes in biodiversity targets and assessment methodologies.\n\n\nCoastal ecosystem types at highest risk of loss\nThe ecosystem types that are at highest risk of loss can be identified by intersecting the results of the ecosystem threat status and protection level analyses, and sub-setting the results to the most threatened and most under-protected ecosystem types (Table 1). \n\n\n\n\nTable 1. NBA 2025 assessment results for South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types. Threat status: CR = Critically Endangered, EN = Endangered, VU = Vulnerable, NT = Near Threatened, LC = Least Concern. Protection level: WP = Well Protected, MP = Moderately Protected, PP = Poorly Protected, NP = Not Protected.

Sixty-Eight of these are high risk, because they are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered and Poorly Protected or Not Protected) Figure 8.\nRead more »\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.

    "text": "Knowledge gaps and research priorities\nNineteen knowledge gaps have been identified as research priorities to strengthen further coastal biodiversity foundational knowledge and understanding of impacts to coastal biodiversity2. Addressing these gaps will help to improve future assessments, and better understand the benefits of biodiversity and the best ways of communicating the these in a way that most inspires South African’s into action for change towards long-term sustainability. These 19 knowledge gap–research priority clusters are grouped under four themes:\n\n\nFoundational data and knowledge\n\n1. Advance the map of coastal ecosystem types\n\nImprove the rocky shore classification by advancing the wave exposure mapping from an expert-based layer to one underpinned by quantitative analysis.\nRevisit the classification and mapping of mixed shore ecosystem types.\nComplete the current, unpublished work on beach biogeography to confirm whether the tropical biogeographic break matches with that for estuaries and rocky shores, or whether it is indeed further north.\nImprove mapping of estuary plumes (sediment-laden water) and fluvial fans (accumulations of terrigenous sediment on the seabed) to support delineation of river-influenced ecosystem types.\nImprove classification and mapping of boulder and cobble shores.\nRevisit how micobialites are represented in the map of ecosystem types.\nVerify the inland extent of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\nRevisit the classification of seashore vegetation types to determine whether the dune sub-types should be classified and assessed per each of four seashore types, or if some of the sub-types need to be elevated to the level of a separate seashore vegetation type.\nRevisit the classification of inland wetlands to determine whether there are those that should be classified as coastal and included in the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n2. Improve taxonomic knowledge; map and assess coastal species\n\nImprove taxonomic knowledge, species distribution mapping and Red Listing of species.\nUndertake more recent surveys on which to base some of the ecosystem assessments (e.g., Estuarine Health Index).\n\n3. Address realm-specific foundational knowledge gaps to strengthen the coastal assessment\n\nAddressing realm-specific foundational knowledge gaps (e.g., relating to taxonomy, species distributions, genetic diversity, ecosystem mapping, and condition assessments) would contribute to strengthening the coastal assessment.\n\n\n\n\nPressures, pressure impacts and monitoring\n\n4. Map pressures and assess ecological condition at appropriate scales\n\nRefine the maps of pressures, particularly at the land-sea interface across the dunes and the shore.\nEnsure coastal pressures (especially in the seashore) are mapped at an appropriate resolution.\nUpdate the pressure maps where the data have become outdated.\n\n5. Map additional terrestrial pressures to include degradation as part of assessing ecological condition\n\nCoordinate national effort to measure, model, and map ecological condition in the terrestrial realm at a scale suitable for Red List of Ecosystem assessments and for reporting on international indicators.\n\n6. Determine freshwater- and sediment-flow requirements for coastal and marine systems\n\nQuantify the ecological flow requirements for all of South Africa’s estuaries, enhance understanding of the role of freshwater flow to offshore marine environments, and map of fluvial fans and plumes to support the classification and mapping of mud habitats.\nInvestigate sediment flows to beaches nationally to quantify contributions from different sand sources, and determine which beaches are being lost to erosion because they are losing sand at rates over and above natural cycles of sand loss and gain.\n\n7. Collect long-term data to improve models of climate change, and track impacts to coastal biodiversity\n\nDevelop and implement a cohesive framework and indicators to track biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts as a result of climate change, identify critical thresholds or points of non-return, and assess the effectiveness of interventions to minimise these impacts.\nEnsure that reliable weather station data are available throughout the South African coast.\n\n8. Map and better understand the impact of emerging pressures on coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove understanding of emerging pressures, e.g., various forms of pollution (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, light and noise), renewable energy, invasive species, and climate change.\nMap impacts of these pressures for inclusion in future assessments.\n\n9. Improve understanding of ecosystem degradation and links between pressures and impacts\n\nImprove understanding of interactions and impacts among pressures, and of cross-realm impacts to biodiversity.\n\n10. Groundtruth and refine thresholds for classifying ecological condition from habitat degradation\n\nGroundtruth maps of ecological condition with in situ measures and indicators, and use these to confirm thresholds for the categories of ecological condition.\n\n11. Invest in strategic long-term coastal biodiversity monitoring programmes\n\nCoordinate monitoring programmes that cover a range of taxa and a range of ecosystem types , e.g., Shallow Marine and Coastal Research Infrastructure (SMCRI).\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n12. Improve application of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria by testing scale and thresholds and creating models of ecosystem collapse\n\nDevelop conceptual models of ecosystem collapse.\nContinue testing different approaches to applying the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria and thresholds, in alignment with the latest guidelines, to advance red listing coastal ecosystem types.\n\n13. Investigate the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity as a second indicator for ecosystem protection level\n\nBuild on existing research to better understand effectiveness of protected areas in conserving coastal biodiversity, particularly cross-realm.\n\n14. Increase Red Listing of species, especially invertebrate and cross-realm species\n\nPrioritise assessment and monitoring of coastal species, including assessment of full taxonomic groups, of coastal species with high levels of potential threat, particularly endemic taxa (including invertebrates) and those that cross realms.\n\n15. Update and increase the number of fisheries stock status assessments\n\nIncrease reliable data for stock status assessments.\nIncrease the number of national stock assessments (especially for highly utilised economically important species).\n\n16. Assess the protection level of coastal species\n\nAssess the two components of species protection level: representation and effectiveness. This will need to be backed up with research on management effectiveness of protected areas for coastal taxa.\n\n17. Map and assess the status of coastal ecological infrastructure\n\nMap critical ecological infrastructure and assess its status. Systematic mapping of critical ecological infrastructure could be integrated into CBA Maps to add value to spatial planning and prioritisation towards securing the many benefits South Africans gain from coastal biodiversity\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and messaging\n\n18. Collect data and knowledge on the benefits of coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove collation of economic data, updated statistics on jobs and spatial data on biodiversity benefits.\n\n19. Identify strategies of communicating the benefits of biodiversity that most inspire action for change\n\nTest and identify methods of communication that best inspire action for change to complement communicating the results of the benefits of coastal biodiversity to people.",

These actions also align well with the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 and Targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nNow more than ever, South Africa is poised to secure key coastal biodiversity and ecological infrastructure: half the coast is in natural to near-natural ecological condition, and the integrated map of ecosystem types3,4 and results from this assessment pave the way for better biodiversity planning, management and decision-making in the coastal zone.\nCross-realm planning is essential to ensure that land-sea ecological processes and species distributions are adequately accounted for in land-based and marine Spatial Biodiversity Plans (Maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas - CBA Maps, and associated land and sea-use guidelines). These Spatial Biodiversity Plans are a key tool by which to align governance, planning and decision-making across realms and across organs of state to achieve effective, science-based and proactive integrated coastal zone management1.",

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem threat status is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It is an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact or, alternatively, losing vital aspects of their structure, function or composition.\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the end point for ecosystem decline. The framework comprises a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition, and threatening processes.\nEach ecosystem type is assessed according to these criteria, and is then placed into one of several categories. Collectively, ecosystem types assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable are called ‘threatened’. Collapsed is the ecosystem equivalent of the species category, Extinct.\n\nCollapsed (CO)\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nEndangered (EN)\nVulnerable (VU)\nNear Threatened (NT)\nLeast Concern (LC)\nNot Evaluated (NE)\nData deficient (DD)\n\nFor NBA 2025, the RLE framework was applied across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on ecosystem threat status, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal ecosystem threat status\nThe South African coast is proportionately more threatened than the rest of the country (entire non-coastal territory combined, Figure 2, Table 1). In fact, the coast (71% threatened ecosystem types) proportionately has three times more threatened ecosystem types than the rest of the country (22%), which is proportionately eight times more by extent (coastal: 46%, non-coastal: 6%). Areas where threatened ecosystem types are concentrated are around the Orange River mouth, through most of the Western Cape, in St Francis and Algoa bays, and along virtually the entire East Coast (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

This is because pressures on land act more locally and intensively than they do in the aquatic realms, often causing complete habitat loss (e.g., houses replacing grasslands) rather than degrees of degradation (e.g., different pollution levels in estuaries).\nBecause the data and/or assessment methodologies have changed in the realm assessments since the NBA 2018, the results are not comparable between the two assessments.

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem protection level is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. This indicator measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in South Africa’s protected area network, and has been used in national reporting since 2005.\nAfter comparing the extent extent of each ecosystem type under protection relative to its predefined biodiversity target (ranging 16-32%), with heuristics regarding the ecological condition within protected areas, ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories:\n\nWell Protected (WP): 100% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met (or exceeded) within the protected area network\nModerately Protected (MP): 50 - 99% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nPoorly Protected (PP): 5 - 49% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nNot Protected (NP): &lt;5% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\n\nFor NBA 2025, the ecosystem protection level indicator was calculated across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on the ecosystem protection level indicator, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal ecosystem protection level\nProportionately, the coast is slightly more protected than the rest of the land and sea (Figure 2, Table 1). This is positive given the myriad of benefits provided by coastal ecosystems and their disproportionately impacted and threatened status.\nAlthough 86% of coastal ecosystem types have some level of protection (163 of 190 types), only 19% are Well Protected, which accounts for 7% of the coastal extent (Figure 2, Table 1).\nThere is good progress in protecting coastal ecosystem types, but the national protected area network does need to be strengthened to afford protection to most of the coastal zone that is currently Poorly Protected or Not Protected (54% of types and 74% of extent), especially for coastal terrestrial and estuarine ecosystem types.\nIdeally, coastal ecosystem types should have cross-realm protection in contiguous land-based and marine protected areas. Good examples of cross-realm protection are: Garden Route National Park and Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area (MPA); iSimangaliso Wetland Park and MPA; De Hoop Nature Reserve and MPA; Addo Elephant National Park and MPA; and Namaqua National Park and MPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (A) number of types and (B) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal terrestrial ecosystem types are most Well Protected (22% of types, and 18% of extent); coastal marine ecosystem types have the largest percentage of ecosystem types in the top two categories, Well Protected and Moderately Protected (55% of types); and estuarine ecosystem types have the highest extent of protection across Well, Moderately and Poorly Protected (91% of extent) (Figure 2, Table 1).\nIn terms of Not Protected ecosystem types, the highest proportion of types is in the (coastal) terrestrial realm (20%), and the highest proportion of extent is in the (coastal) marine realm (31%) (Figure 2, Table 1).\n\nNumber of types Proportion of typesProportion of extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Overview\nSouth Africa’s southernmost territory, the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and the surrounding territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were included for the first time in the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018. The assessment of the PEIs marine ecosystem types found that 21% of ecosystem types are threatened by historical or current fishing, including one Endangered ecosystem type and five Vulnerable ecosystem types1. Marine mammals and birds species were assessed as part of the mainland Species Red List Assessments, since most of these also frequent South Africa’s mainland waters. There are 28 threatened or Near Threatened bird species breeding on the islands. Terrestrial ecosystem types are currently categorised as Data Deficient. The protection level assessment found that ten of the 29 marine ecosystems are Well Protected, 14 are Moderately Protected, one is Poorly Protected and four are Not Protected, whereas all terrestrial ecosystems are Well Protected. However, the efficacy of the protection of terrestrial ecosystems is compromised by biological invasions, particularly by the devastating impacts of the house mouse (Mus musculus)2, and climate change. While understanding of the PEIs’ species and ecosystems has developed substantially over the last few decades, there is considerable room for improving knowledge of ecological condition and species population trends, especially under accelerated climate change and increasing seabird deaths from mouse attacks. An ambitious conservation campaign, Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project, are planning an island-wide mouse eradication on Marion Island, that will assist in improving the ecological condition of the island once financial targets are met.

    "text": "Background\nThe PEIs are situated approximately 1 700 km southeast of the mainland and are comprised of Marion Island and the smaller Prince Edward Island (Figure 1). The subantarctic region has unique terrestrial and marine ecosystem types not found on the South African mainland or in its surrounding oceans. The PEIs support abundant marine and terrestrial biodiversity and are a critical breeding ground for seals and globally threatened seabirds. Decades of research conducted at the PEIs by a network of institutions have placed South Africa at the forefront of subantarctic and Antarctic science, and highlight the role of the PEIs as a natural laboratory for global change studies3. Including the PEIs in the NBA provides a valuable additional mechanism for regular reporting of past and current research at the islands, which could ultimately make an important contribution to the management and conservation of their unique biota by identifying and directing future research priorities. The terrestrial and marine biodiversity were assessed using IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) guidelines, and the first attempt at national assessment highlighted knowledge gaps and research priorities for the PEI research community to focus on moving forward. The previous 2018 ecosystem assessments are thus reported here1, as few ecosystems are endemic to the PEIs, requiring collaboration with and data on neighbouring subantarctic islands to conduct regional assessments.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystems at the Prince Edward Islands\nThe key input dataset for the terrestrial ecosystem assessment was the National Vegetation Map4. The digital map (Figure 2) delineates five vegetation types (equivalent to ecosystem types) within the PEIs that fall in either the Polar Desert Biome or Subantarctic Tundra Biome. It is fundamental that the assessment includes the entire distribution of ecosystem types. Therefore, since the terrestrial species and ecosystem types extend beyond South African borders to nearby subantarctic islands, a comprehensive global threat status assessment for these ecosystem types was not possible. \nThe first detailed map of the marine ecosystem types of the PEIs was produced as part of the NBA 2018 (Figure 2). The map was based on extensive research, consolidating historical and current information on regional biogeographic pattern, bathymetry and benthic ecosystems. The ecosystem types are therefore within regional ecosystems and some extend beyond national jurisdiction. The 29 marine ecosystem types are nested within nine functional groups and four ecoregions to represent marine biodiversity patterns. Increased investment in research has improved the PEIs’ marine ecosystem classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Ecosystem classification map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A, ecosystem types across the entire EEZ; B, terrestrial and shelf ecosystem types around the islands indicated by the box in panel A.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) are areas in the ocean that are characterised by their structural functionality and their vulnerability to bottom contact fishing gear. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) advanced the information for mapping of potential VMEs in the subantarctic territory since 2007 and this is the first map of relative density of VME indicator species in the PEIs (Figure 3). The map shows which ecosystem types are more sensitive to activities that may impact the seabed, including the Patagonian toothfish fishery that is the main offshore activity in the region at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. A map showing the known distribution and relative abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) based on CCAMLR data. Darker purple areas have more VME records and are likely to be more fragile ecosystem types that are sensitive to activities that may damage the seabed.",

    "title": "Summary of findings",
    "section": "Pressures",
    "text": "Pressures\nThe terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the PEIs are generally in more natural condition than the ecosystems on and around mainland South Africa. While the terrestrial ecosystems of the PEIs are free from the typical direct pressures of the mainland (e.g. land clearing for croplands, human settlements), they are subject to indirect biotic disruption by biological invasions and climate change. The taxonomically and functionally depauperate terrestrial ecosystems make them vulnerable to these biotic disruptions, because low biodiversity may lead to low ecosystem resilience. Unfortunately, spatial data on the impact and severity of climate change and invasive species are a key limitation to conducting threat assessments on these remote islands. A regional assessment will require additional ecosystem mapping efforts and condition data on nearby islands outside of South Africa’s territory. These pressures are the subject of ongoing research and in the near future regional assessments may be undertaken.  \n\nFishery for Patagonian toothfish\nThe only pressure affecting the marine environment of the PEIs that could be mapped with available data is the commercial Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery (Figure 4). Biodiversity concerns associated with the fishery include stock status concerns (as toothfish are slow growing), interactions with seabirds and marine mammals5, and potential impacts on the seabed particularly in Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. This highly valued resource has led to substantial illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing within the PEIs EEZ6. This experimental fishery was initiated in 1996 and was converted to a commercial fishery in 2006. Catches of toothfish during the legal experimental fishery were high with even higher illegal catches estimated in the mid-90s. Sanctions were then put in place to curb and monitor catches. Fishing effort data (total number of hooks set) was therefore available from 1997 and used to map fishing footprint until 2016 using a kernel density approach (95% value). Currently stock status and fishing pressure are considered optimal, with two rights holders currently in operation. Additionally, bycatch of seabirds has reduced from 0.19 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in 1996/1997 season, to 0.001 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in the 2001/2002 season in the legal fishery. However, poaching in the Southern Ocean remains a threat and the potential indirect impacts of intensive illegal fishing have not been studied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Patagonian toothfish fishery footprint in the exclusive economic zone of the Prince Edward Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien invasive species\nThe key biotic disruption to the terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa’s subantarctic territory is alien invasive species. These include 26 alien invertebrates, one alien vertebrate (the house mouse), and 18 alien plant species (many of which have become invasive). These species have severely impacted the ecology of the islands and caused alarming decreases in abundance of the indigenous biota. Three invasive plant species have caused major environmental impacts7, and are predicted to spread further on the islands with continued warming and drying. Sagina procumbens is one such invasive plant species, and has had the fastest rate of spread across the islands8 due to its wide ecological tolerance and ability to reproduce vegetatively and by seed9. Sagina procumbens increases the richness and abundance of invasive invertebrate species, indicating the interactive effect of invasive species. These terrestrial invasive species affect marine species that breed on the islands. Marine invasive species are also an emerging concern with some introduced marine taxa detected at other islands in the subantarctic region, but their impact at the PEIs is difficult to predict due to limited research in deep ecosystem types. Although the impact of many terrestrial and marine alien invasive species are an increasing concern, none have had a more profound effect than the house mouse (see Box 1). Eight alien plant species have been effectively controlled since 2012 and ongoing research is being conducted on these and other species to better understand their impacts and inform appropriate control measures7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Mice on Marion Island\n\n\n\n\n\nMice were accidentally introduced to Marion Island by sealers in the 1800s. Cats were brought to the island in an attempt to control the mice in 1949, but they were eradicated in 1991 because of their devastating impact on seabirds10. Without sufficient control mechanisms, the mice have become the key threat to the island, impacting terrestrial and marine species and severely disrupting the ecology of these sensitive island ecosystems. The rapid increase in the mice population is due to an interactive effect of the lack of natural control, alien plant and invertebrate species, and climate change2. Mice have impacted all trophic levels, initially depleting macroinvertebrate populations and seed stock and, more recently, predating on petrel and albatross chicks and eggs11,12. Alarmingly, since the first detection of mouse attacks on adult albatrosses was recorded in 202313, mouse wounds have spread rapidly on adults across the island14, with decreased breeding success of injured birds, and birds succumbing to the injuries. With 2.5 million pairs of seabirds breeding at the PEIs, they are particularly vulnerable to mammal invasions when aggregating in such vast numbers. Nineteen out of 29 birds species are at risk of becoming locally extinct if mice are not eradicated. This is in addition to the competition for resources and the direct impact of bycatch by fishing activity in their foraging areas. This highlights the urgent need for the planned mouse eradication.\n\n\n\n‘Scalping’ of a grey-headed albatross by mice. (© Tom Peschak)\n\n\nThe burrowing activity of mice also directly impacts indigenous plants, even causing mortality in a keystone species, Azorella selago15. This is an ecosystem engineer cushion plant species on the island, without which many of the island’s biota would not be able to survive in some of the harsher habitats on the island. Furthermore, the mice’s excessive predation on terrestrial invertebrates has caused a considerable decline in the invertebrate-feeding, endemic black-faced sheathbill (Chionis minor), the islands’ only terrestrial bird16. The impacts of mice also have knock-on ecosystem level effects, such as decreased decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of heavy predation on the invertebrates that are an integral component of decomposition at the island17– thereby affecting ecosystem functioning.\nThe Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project has committed to eradicating the mice in a collaborative effort led by BirdLife South Africa and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. Significant research effort has been directed to increase the probability of success of the largest island-wide eradication of rodents in the world, although financial constraints have impaired progress.

Since the mid-20th century, mean annual air and sea temperatures at the islands have increased by 1.2 and 1.4 °C, respectively – more than twice the mean global rate18– emphasising the islands’ global importance as ‘sentinels’ of climate change19.\nOn land, warmer air temperatures and more southerly winds have coincided with a considerable drying trend of the islands, with annual precipitation having decreased by 1 000 mm per year from the 1960s to 202020. This has directly impacted the ecology of many terrestrial taxa, which evolved under a cool and wet subantarctic climate. As a result, the island is following a similar greening trend to cold environments globally, where an increase in biomass has been associated with a change in climate20. Impacts on vegetation include range expansions of generalist native and invasive plant species20, especially to the now less waterlogged mires and to higher, cooler altitudes, as well as range contraction of more specialist plant species21, whose strong association to specific habitat conditions limits their ability to capitalise on the changing climatic conditions. Warmer and drier conditions have exacerbated the spread of alien invasive species and compounded their negative effect on native species, which is expected to worsen with continued warming and drying. Such fundamental changes in the terrestrial community have major implications for ecosystem structure and functioning at the PEIs.\nIn the marine environment, warmer waters and faster currents linked to the southward movement of the Subantarctic Front have become more common, reducing local productivity and changing the trophic structure and composition of benthic communities1. Decreased rainfall on land has reduced runoff of freshwater and nutrients into the sea, contributing to changes in local productivity and benthic ecosystems22. Epipelagic communities near the islands have changed in species composition, with Antarctic species decreasing and subtropical species becoming more common23. As the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts continue to migrate poleward, eddy generation at the South-West Indian Ridge is expected to decrease, reducing the advection of zooplankton and micronekton to the PEIs. These changes have implications for short- to medium-range predators such as Crozet shag, and gentoo, rockhopper, macaroni and king penguins – many of which have declined in recent decades.",

    "text": "Ecosystem Assessments\n\nEcosystem threat status (2018)\nA preliminary national threat status assessment, following the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework, was undertaken for the 29 marine ecosystem types (Figure 5). Criterion C1 (recent ecosystem degradation) was applied using the Patagonian toothfish fishery footprint. The extent of the fishing footprint was calculated for each ecosystem type, and the severity of the impact was estimated to be Moderate throughout. Ecosystems with 80% or more of their extent within the fishing footprint were categorised as Endangered, those with 50% or more were categorised as Vulnerable, and those with less were considered Least Concern. At this stage, the presence and abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems was not considered in the assessment of threat status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Distribution of threatened ecosystems in Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone. The 5 terrestrial ecosystems are listed as Data Deficient. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each IUCN RLE category.\n\n\n\nSix (21%) of the 29 marine ecosystem types described, are threatened by fishing (Figure 5). There are five Vulnerable ecosystem types including the PEI Shelf Edge, Upper Slope and Mid Slope, which were threatened by historical fishing within the 12 nm territorial Sea (now a sanctuary zone of the Marine Protected Area). More than 65 % of the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Seamount and Upper Spreading Ridge are fished, making them Vulnerable. Only one ecosystem type is considered Endangered, the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Spreading Ridge, which has been fished over its entire extent. The remaining marine ecosystem types have been fished over less than half of their extent and so are considered Least Concern at this stage (Figure 5). Climate risks need to be incorporated in future assessments which also adopt a regional rather than a national approach.\nThe ecosystem threat status assessment for the five terrestrial PEI ecosystems was hampered by the lack of appropriate data on ecological condition and were thus assessed as being Data Deficient. These are national assessments and comprehensive regional or global assessment should remain the goal for these ecosystem types in future. This highlights the opportunity for co-operation with international partners to determine the distribution and condition of the PEIs’ ecosystem types beyond South Africa’s boundaries. It is possible that when the global situation is considered, some ecosystem types currently assessed as Least Concern or Data Deficient in the PEIs may change to threatened. \nWith biological invasion and climate change being the key threats to the PEIs, disruption of biological processes and ecosystem degradation is an increasing concern. There is a gap in our ability to understand thresholds of condition and there are challenges in measuring the subtler forms of habitat degradation in such remote regions. As a result, the level of modification of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, particularly the impact of demersal fishing on potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, may be under estimated. Better information on biotic disruptions (especially by mice, invasive plants and invertebrates) and environmental degradation (climate change and human impacts) are required for a meaningful assessment.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level (2018)\nEcosystem protection level is an indicator that tracks how well represented an ecosystem type is in the protected area network. For the PEIs, ecosystem protection level was computed by determining the proportion of each ecosystem type that falls within the protected area network. No ecosystem specific biodiversity targets have been set for PEIs ecosystems types and a fixed target of 20% was used. The categories for protection level are: Well Protected where the extent protected exceeds the biodiversity target; Moderately Protected where the extent protected is between 50 and 99% of the target; Poorly Protected where the extent protected is between 5 and 49% of the target; and Not Protected where the extent protected is less than 5% of the target. In order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category at least 20% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem protection target) needed to be within the portion of MPA in which no fishing is permitted (12 nm sanctuary and restricted zone AB); if this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nOverall, 86% of marine ecosystem types are afforded some protection by the MPA network (Figure 6). Ten marine ecosystem types are Well Protected (35%), 14 are Moderately Protected (48%), one is Poorly Protected (4%) and four are Not Protected (14%). All five terrestrial ecosystem types were categorised as Well Protected (Figure 6). As with the ecosystem threat status assessment, these are preliminary results that do not yet consider the regional or global extent of ecosystem types and better data on ecological condition could also affect future protection level assessments.\nTerrestrial ecosystems were declared a Special Nature Reserve in 1995, in terms of the Environment Conservation Act (No. 73 of 1989) and thus enjoy the highest level of protection afforded to any natural area under South African law. The PEI MPA is South Africa’s largest protected area across realms (169 966 km2 or 36% of the PEIs EEZ) and has a core sanctuary zone around the islands and one restricted zone (zone AB) in which no fishing is permitted (together making up 6% of the EEZ). There are a further three restricted zones in which fishing is limited (8% of EEZ), and a large controlled zone that accommodates the commercial Patagonian toothfish fishery (22% of the EEZ). Where fishing overlaps with Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VMEs) and threatened ecosystem types, additional measures are needed to protect these ecosystems (e.g. the Southwest Indian Ridge in the northern portion of the EEZ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Ecosystem protection level map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone. Terrestrial ecosystems, represented in white, are all Well Protected. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each protection level category.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the marine environment of the PEIs has been heavily exploited by the commercial longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish, the spawning biomass of which may only be a fraction of what is was pre-exploitation in the early 1990s. The establishment of the MPA was intended to contribute to the recovery of toothfish populations, as well as provide protection for vulnerable and unique species and habitats. The zonation of fishing activity needs to be re-examined and fishing effort needs to be reduced in restricted zones to improve protection of marine ecosystem types.",

    "text": "Understading key estuary pressure\nA brief summary of pressures is provided here with a description of each pressure, detailed the relative intensity of each pressure, summarised patterns in the extent and intensity of pressures, summarise biodiversity impacts of each pressure, and noting mitigation measures1,2.\nKey pressure categories include2:\n\nFreshwater flow modification impacts estuarine productivity and ecological functioning, affecting estuarine circulation and retention. It also impacts water chemistry (e.g., salinity, dissolved oxygen), sediment processes, and land-sea connectivity. In extreme cases, it can lead to type changes, causing closure of estuaries previously categorised as permanently open3. Associated biological impacts include degradation of habitats such as intertidal mudflats, salt marsh, and mangroves. Changes in connectivity can impact life-cycle requirements of migrating species, and genetic exchange between estuaries and adjacent marine environment.\nLand-use and development refer to land-use such as agriculture, as well as hard infrastructure development such as harbours and ports. Direct effects include loss of abiotic and biotic habitat, changes in circulation patterns, disruption of erosion/depositional cycles, modified tidal regimes, premature mouth closure, water clarity, and declining primary productivity. Ultimately, habitat changes have cascading impacts on biota, affecting population size/biomass, community composition, and possible local extinctions. Habitat loss also reduces carrying capacity of estuaries, especially for higher trophic level species.\nInlet manipulations are driven by the need to enhance land-sea connectivity. Artificial breaching is the most prevalent activity in this category and isimplemented to alleviate back-flooding of poorly planned low-lying developments or agricultural land when the mouth closes4;3. Reduced freshwater flow often results in increased inlet closure, higher sand bar levels, and increased flooding of surrounding environs (Stein et al., 2021). Closed conditions are associated with nuisance algae or macrophyte blooms in nutrient-enriched systems, with premature artificial breaching promoted as a mitigation measure. Premature breaching can alter seasonality in land-sea connectivity, while breaching at too low levels reduces scouring of accumulated sediment and organic matter, resulting in constrained tidal flows and shorter open periods. Inlet manipulation changes key hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes with cascading effects on primary productivity, species composition, and recruitment of larval fish and invertebrates4. Inlet manipulation may also induce estuary type changes, e.g., changing temporarily open systems to permanently open systems (van Niekerk et al., 2020).\nPollution, specifically nutrient enrichment, results in excessive primary production and associated secondary impacts such as hypoxia (low oxgen) and loss of associated ecosystem services1. Eutrophication results in loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, oxygen depletion, harmful algae blooms, imbalanced food webs, lower biodiversity, altered biogeochemical cycling, and fish kills. Pollution can change an estuary from a macrophyte-dominated to a phytoplankton- or macroalgae-dominated system. Toxic substances, such as trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (e.g., herbicides and pesticides), also pose significant ecological and human health risks.\nEstuaries function as nurseries and provide vital habitat for commercially important estuary-associated marine fish and invertebrates species5. Fishing impact population size, biomass, sex-ratios, size/age distribution, community composition, trophic structure, and reproductive capacity. Depletion-driven declines in effective population size may also drive hybridization. Vulnerable life-history characteristics, e.g., estuary-dependence, ‘natal homing’ and predictable aggregations are amplified by anthropogenic pressures such as fishing, pollution, and flow modification, ultimately leading to recruitment failure or even extirpation.\nBiological invasions by invasive alien species pose an ever-increasing threat to estuaries causing ecological and economic damage. Alien species can alter abiotic and biotic habitats, change sediment/water pathways, nutrient/biogeochemical cycling, impact community structure and functions by modifying spatial and food chain resources, with direct or indirect effects on indigenous species. Economic concerns include reduced food sources, burrowing activities destabilising embankments, clogging of desalination/cooling water plants, and predation of commercially important species. Habitat degradation reduces overall estuary ecosystem resilience to alien invasive species such as invasive North American cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and Asian mollusc Tarebia granifera6.\n\n\nFresh water flow modification\nMore than a third of freshwater flows to estuaries is now abstracted (36 900 to 24 800 x 106 m3/a). The most significant reduction occurs in the Cool Temperate region, mainly due to reduce flow to the Orange Estuary, which drains more than 60% of the surface area of South Africa. Followed by the Warm Temperate region, while losses in the wetter Subtropical region are less. Arid predominantly closed systems are most severely impacted by flow modification. These estuary types have a high sensitivity to flow modification, as they are in hot, arid environments subjected to high evaporation rates. Estuarine types supported by relatively large catchments, such as Large fluvially dominated, Predominantly open, and Large temporarily closed systems, also experience high to very high flow modification pressures.\nActivities that contribute significantly to flow modification include: run-of-river abstraction, dam development, alien vegetation infestation, return flows (e.g., wastewater and agriculture), groundwater abstraction, transfer schemes, hydroelectric schemes, and increased runoff from hardened catchment surfaces (e.g., urban development)2. Of these, run-of-river freshwater abstraction, dams and weirs, and alien vegetation infestation are mainly responsible for decreasing inflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of freshwater flow modification by estuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMitigation of flow modification pressure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe management and mitigation of flow modification is primarily done through legislative interventions obligating the allocation of environmental flows to rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine environment within an integrated water resources management framework7,8. In South Africa all activities that impact streamflow should be regulated through the Water Resources Classification process, including groundwater abstraction, forestation, and return flow. Classification should strive to find a balance between ecological, social and economic needs ensuring that adequate flows are allocated to estuaries of high conservation and/or societal value to ensure their long-term sustainability and associated benefits.\nFurther, investment in effective compliance monitoring and regular auditing of water resource use, as well as long-term resource monitoring needs to be undertaken to inform streamflow management strategies and country-level trend indicators (e.g., State of the Environment, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Global Biodiversisty Framework (GBF) targets, conservation targets). Effective implementation of water resource management should also be supported by the development and implemetation of agriculture and forestry best practice guidelines, e.g., instituting buffer zones, manage return flow.\nActivities that increase stream flow, e.g., wastewater inputs, are managed through permitting legislation (e.g. National Water Act and Integrated Coastal Management Act), while increase flow from hardened catchments and/or urban stormwater should be managed using innovative technologies such as Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), artificial wetlands and ‘softening’ of catchments1.\nMuch uncertainty exists regarding climate change impacts on streamflow, and research is urgently needed to downscale Global Climate models outputs for application in standard hydrological models and to reflect impact of extreme events (floods and droughts). Finally, investment should be made in in remote sensing technologies in support of estuarine hydrographic and hydrologic data collection and in automation of data integration into simulation modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nPollution\nExcept for the Tropical region, substantial areas across all biogeographic regions experience severe pollution pressures, with the Cool Temperate and Subtropical regions the most effected. Most severely affected functional groups are the Large fluvially dominated systems, Predominantly open and Estuarine bays. Only Estuarine lagoons and Small fluvially dominated systems still experience low pollution pressure.\nWastewater discharges to estuaries totalling 655 000 m3/day. These are mostly from municipal WWTWs, with the highest volumes disposed of in the urban centres of Cape Town (Cool Temperate region) and Durban (Subtropical region). The only significant industrial discharge are from fish processing is in the Cool Temperate region. Diffuse urban runoff (stormwater) is a major source of pollution in rapidly growing urban areas, where informal settlements are often not connected to sewage reticulation systems. Municipalities often do not have resources or skills to repair or upgrade deteriorating infrastructure. As a result, WWTWs are often overloaded or malfunctioning causing spillage. Agricultural return flows are also cause marked water quality deterioration in estuaries (e.g., Sundays, Gamtoos estuaries). Solid waste (e.g., litter and single-use plastics) is an emerging concern in especially from urban areas and informal settlements. Most of these activities are on an increasing trajectory.\nKey activities contribute to pollution pressure include wastewater discharges (municipal and industrial), urban stormwater runoff, agricultural return flow, solid waste (e.g., litter and plastics), and shipping activities (e.g., oil spills). Of these wastewater discharges, urban runoff, and agricultural return flows are the most significant. Rapid coastal development generates greater demand for WWTW facilities (1,2). Although most coastal municipalities have sewage reticulation systems that comply with permitted effluent concentration standards, effluent volumes are often higher than the assimilative capacity of receiving estuaries1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1: Harmful algal blooms in estuaries\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmful algal blooms (HABs) are now recorded in 18% of South African estuaries in response to declining water quality. HABs are increasingly impacting the ecological integrity of South African estuaries, with bloom are predominantly concentrated along the Warm Temperate coastline (23 estuaries) and less frequent in Cold Temperate (n = 13) and Subtropical/Tropical (n = 15) regions. Some of the most common HAB impacts include hypoxia, reduced biodiversity, altered food webs, and mass faunal mortalities. The upward trajectory of HAB frequency and magnitude is strongly linked to increased anthropogenic nutrient loading, predominantly stemming from municipal wastewater, urban stormwater, and agricultural sources.\nThe microtidal and low-inflow nature of South African estuaries increases their susceptibility to HAB accumulations. Extensive blooms (Chl-a &gt; 60 µg/L) were prevalent at least 27 estuaries, with Large Temporarily Closed estuary types showing the highest incidence. Concerning examples of HAB species documented in South African estuaries include the toxic Heterosigma akashiwo and Prymnesium parvum.\nAs global change pressures continue to intensify, targeted monitoring, interdisciplinary research, and integrated catchment-to-coast management interventions are required to mitigate the cascading impacts of HABs on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Most important is the management and reduction of pollution pressure (nutrients from WWTW, stormwater and agricultural return flow).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMitigation of pollution pressure\n\n\n\n\n\nPollution from WWTW should be better controlled through permitting and supported by water quality monitoring programmes. Urban stormwater management require forward thinking technologies such as SUDS, artificial wetlands, and the overall ‘softening’ of the catchments.\nAgricultural best practice guidelines should promote wise use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; supported by market-driven incentives to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. Solid waste also should be addressed through permitting, supported by strategies to reduce plastics in the environment. Regulations to prevent and minimising pollution from ships’ operations or accidental causes should be better enforced and strengthened, where necessary.\nThe growing impacts of pharmaceuticals on estuarine biota and food resources, as well as impacts of plastic, light, and noise pollution urgently require research attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFishing\nEstuaries under sever fishing pressure have in crease from 15% to 21% to 28% between 2011, 2018 and 2025 (75% to78% to 85% area) severely comprising the multiple benefits derive from estuaries. Availability of cheap gillnets online (e.g. Temo, Takelot, Shein) have led to exponential increase in estuary fishing pressure. Estuaries, especially in KZN and Wild Coast, under severe pressure from illegal gillnetting. Fishing pressure is largely focussed on the larger types. For example, 100% of Estuarine lagoons and Estuarine bays are under severe pressure followed by Predominantly open, Estuarine lakes, and Large fluvially dominated systems. Most smaller estuary types, experience low to no fishing pressure.\nGillnetting is a indiscriminate fishing method that catches juvenile fish, macro invertebrates(crabs and prawns), birds, turtles and terrapins, water monitors and crocodiles. In response authorities launched DFFE Gillnet Reporting App hosted by OCIMS to monitor illegal catches and established a well co-ordinate compliance network in KZN. An example of success, is that in 2025 80% of nets are retrieved before they catch anything and for every 39 fish caught per illegal net retrieved 21 is released alive. Catches peaked in 2023/24.Compliance initiatives needs to be supported by community education and awareness, increase customs control (to stop imports), and collaboration with on-line retailers to foster self-regulation. The retailer Macro is example of self-regulation as they removed nets form stock once the company became aware of the cascading impacts on estuarine and coastal ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Map of fishing effort by estuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMitigation of fishing pressure\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure sustainable fishing, the exploitation of living resources should be controlled through appropriate catch/gear control measures (e.g., catch limits, size/slot limits), closed periods (spawning seasons, night ban on fishing), supported by investment in more effective compliance and enforcement, e.g., remote tracking systems, human resources, and estuarine resource monitoring programmes.\nBiodiversity protection and stock recovery should be enhanced through increasing formal protection measures, e.g., Marine Protected Areas, closed area zonation and IUCN Red Listing of species, supported by restoration of critical nurseries.\nPublic awareness on the risk of over-exploitation and/or destructive fishing practices pose to estuary function and long-term societal benefits should be increased.\nWhile fisheries management is a growing field, little is being done to predict, and manage impacts of cumulative pressures on estuarine fish resources, highlighting the need for research and development of such integrated approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nLand-use change and infrastructure development\nThe Warm and Cool Temperate regions are most affected, followed by the Subtropical region. Overall, agriculture is responsible for the most land cover transformation, while urban development contributes to a lesser degree. Land-use and development pressures are high to very high across most estuarine types, with Large fluvially dominated, Arid predominantly closed, Predominantly open, Large temporarily closed; Estuarine bays, and Estuarine lakes, and Small temporarily closed systems all under severe pressure. Only Estuarine lagoons and Small fluvially dominated systems experience low pressure, as these are well represented in protected areas.\nLand-use and infrastructure development pressures are associated with activities in the EFZ: urban infrastructure (housing, resorts), transport infrastructure (roads, crossings, and culverts), riparian infrastructure (fences, bank stabilisation and low-lying developments), agriculture (crops, grazing), in-stream infrastructure (jetties and launch sites), forestry, mining, port, harbour and marina infrastructure, raw material harvesting for building (reeds, sedges and mangroves) and saltworks.\nUrban development, agriculture, and transport infrastructure are responsible for most impacts, and to a lesser extent riparian and instream infrastructure and mining. Agriculture in the Cool and Warm Temperate regions mainly comprise croplands and grazing, while industrial-scale sugarcane farming dominates the Subtropical region. Burning reeds to improve grazing is a common practice in most regions. Road and railway bridges across estuaries impact sediment processes and the meandering nature of estuary inlets. Although the full extent of transport infrastructure could not be quantified, it is prevalent in all biogeographic regions. The Subtropical region is most affected by poorly planned road and railway infrastructure crossing 48 of 50 estuaries along a 150 km stretch in this region (Begg, 1978; van Niekerk et al., 2013). Commercial ports are located in five estuaries (Cool Temperate (1), Warm Temperate (2), Subtropical (2)), while fishing/yacht harbours and marinas occur in seven estuaries (Cool Temperate (3), Warm Temperate (2), Subtropical regions (2)).\nAlthough mining activities may have a relatively small footprint, the marked increase in mining (and associated irreversible destruction of estuarine habitat) is a growing concern. Mining activities in the Cool and Warm Temperate regions comprise diamond, heavy minerals, and sand mining, and affect 3% and 1% of extent, respectively. Heavy mineral and sand mining are the dominant mining activities in the Subtropical region, with the latter having increased markedly in the past decade, with 71 sand mining operations located within 19 estuaries (affecting 358 ha of estuarine habitat) (GeoTerraImage, 2015; ORI unpublished data). Mining is an intense pressure, with long-term direct and indirect impacts on species and ecosystems. Its direct footprint involves clearing of natural habitat which is captured in land cover change. However, the indirect impacts of mining relating to water abstraction and contamination are not explicitly reflected in these datasets.\nOther activities associated with land-use and development, include estuarine vegetation harvested (e.g., reeds, sedges, and mangroves) for housing, the construction of cattle enclosures and fish traps in rural areas. Salt works are confined to a few systems in the more arid parts of the Cool (3) and Warm (2) Temperate regions.\nMost land-use and development activities, and their associated impact on estuaries, are on an increasing trajectory. Although commercial port infrastructure is considered stable and limited to only a few estuaries, small fishing and yacht harbours, as well as marina developments, are set to increase under a greater ‘blue economy’ development push.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMitigation of Land-use change and infrastructure development pressures\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical in mitigating Land-use and development impacts is the protection of ‘estuary space’ by spatially delineating and legally defining the estuary functional zone that encompass all critical habitats.\nLegislation supporting cross-sectorial management, e.g., development of estuarine management plans needs to be strengthened, while strategic environmental impact (SEA) and environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes should be legally enforced for any development within estuary functional zone.\nLegislation should be strengthened to prohibit extractive exploitation of non-living estuarine resources (e.g., mining) as they severely compromise estuary productivity and societal benefits over longer time-scales.\nManagement interventions to protect ecologically/socially important estuaries should be prioritised, e.g., formally protected areas, Ramsar sites, Important Bird Areas, Critical Biodiversity Areas, IUCN Red Listing of Ecosystems (Van Niekerk et al., 2019b).\nA national restoration programme should be instituted to reinstate productivity/functionality in severely degraded, high-value systems. This includes investment in fine-scale mapping of historical and present land-use trends at landscape scales, and the development of remote sensing and planning technologies, as such knowledge are becoming essential in approaches to predict and manage change in estuaries at regional scales.\n\n\n\n\n\nMouth manipulations\nMouth manipulations are aimed at increasing land-sea connectivity and refers to artificial breaching, stabilisation, or canalisation, and diversion of mouths (2). Due to inappropriate coastal development, estuary mouths are manipulated to prevent property damage and/or ensure access. Artificial breaching to prevent back-flooding under closed mouth conditions is the most common activity. A small number of mouths are stabilised for navigation, while inlet diversion and/or stabilisation occur in urban areas.\nApproximately 15% of estuaries are artificially manipulated, but disproportionally represent more than 60% of extent. While it occurs in all biogeographic regions, it is most often associated with urban centres of Cape Town, Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and Durban. Estuarine lakes are most at risk from mouth manipulation, with most lakes under pressure, followed by Large fluvially dominated, and Large temporarily closed.\nIn South Africa, mouth manipulation stems from a policy gap where boundaries of properties are still determined by the ‘high water mark’ when an estuary is open, not accounting for back-flooding during closed conditions which serve as critical habitat. Consequently, inappropriate low-lying developments (i.e., inundated under natural breaching levels) are being protected at the cost of natural estuarine processes. Inlet manipulation is on an increasing trajectory. Further, there isa tendency to artificially breach systems well below natural breaching levels, causing increased sedimentation, reduced tidal flows, premature closures, and subsequent increase in long-term flood risk.",

    "text": "Approach\nTo estimate degree of pressure associated with flow modification, land-use and development, inlet manipulation, and pollution, ratings of related indicators in South Africa’s Estuarine Health Index (EHI) were applied (Turpie et al., 2012). The EHI considers both abiotic (hydrology, hydrodynamics and mouth condition, water chemistry, physical habitat) and biotic (microalgae, macrophytes, invertebrates, fish, and birds) indicators.\nEstuarine health is rated as similarity to natural (rated as 100) with pressure ratings correspond to: Low = &gt;75% similar to natural (Categories A - B), Medium = 75 - 60 % (Category C), High = 60 – 40 % (Category D) and Very high = &lt; 40% (Categories E - F).\nFor flow modification, the hydrological indicator, changes in low flow (60% of indicator rating) and floods (40% of indicator rating), or percentage reduction in mean annual runoff from natural, were used. For land-use and development, changes in physical habitat indicator were used to estimate degree of pressure.\nThe degree of pressure associated with inlet manipulation was derived from the hydrodynamic indicator, specifically similarity in inlet status. For pollution, a sub-indicator of water quality (scoring similarity in dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients and toxic substances) was applied.\nThe degree of exploitation of living resources (largely focused on fishing), was derived from a combination of the fish indicator rating, moderated by the nature and magnitude of fishing effort (e.g., number of fishers, traps, gillnets versus fishing rods and handlines); catch composition; and size/age distributions of fish in sample data sets. ‘Very high’ pressure was associated with gillnetting or fish traps. ‘High’ and ‘Medium’ indicated relative levels of recreational and/or subsistence exploitation. ‘Low’ indicated little fishing pressure, however, all estuaries reflect some impact of adjacent beaches and nearshore over-fishing. A few systems where no fish are found (e.g., hypersaline estuaries) were rated as ‘None’.\nTo assess the degree of pressure from alien invasive plants, data from various national databases were used and categorised into aquatic and terrestrial plants. Their presence was recorded across different reaches (i.e., lower, middle, and upper estuary), while the degree of pressure was estimated on a three-tier scale relative to percentage coverage of EFZ area: Low = alien coverage &lt;5%; Medium = alien coverage 5-15% and High = alien coverage &gt;15%. Data on microalgal and macroalgal blooms were also assessed using similar method.\nTo evaluate pressure from alien or extralimital (translocated) fish species-level information was used from2. In addition, unpublished freshwater fish species data and field observations were considered (2). A species list per estuary was compiled and fish grouped into to (1) egg and larvae eaters (Bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, Mosquito fish Gambusia affinis, Guppy Poecilia reticulata), (2) habitat altering species (Carp Cyprinus carpio, Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella) and (3) predatory species (Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, Spotted bass Micropterus punctulatus, Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus). Pressure rating for alien or extralimital fish were derived from the number and type of fish species present in individual estuaries, being Low = 1-2 species, Medium = 3-4 species, High = 5-6 species or 1-2 predatory species or Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus present (if translocated/ extralimital) or Very High = &gt;7 species or 3- 4 predatory species.",

Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.\nMultiple interventions are required to avoid further decline in health. These include protection of freshwater inflow to estuaries and the sea, restoration of water quality, reduction in fishing effort and avoidance of mining, infrastructure development and crops in the estuarine functional zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.\nThe IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:\n\nCriterion A2b (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.\nCriterion A3 (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022\nCriterion B3 was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by &gt;1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D1 was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D3 was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of &gt;= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity &gt;=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity &gt;=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\nEach of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.\nA more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at RLE explanation page.",

    "text": "Summary\nEstuary ecosystem types can serve as surrogates for ecosystem processes and enable predictions of biophysical characteristics. Understanding ecological processes and patterns associated with an estuary type facilitates an assessment of its resilience to anthropogenic pressures. This allows for extrapolation in data-limited environments Figure 1.\nThe estuarine classification scheme divided the biogeographical regions that characterise the South African coast into four major zones: the Cool Temperate (Orange to Ratel), the Warm Temperate (Heuningnes to Mendwana), the Subtropical (Mbashe to St Lucia) and the Tropical (uMgobezeleni to Kosi), with the latter being a new addition to the estuarine biogeographical provinces.\nAll rivers or streams with outlets to the sea were categorised broadly as estuaries and micro-systems. South Africa’s 290 estuaries are categorised into nine functional types, namely Estuarine lake, Estuarine bay, Estuarine lagoon (e.g. the groundwater-fed Langebaan system), Predominantly open, Large and Small temporarily closed, Large and Small fluvially dominated, and Arid predominantly closed. Micro-systems were further divided into micro-estuaries (42), micro-outlets, and coastal waterfalls based on spatial features and biotic observations in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Biographical regions\nThe traditional biogeographic organisation of South African estuaries has included only three dominant regions, viz. subtropical, warm-temperate and cool-temperate (Emanuel et al. 1992; Harrison 2002; Turpie et al. 2000). However, the tropical distribution of some species recorded in the Kosi and uMgobezeleni estuaries in the north, prompted subdividing the subtropical region and include a tropical transition zone in the north-east of South Africa. Both of these systems, albeit differing in size and function, are unique clear water estuaries on a small section of South African coast.\nKosi Estuary has uniquely tropical flora indicated by presence of the seagrass (Halodule universis) and mangrove species Lumnitzera racemosa, Ceriops tagal and Xylocarpus granatum that are found in no other South African systems (Van Niekerk et al 2020). Tropical species such as the Snake Sea Cucumber (Synapta maculate) and Pen Shell (Pinna muricata) (associated with H. universis) also point to a tropical influence on the system’s invertebrate fauna. The ichthyofaunal comprises a wide diversity of fishes, including tropical species not reported from any other South African estuaries (Blaber & Cyrus 1981). This is evidenced by the abundance and large sizes of several members of the Lutjanidae (snappers) in the system.\nTo the south, St Lucia Estuary supports invertebrate communities common in subtropical estuaries (MacKay et al. 2010). The Tropical zone aligns with marine biogeographic patterns evident for marine biogeographic map that includes the Natal-Delagoa tropical region (Sink et al. 2019).\nThus, the Estuarine Ecosystem Classification scheme defined the biogeographical regions as:\n\nCool-temperate from Orange Estuary on the Northern Cape to Uilkraals Estuary in the Western Cape;\nWarm-temperate from the Ratel Estuary near Cape Agulhas to Mendwana Estuary in the Eastern Cape;\nSubtropical stretches from the Mbashe Estuary in the Eastern Cape to the St Lucia Estuary in KwaZulu-Natal; and\nTropical from uMgobezeleni to Kosi Estuary in Northen KwaZulu-Natal.",

    "section": "What is an estuary?",
    "text": "What is an estuary?\nThe NBA 2025 defines an estuary as ‘a partially enclosed permanent water body, either continuously or periodically open to the sea on decadal time scales, extending as far as the upper limit of tidal action, salinity penetration or back-flooding under closed mouth conditions. During floods an estuary can become a river mouth with no seawater entering the formerly estuarine area or, when there is little or no fluvial input, an estuary can be isolated from the sea by a sandbar and become fresh or even hypersaline’ (Van Niekerk et al. 2020). A defining feature of this definition is that complex estuarine abiotic processes distinguish estuaries from other aquatic ecosystem types i.e. restricted tidal action, mixing of fresh and salt water, increased retention and/or increased water levels under closed mouth conditions.",

    "text": "Estuary functional types\nSouth Africa’s 290 estuaries are categorised into nine functional types, namely Estuarine lake, Estuarine bay, Estuarine lagoons (e.g. the groundwater-fed Langebaan system), Predominantly open, Large and Small temporarily closed, Large and Small fluvially dominated, and Arid predominantly closed Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Examples of South African estuary types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstuarine lakes\nEstuarine lakes comprise one or more typically large circular water bodies connected to the sea by a constricted inlet channel. Maximum water levels are determined by berm height, mouth state and freshwater input. Marine connectivity varies from almost permanently open to closed on annual scales. Salinities are highly variable, ranging from fresh to hypersaline because of differing freshwater input (surface and ground water), evaporation and the extent of the marine connection. Mixing processes are dominated by wind and, to a lesser extent fluvial inputs, owing to their restricted mouths and relatively large surface areas. Average tidal amplitudes are negligible (15 – 20 cm) when connected to the sea, primarily due to restricted mouth conditions. Sediment processes tend to be stable, with infilling occurring over long time scales and resetting confined to larger flood events.\n\n\nEstuarine bays\nEstuarine bays are permanently linked to the sea by unrestricted, deep mouths and are dominated by tidal processes, with tidal amplitudes close to those of the sea. These are large systems (&gt;1200 ha) with generally round basins where only the upper reaches experience a degree of constriction to tidal flows. As a result of relatively low river inputs they have a predominantly euhaline salinity regime in the lower and mid reaches, with freshwater mixing processes being mostly confined to the restricted upper areas. Sediments are typically marine in origin and grain size distributions are stable. There are two natural occurrences of Estuarine bays in South Africa (viz. Knysna and Durban Bay.\n\n\nEstuarine lagoons\nLangebaan Lagoon has many of the characteristics of an estuary (Whitfield 2005), including calm waters that are protected from marine wave action and biota that reflect many of the species usually found in estuaries. However, despite groundwater seeps into some areas, it lacks surface water inflow and a normal estuarine salinity gradient. Langebaan Lagoon represents a unique coastal ecosystem type and is recognised as an estuary because its ecological functioning includes both freshwater and marine inputs into a semi-enclosed embayment. Estuarine lagoons, as defined here, are permanently connected to the sea and are therefore marine dominated. Tidal action is the dominant mixing process and sedimentary processes are thus generally stable. Tidal amplitude and water levels are close to those of the sea.\n\n\nPredominantly open estuaries\nThese estuaries are open to the sea for more than 90% of the time. Some are permanently open owing to perennial river flows or the presence of large tidal prisms. Tidal amplitude ranges from 0.75-1.5 m. Predominantly Open estuaries are linear systems in which mixing processes are dominated by both fluvial inputs and tidal action creating vertical and horizontal salinity gradients. Under low flows, hypersalinity can develop in the upper reaches. The degree to which the mouth is restricted depends on the rate and volume of freshwater inflow. Some systems become severely constricted during low flow periods. Regular flooding results in relatively mobile sediments. These estuaries usually support wetlands, salt marshes, macrophyte beds and marine and estuarine fauna. Surprisingly, their size varies considerably ranging from 10 to 7500ha, with smaller systems afforded a degree of protection against direct wave action by rocky headlands or subtidal reefs, which assists in maintaining an open mouth.\n\n\nLarge and small temporarily closed estuaries\nThe sizable temporarily open/closed category of Whitfield (1992) was divided into Small and Large temporarily closed estuaries using a total habitat area of 15ha (associated with ~10ha of open water area) as the dividing threshold. The division was based on differences in biophysical processes and patterns. Small systems are likely to experience rapid increases and decreases freshwater runoff over a few hours making them strongly event driven. There will be little scouring during breachings, and a semi-closed mouth condition can easily develop owing to a small, perched, outflow channel that restricts tidal amplitude to 10 to 15cm. There is minimal water column area during the open state. Habitat diversity is likely to be low (and without intertidal salt marshes) and species diversity and abundance reduced.\nBoth large and small systems tend to be linear or funnel shaped with highly restricted inlets. Smaller systems especially tend to be ‘perched’ above normal tidal levels, resulting in little to no open water area during the open mouth low tide state. Water levels are dominated by the state of the mouth, with highest levels of 1 m to 2 m above mean sea level during the closed phase. Tidal ranges are very restricted, varying from 25-50 cm in Large temporarily closed estuaries to 15-30 cm in Small temporarily closed estuaries. Open phase mixing processes are dominated by fluvial input and partially by tides. When closed, wind and seepage losses through the berm play a key role. Sediment composition is largely stable, resetting mainly during floods. Salinity regimes range from almost fresh to hypersaline, which in large systems can develop during times of low flow or droughts. Small temporarily closed estuaries tend to be fresher in character as they have less connectivity with the sea.\n\n\nSmall and large fluvially dominated estuaries\nSmall and Large fluvially dominated systems to distinguish between small (&lt;15 ha), black water dominated, rocky temperate southern coast estuaries, and large, shallow, sediment rich, freshwater dominated systems of the east and west coasts. The larger systems have very high sediment turnover, often develop ebb-tidal deltas, are turbid and can close during periods of low flow, e.g. uThukela and Orange estuaries. Small, sediment-starved, fluvially-dominated systems have unrestricted mouths as they usually occur along rocky shores and receive clear humic-stained water from Table Mountain Sandstone catchments. Large fluvially dominated estuaries tend to be constricted and can even periodically close during low flows. River processes are dominant and salinities are mostly fresh throughout the estuary for more than half the time. During peak flood conditions, outflows can influence salinities for considerable distances offshore.\n\n\nArid predominantly closed estuaries\nThis type comprises six small estuaries (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord) and Wadrift) located in the arid Namaqua west coast region. They are linear or funnel shaped and closed on annual to decadal scales. Salinities tend to be high to hypersaline (&gt;35) as a result of low fluvial input and high evaporation rates. Thus, mixing processes tend to occur over long time periods and are dominated by the effects of evaporation, winds and seepage. Occasional breaching and over-washing during high sea conditions provide for marine connectivity. Sediment processes are generally stable on decadal time scales and are reset by large intermittent flash floods. Water levels are determined by the interplay between sand berm level, evaporation rates and seepage losses. Groundwater and inflows from local fountains replenish these losses and influence the salinity regimes of these estuaries.\nArid conditions promote the growth of unique vegetation such as salt tolerant, succulent Sarcocornia spp. and Salicornia spp. thatcan flourish despite open water salinities reaching above 200. Fish relies on ‘suicidal’ recruitment that is largely a function of connectivity with the sea and overwash during high seas. Fish survival depends on groundwater maintaining salinity gradients and hypersalinity not exceeding 40 in parts of the systems. Invertebrate diversity, abundance and community structure are related to changing salinity gradients including long cycles of hypersalinity, e.g. Shrimp Artemia sp. that hatch at salinities above 40 and encyst when salinities exceed 150. Cycles of Artemia abundance follow salinity regimes that in turn affect the diversity, abundance and occurrence of flamingos and other birds that feed on them.",

    "text": "Estuarine ecosystem types in South Africa\nThe Estuarine Ecosystem Classification system for South Africa’s 290 estuaries are derived from interplay between biogeographical regions and estuary functional types, stemming from the country’s diverse climatic, oceanographic and geological drivers.\nEstuarine lagoons are the rarest South African estuary type with only one member in the Cool Temperate region, followed by Estuarine bays with two in the Subtropical and one in the Warm Temperate region. Arid predominantly closed estuaries are confined to six systems in the Cool Temperate region. The Large and Small fluvially dominated types comprise seven systems each, occurring in three and two biogeographical regions, respectively. Small temporarily closed (116), Large temporarily closed (93), and Predominantly open (45) are the most dominant types occurring across the Cool Temperate, Warm Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions. Estuarine lakes occur across all four biogeographical zones. While not numerically dominant, this type represents the largest surface area of all estuary functional types, with Lake St Lucia representing more than half of South Africa’s estuarine surface area.\n\nEstuarine ecosystem examplesData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

To add a link, click on Insert &gt; Link. In the pop-up box, change the link to selection from URL to Heading, and select the heading of the section you want to link to. The display text will default to the header name. If you want to use different text, you need to tag your header. Select the header, and click on the three dots to the right. In the pop-up box, give the header a tag using the ID text box. The tag must start with #, e.g. #summary. Now you can link to it using the following syntax: display text.

For reference citations to work, there needs to be a .bib file stored in the same folder as the .qmd file. Give the .bib file a unique name (i.e. change it from the default references.bib). Make sure to edit the yaml header to reference the correct .bib file. See this bibtex reference for the formats for different types of references. The references.bib file in the quarto folder contains some example references:\nHere is a citation of a journal article1.\nHere is a citation of a book2.\nHere is a citation of an edited book3.\nHere is a citation of a book chapter4.\nHere is a citation of a report5.\nHere is a citation of a website6.\nHere is a citation of multiple references5,7,8\nFor a chapter or section in a book that is part of a series (e.g. Vegetation of South Africa) use the @inproceedings format9"

Using these code blocks also lets you cross-reference tables and figures in the text.\n\nGraphs and maps\nThe #| label: line in the code below makes it possible to reference the graph in the text. It must always start with fig- for Quarto to recognise it as a figure, and to apply correct styling and numbering to the figure caption. Each figure in your document must have a unique fig- name. To reference the figure in the text, use Insert &gt; Cross Reference, and look for the figure lable in the list.\nAdd an appropriate descriptive caption next to fig-cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Add figure caption here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nFollow the same system for creating tables. Do not use the visual editor to insert tables, as this will create a table in Quarto’s default style, and you will have to type in the data manually, making the table less reproducible if your data changes.

    "section": "Pollution",
    "text": "Pollution\nWater pollution is a major cause of the decline in freshwater species, particularly freshwater fishes. A combination of sediment, nutrient, chemical and thermal water pollution cumulatively impact the biodiversity and functioning of river and inland wetland ecosystem types and their associated freshwater species. Pollution (such as poorly or untreated wastewater effluent from industries and WWTWs, mining waste, acid mine drainage and agricultural return flows) not only significantly increases nutrients,metals, pesticides and other toxic compound loads, but can also change the natural temperature ranges and turbulence of aquatic environments. Furthermore, pharmaceuticals and micro-plastics are emerging contaminants that act as endocrine disruptors, impacting the productivity of aquatic species, and are of grave concern. Water pollution has dire, long-lasting consequences for aquatic organisms and hence ecosystems function. The Olifants River, which flows through the Kruger National Park, is a prime example of a river at the receiving end of a heavily utilised and degraded landscape. The impact of pollutants entering the river system have led to the demise of Endangered species such as the Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), attributed to pansteatitis, as well as the mortality of several fish species in Loskop Dam. A decline in piscivorous bird species has also been observed, including Pel’s Fishing Owl (Scotopelia peli).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems have limited pollution assimilation capacity, which is being exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepared by Donovan Kotze\nWetlands are at the frontline of wastewater1 impacts given their location at the interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environments, especially in South Africa, with its generally poor performance of wastewater treatment works and declining state of catchment water quality. In the most recent national assessment, 68% of wastewater treatment works were identified as at high or critical risk of discharging partially treated or untreated water into the environment.\nWhen using wetlands to enhance catchment water quality, the impacts on ecosystem services may be considerable. The use of wetlands to enhance water quality in polluted catchments has been well demonstrated. But a narrow focus on water quality objectives, will likely lead to failure to account more broadly for the impacts on wetland ecological health, ecosystem services supply and ultimately human wellbeing.\nMost ecosystem services provided by wetlands are negatively affected by wastewater inputs, except for rare instances where they are enhanced. One example is where nutrient-enriched wastewater promotes increased vegetation growth, which in turn increases the sediment carbon store in the wetland. Another example is when the prolonged hydroperiod and nutrient enrichment caused by the wastewater inputs may potentially enhance conditions for certain bird species, as occurred for the Lesser Flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor) at Kamfers Pan. These instances often occur in arid environments, such as the western parts of South Africa.\nThe vulnerability of wetlands to wastewater impacts depends on (1) wetland type (2) the wastewater inputs; and (3) other uses of the wetland. An inward draining (i.e. endorheic) wetland is inherently vulnerable as it has no outflow through which pollutants can be flushed from the system. High wastewater discharge with high loads of pathogenic bacteria impacts greatly on human wellbeing when use involves direct contact with the water, e.g. if used for conducting baptisms. If use of the wetland involves no direct contact with the water, e.g. as might be the case when observing water birds from a bird hide, the impacts in terms of human use would likely be less severe. Given the potential impacts and range in vulnerabilities, it is useful to distinguish between wetland areas and contexts which are most vulnerable to water quality impacts, and for which use should be kept to a minimum, and less vulnerable wetlands, which could potentially be designated as hard-working wetlands.\nThe pollutant assimilation capacity of wetlands is finite, and overloading a wetland will result in severe consequences for the wetland and downstream water users. Sustained point-source pollution into a wetland can overwhelm a wetland’s assimilative capacity, severely compromising its capacity to deal with non-point sources of pollution. In some cases where the initial effect of wastewater is positive, beyond a certain threshold its effect can dramatically shift to become negative, e.g. as occurred in the Kamfers Pan in 2011 when the sewage works was malfunctioning and many flamingos contracted avian pox virus through biting flies proliferating in the highly nutrient-enriched waters of the pan and which continues to recur.\nLong-term accumulation of pollutants in the sediments of wetlands pose a risk should the wetland sediments dry out or their biogeochemistry change. If a considerable amount of metals or other pollutants have accumulated over many decades under prolonged saturation in a wetland’s sediments, much of this can be released on drying out of the wetland (McCarthy and Venter 2006; McCarthy et al. 2007). The wetland may rapidly ’flip’ from being a major sink for metals and other pollutants to becoming a major source.",

    "text": "Climate change\nChanges in climate, particularly rise in temperature and changes to the amount, intensity and season of precipitation, are expected to exacerbate the impacts of current pressures on inland aquatic ecosystems. Global temperatures have increased by almost 1°C over the past 50 years and could increase another 1–2°C by 2050. Increasing temperature will impact the hydrological cycle, and consequently the functioning of rivers and inland wetlands. Significant reductions in amphibians’ range sizes are probable early impacts. In southern Africa, large lakes have shown increases in aquatic temperature, while the tropical cyclones that bring rain to the Maputaland Coastal Plain may move eastward, away from the African continent. Climate change is widely considered as a multiplier of other pressures on biodiversity, both exacerbating the effects of these pressures and altering the frequency, intensity and timing of events. Many of these shifts are predicted to benefit the survival of invasive species over native species and increase the outbreak potential and spread of disease. Considering that many freshwater species are range-restricted and that the fragmented state of ecosystems may prohibit range shift migrations, increasing the connectedness and size of the protected area network, including Ramsar sites, are key components of climate change adaptation strategies. In the inland aquatic realm, human responses to climate change are likely to further increase some pressures, for example, reduced rainfall due to climate change (exacerbated by biological invasions in catchment areas) drives an increase in water abstraction (for human settlements and agriculture), which compounds the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. xxxxxxxx\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepared by Casey Broom and Roland Schulze.\nWarming of as little as 1.5°C poses a considerable threat to freshwater ecosystems and the many critical services these systems provide. 2°C warming is highly likely to be exceeded in the middle of this century. The winter rainfall region is at a higher risk of multi-year droughts, with the summer rainfall areas projected to experience similar risk should warming reach 1.5° C or higher.\nImpacts of climate change on water temperatures are projected to vary across South Africa by between 1°C and 4°C, with the highest increases in the semi-desert Kalahari. Areas of the already hot and dry Northern Cape are highlighted as being particularly imperilled by a situation of presently low protection level, high threat and climate-related pressures. The occurrence of certain types of land use within the surrounding catchment may raise water temperatures within rivers to around 0.1°C higher than those driven by natural land cover. Notably, the Maputaland, coastal KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo areas, where temperatures may rise by 0.2 - 0.3°C, are highlighted as particularly vulnerable given the combination of low protection status, high ecosystem threat level, and some of the largest predicted shifts in temperature. Highs of 0.6 to 0.7+ above natural water temperatures may occur where large urban areas are located.\nSouth Africa’s freshwater ecosystems are largely inadequately protected, and the NBA 2025 assessment has identified those ecosystems which are both highly threatened and poorly protected. Many of these areas also overlap with areas where streamflow, water temperatures and sediment accumulation patterns are likely to undergo extensive change under near-future climate scenarios. Knowledge of areas most affected by climate-related changes and that affect ecosystem functioning and vulnerable species, is critical to ensure effective and timeous management response.\n\n\n\nNx",

Rivers and inland wetlands are the most heavily invaded ecosystems globally, largely due to their inherent connectivity and the intensity of anthropogenic activities. Of the 191 listed alien species in the inland aquatic realm, 65 are invasive. Of these invasive species, 27 severely impact biodiversity (5 fish species and 15 plant species). Nationally, 81% of freshwater fishes of conservation concern are impacted by invasive alien fishes. Many of these native species are endemic to the mountains of the Western Cape. The invasive species (e.g. Bass [Micopterus] species) impact on native species mainly through predation of juveniles and outcompeting adults for resources. This reduces population sizes and has caused population extirpation of many native species. In some cases, invasive species have hybridised with native species (e.g. invasive Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and the native Mozambique Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)). Invasive plants in natural rivers and wetlands threaten ecosystem integrity, alter fire regimes and change hydrological processes due to their high water consumption.",

However, inland wetland types are severely under-represented and under-protected in South Africa, with nearly 80% of wetland ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected. Freshwater-associated restoration efforts strategically implemented within protected areas continue to increase their effectiveness. However, achieving national conservation goals requires these efforts be amplified through a comprehensive network of conservation measures across the broader landscape.\nThe proportion of South Africa’s total wetland extent under statutory protection (i.e. in categories1 recognised under the Protected Areas Act) at the time of this assessment is 23% (600 000 ha). Taking wetland ecological condition into consideration, approximately 5% of inland wetland ecosystem extent is Well Protected, 6% is Moderately Protected, 69% is Poorly Protected and 20% is Not Protected.\nAccording to wetland type, 8 (10%) of inland wetland ecosystem types are Well Protected, 11 (13%) are Moderately Protected, 41 (50%) are Poorly Protected and 22 (27%) are Not Protected. Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape. Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape.\nTable 1. Ecosystem protection level and hydrogeomorphological (HGM) type for inland wetland ecosystem types.\nIn terms of wetland hydrogeomorphic type, depression wetlands have the highest protection level, with 33% of depression wetland types and 37% of depression wetland extent considered to be Well Protected, while only 11% and 10% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are considered Well Protected. No unchannelled valley-bottom wetland types are considered Well Protected.\nAlthough there has been positive progress in protecting inland wetland ecosystem types, the national protected area network could be strengthened to encompass a wider representation of South Africa’s inland wetlands and to afford protection to those that are Poorly Protected or Not Protected. Seventeen (20%) out of 82 inland wetland types are both highly threatened (i.e. Critically Endangered and Endangered) and under-protected (Not Protected or Poorly Protected). They are widespread, but found predominantly on the Highveld, along the eastern escarpment, in the Cape Fold Mountains and the arid Northern Cape.\nTable 3.

It will soon result in minor adjustments and an updated assessment, which will be widely communicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1.

    "text": "Approach\nEcosystem protection level is a headline indicator of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented within South Africa’s protected area network1. Read more about this indicator on the ecosystem protection level explainer page.\nKey input layers include the South African protected areas database2, the wetland ecosystem types, and wetland ecological condition assessment.\nWhile the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target for freshwater3 ecosystems, the current protection level target was adjusted to 30% in line with Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework. This target is applied to each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types. Importantly, the current ecological condition of the wetland within the protected area is taken into consideration in the calculation, ensuring that effectiveness is accounted for. At least 30% of each inland wetland ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition (ecological class A or B) to qualify in the Well Protected category. If this target was not met, the ecosystem type is categorised as Moderately Protected or lower, meaning that good condition wetlands contribute more to meeting protection level targets than poor condition wetlands.\nEcosystem types were assigned to one of four categories based on the percentage of the protection target met within the protected areas network, and scaled by ecological condition: Well Protected: 100% (or more) of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; but only wetlands in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and wetlands in an A and B condition contribute 100%, wetlands in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition wetlands contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition wetlands contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.\n\nChanges in ecosystem protection level results since the 2018 assessment reflect revised targets and improved methodologies for global and national alignment, alongside genuine changes in protection and updates to inland wetland ecological condition and mapping of wetland extent.",

    "text": "South Africa’s rivers are incredibly diverse, from the great Orange and Limpopo systems to vital small mountain streams. Their health is fundamental to our national well-being and economic success. An investment in a revised and expanded national river typology will strengthen technical understanding of our diverse river types, facilitating consistent assessment and effective management across the country. A renewed commitment to achieving the Ecological Reserve within our rivers is one of the most important available mechanisms for sustaining the viability of South Africa’s freshwater biodiversity as well as that of estuaries and marine systems dependent on adequate water and sediment replenishment. Upholding the Ecological Reserve is a critical investment in ecological infrastructure that helps buffer people and species from climate change impacts.\nThe network of river types for South Africa is the foundational input for assessing the status of rivers in the National Biodiversity Assessment. The river line network was used in order to align with the input dataset and results of the Water Research Commision and Department of Water and Sanitation joint project on the updated present ecological state and ecological importance and sensitivity of rivers1. Significant progress in earth observation and research partnerships have allowed SANBI and partners to draft a preliminary river area dataset for major rivers across South Africa, as well as a potential riparian ecosystem extent dataset. These, along with associated assessments of their status, will be added to this webpage once they are finalised.\nThe diverse rivers of South Africa are shaped by geology, climate, and immense timescales. The Orange-Vaal system rises in the higher rainfall mountains of Lesotho, then flows through increasingly arid country. Its immense age is contrasted by its small contribution to the total national runoff today, demonstrating how river systems can persist through vast climatic changes. Other rivers, like the Berg and the Olifants in the southwest, are also incredibly ancient; their courses are traceable back more than 80 million years and are notable for their clear, cool, and acid ‘black’ waters. Their long history is evident in the distribution patterns of their aquatic animals, which reflect ancient connections and separations caused by past sea level changes. The remaining perennial rivers are much shorter, especially those along the eastern and southern coasts. These systems have cut down in deep gorges as coastal margins tilted and sea levels dropped in recent geological time. They are subject to enormous hydrological fluctuations. Eastern rivers tend to be warm and turbid (muddy), with neutral to slightly alkaline waters, while south-central and south-western rivers are typically clear and carry cool, acid, ‘black’ waters. The Pongola and other large rivers in KZN form extensive, fertile floodplains in their lower reaches. Intermittent systems characterise the northern and north-western regions of South Africa. They include seasonally intermittent rivers that cease to flow annually and ephemeral or episodic rivers that flow only after occasional rainfall events with available water reduced to standing pools.\nFigure 2. A list of South Africa’s 122 river ecosystem types and their total length. Note this calculation is preliminary, as provinces and projects update the river extent and river area spatial accuracy for South Africa. Numerous projects are underway in this regard.\nIn line with the Global Ecosystem Typology, our rivers can be broadly divided into xxx. Consideration of the global typology allows us to leverage the monitoring capabilities of rapidly evolving Earth Observation technology and to report into global processes, including SDG 6.6 and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Emerging freshwater typologies for South Africa integrate river and wetland understanding. We have an interim typology in place and are currently at work on an updated national system to understand and manage our rivers as effectively as possible. The proposed river typology update will contribute significantly towards ensuring their long-term health and the benefits they provide to all South Africans. Work on updated river flow information,",

    "text": "Rivers are among the least protected ecosystems in South Africa. A whole catchment approach is needed to bend the curve on river conservation, as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. Rivers within Protected Areas that were assessed to be Poorly Protected due to their ecological condition may be prime targets for strategic restoration.\nApproximately 14% of the country’s river length occurs in protected areas. Of the rivers within protected areas, approximately 60% of these were assessed to be in a natural or near-natural ecological condition. This is much higher than the roughly 37% of rivers in a natural or near-natural ecological condition country-wide, however, this means that only 8% of river ecosystem types in South Africa are considered Well Protected, 13% Moderately Protected and 48% Poorly Protected, while 31% are considered Not Protected.\nThe rivers of northern KwaZulu-Natal, Lowveld and Succulent Karoo are generally less threatened than other regions of the country. Protection levels are particularly low in the northern interior of the country, reflecting the spatial distribution of the current protected areas network.\nTable 1. Ecosystem protection level of river ecosystem types.\nIn terms of river geomorphological zone, only 16% of the river ecosystem types within the lower foothill and mountain stream zones are Well Protected. More than half of lowland river ecosystem types are Not Protected (61%), reflecting the bias of the protected area network towards mountain versus lowland areas.\nIt is evident that formal protection does not guarantee biodiversity conservation as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. A whole catchment and OECM approach, including conservation corridors, to river conservation is therefore required since most land-based protected areas were not designed to protect rivers.\nTable 3.

    "text": "Approach\nEcosystem protection level is a headline indicator of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented within South Africa’s protected area network1. Read more about this indicator on the ecosystem protection level explainer page.\nKey input layers include the South African protected areas database, the river ecosystem network, and river ecological condition assessment2.\nWhile the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target for freshwater ecosystems[3], the current protection level target was adjusted to 30% in line with Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework. This target is applied to each of the 122 river ecosystem types. Importantly, the current ecological condition of the river within the protected area is taken into consideration in the calculation, ensuring that effectiveness is accounted for. At least 30% of each river ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition (ecological class A or B) to qualify in the Well Protected category. If this target was not met, the ecosystem type is categorised as Moderately Protected or lower, meaning that higher integrity rivers contribute more to meeting protection level targets than low integrity rivers.\nEcosystem types were assigned to one of four categories based on the percentage of the protection target met within the protected areas network, and scaled by ecological condition: Well Protected: 100% (or more) of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; but only rivers in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and rivers in an A and B condition contribute 100%, rivers in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition rivers contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.\n\nChanges in ecosystem protection level results since the 2018 assessment reflect revised targets and improved methodologies for global and national alignment, alongside genuine changes in protection and updates to river ecological condition.",

    "text": "Freshwater ecosystems – rivers and inland wetlands – are the lifeblood of South Africa, underpinning our water security, economy, and cultural heritage. However, more than 60% are in a compromised ecological condition. This places the vital services they provide, and the incredible biodiversity they support at risk. It is greatly concerning that the number of threatened freshwater species continues to rise.\nRivers and inland wetlands are among the most threatened1 and least protected ecosystems in South Africa. More than 64% of river ecosystem types and 73% of wetland ecosystem types are threatened (key message B2).\nOver 30% (82/222) of river ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under-protected. Approximately 12% (17/82) of inland wetland ecosystem types are highly threatened and under-protected.\nIt follows that the freshwater species which these ecosystems support are increasingly highly threatened. Over 36% of all assessed freshwater taxa and 66% of assessed endemic freshwater taxa are threatened, while 36% of all freshwater fishes and 66% of endemic freshwater fishes are threatened.\nFreshwater fishes are the most threatened of all taxa in South Africa. With escalating pressures from human activities and climate change, it is highly concerning that 59 waterbird species have been uplisted, with 5 listed as Endangered, 11 Vulnerable and the remaining Near Threatened, while the African Shaggy Rat (previously African Marsh Rat) and the Laminate Vlei Rat have been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened during the current assessment. This is the first time that freshwater invertebrates have been included into the national biodiversity assessment.\nIn the face of increasing pressures, South African freshwater ecosystems continue to degrade faster than the investment in their conservation, management and rehabilitation. Key pressures include disruptions to the hydrological regime, deteriorating water quality (key message A3), direct habitat loss and biological invasions (key message A4), as well as the exacerbating effect of climate change (key message A1).\nAs freshwater ecosystems are affected by land use within their receiving catchment (key message A2), they are not easily protected within nature reserves and, therefore, implementation of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs2), ecological corridors and sustained hydrological and sediment connectivity is vital. We must collaborate across all levels of society (key message C1) to conserve and wisely manage our remaining intact rivers and inland wetlands, and the freshwater species that they support. Urgent action is required to increase attention and funding on freshwater ecosystems and species, and to implement restorative actions in strategically identified areas.",

    "text": "Cumulative Pressures\nSouth Africa uses cumulative pressure mapping as a key input into the assessment of marine ecosystem threat status. A total of 31 pressures have been mapped to support biodiversity assessment and spatial planning1. These include historical pressures that may have ceased in some areas but have contributed to long-term changes in ecological condition. Both the number and intensity of pressures is considered in cumulative pressure mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas have the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas with high cumulative pressures include most bays, the area offshore of the Orange River, the shelf edge off the west and south coasts, large portions of the Cape inner and middle shelf, the Agulhas Bank and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. The highest cumulative pressure in the marine realm was recorded in Saldanha Bay.\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which alter shorelines and circulation, increase urbanisation and access for fishers, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. New ports and harbours can have substantial impacts on marine biodiversity and livelihoods and therefore warrant careful evaluation in spatial planning and decision-making.\nSkein et al. (2022) examined 17 key pressures from 17 different sectors and their links to 23 key ecosystem characteristics (Figure 1) that have implications for ecosystem services. Fishing, petroleum (referred to as “Non-renewable (oil and gas)” in Figure 1) and shipping had the most widespread effects across the most ecosystem components, accounting for 30% of total linkage pathways identified, with fishing showing the most linkages overall. This is due to the extensive and complex nature of these three sectors, each of which comprise various components that may impact marine life in different ways. For example, offshore oil and gas sector activities include exploration (invasive and non-invasive), production and transport, each exerting different pressures on marine biodiversity. Anticipated renewable energy installations will have implications for marine ecosystems and species in future, through increased underwater noise, habitat modification and wildlife collisions, depending on the energy source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. South African marine ecosystem risk assessment Sankey diagram illustrating links among sectors (left), their associated pressures (middle) and the ecological components (right) that are impacted by these pressures. The width of the lines represent the Impact Risk (describing the exposure and severity of an interaction). Sectors, pressures and ecological components appear in descending order based on sum Impact Risk scores (Skein et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nPervasive pressures with multiple drivers (Cross-cutting pressures) include pollution emanating from industrial, municipal and agricultural sources, ocean noise associated with activities such as shipping, mining and petroleum exploration, light pollution from artificial light at night especially in coastal areas, and invasive alien species.\nClimate change and ocean acidification, primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, cause diverse and interrelated pressures that impact marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. Furthermore, by creating stressful environmental conditions (e.g. altered temperatures or reduced oxygen levels), climate change and ocean acidification increase the vulnerability of marine life to other pressures such as pollution or the impacts of fishing.\nThe indirect and cumulative impacts of expanding ocean activities need more attention in marine environmental management. Failure to account for potential cumulative and indirect impacts will preclude such impacts from being taken into account in spatial planning and decision-making, with likely negative implications for people and the environment.",

    "text": "Sector and pressure overviews\nPressure data sets are important inputs into spatial assessments and planning. Marine pressure data for South Africa is described in the 2018 NBA marine technical report1 that explained and mapped each pressure, summarised patterns in their extent and intensity, and reviewed their known biodiversity impacts, noting any known mitigation measures or relevant work that was underway. Drawing on the above and information that is available in more recent National Data and Information Report for Marine Spatial Planning2, a brief summary of sectors and pressures is provided below (only references not previously cited in Majiedt et al. (2019) are indicated).\nIn general, updating and improvement of pressure data sets are required. Outdated pressure maps, pressure data that are missing or of a poor resolution, and inaccurate estimation of pressure impacts on ecological condition, all reduce the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and the efficacy of spatial planning. For example, missing pressure data in certain areas or for certain sub-sectors (such as small-scale fishing) omits key rightsholders and compromises integrated and equitable spatial planning. Long-term pressure data series are needed for ecosystem and species assessment (key message B5) and finer scale mapping for more accurate assessment of ecological condition.\n\nFishing\n\n\n\nSouth African fisheries provide food, employment and revenue and are making progress in addressing impacts on marine biodiversity. (© Peter Chadwick, African Conservation Photographer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFishing incorporates at least 19 South African fishing sectors representing industrial, commercial, small-scale, artisanal and recreational fisheries, with a variety of methods employed to target a wide range of fish, invertebrate and seaweed resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFishing methods include trawling (demersal and mid-water), longlining (demersal and pelagic), purse-seining, linefishing, squid jigging, trap fishing, hand harvesting, beach seining, and wet and dry kelp harvesting.\nMore than 700 marine species are directly affected by fishing in South Africa3, with bycatch a key concern for trawl and longline fisheries. There have been improvements in managing incidental mortalities of seabirds, but bycatch of sharks, skates and rays is a driver of the threatened status of this group (see shark species page) with work underway to support improved management4. More information on fisheries impacts on stock status or species threat status is reported in the species page for the marine realm.\nFisheries affect benthic and pelagic ecosystems through multiple pathways of impact5, with the impact of the demersal trawl and longline fisheries on seabed habitats providing a straightforward example (Figure 2). Measures have been taken to manage the ecosystem impacts of trawl fishing through freezing the demersal hake trawl footprint, new co-developed spatial management measures and work to identify and protect Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems6 (Sink et al. 2025 - the trawl report).\nUnsustainable fishing includes overfishing of target or bycatch species and fishing practices that can have severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Overfishing can include unsustainable total numbers of fish being caught and overharvesting of specific size or age classes that are critical for maintaining population growth and fishery sustainability. Some fishing gear types are known to incidentally catch high numbers of non-target species (bycatch or incidental mortalities) and/or to impact seabed habitats. Illegal fishing and ghost fishing from lost fishing gear are difficult to map and qualify, but these unsustainable fishing practices can have negative impacts on the food web (trophic effects) and lead to ecosystem degradation.\nAlthough industrial fisheries generally have greater and more widespread impacts on marine ecosystems and species, all fisheries sectors contribute to fishing pressures in the marine realm. In terms of participation, the recreational fishery is the largest of all the fishing sectors in South Africa (460-550 000 fishers7). This and the high technical capacity8 of mobile recreational fishers dispersed along the entire coast means that this sector has a significant impact on fisheries resources. Furthermore, the recreational fishery is currently ineffectively governed by inadequate policy and regulations and remains largely unmonitored and poorly enforced9, with high levels of non-compliance (~50%10) and poor environmental behaviours being the norm in many recreational fisher communities11,12. While some commercial linefish species have demonstrated recent recovery, many species, also targeted by the recreational fishery, remain overexploited13, especially kobs (see species summary page) and some seabreams (see seabream page.\nThere is evidence of some pro-active, conscientious recreational fishers adopting voluntary catch-and-release and other best practices in a growing social movement of self-reform14,15. However, while there is growing acceptance of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) practice as an essential practice, there is a growing consensus that poor release practices can still contribute considerably to fishing mortality16,17. Potential indicators of progress in the reform of recreational fisheries have been identified Action 5 of SANBI’s priority actions.\nOverfishing can also impact genetic biodiversity of fishery species by reducing diversity and effective population size, compromising their resilience and ability to adapt18. A recent study highlighted the long-term evolutionary costs of overfishing of the seventy-four seabream (Polysteganus undulosus) which has suffered drastic decline in genetic diversity and effective population size19. Recent genomic studies on kingklip (Genypterus capensis) revealed three genetically distinct populations across southern African waters, with signs of local adaptation20, highlighting the need for sustainable, spatially specific, transboundary management. Similarly, the two African hake species (Merluccius spp.) both show low genome-wide diversity. Shallow-water hake (M. capensis) shows three structured populations across the Benguela Current region, while deep-water hake (M. paradoxus), previously considered panmictic, now shows a split between the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean populations21. Managing species with spatially distinct sub-populations as single stocks may further exacerbate their low genomic diversity.\nBuilding on previous successes, fisheries management can support resource, species and ecosystem recovery (key message A5 and B1). Strengthened ecosystem-based fisheries management can be achieved through reviews and updates to ecological risk assessments, development and implementation of effective fisheries management plans, improved bycatch monitoring and management, increased biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries, improved societal and user participation in fisheries regulation and decision making and strengthened collaboration among ocean institutions (Priority actions 5, 1, 2, 3 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10).\n\n\n\n\n\nLethal shark control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has employed lethal shark control measures in the province of KwaZulu-Natal since 1952 to protect bathers from the risk of shark bites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese measures, comprising gill nets and baited hooks (drum lines), are implemented to reduce the population of sharks in the vicinity of certain beaches, thereby reducing the probability of an ocean user encountering a shark. These measures are implemented between Richards Bay and Port Edward with 13.5 km of nets and 177 baited drumlines deployed in summer and 0.2 km of nets and 270 baited drumlines in winter (see Improvements in shark control measures). Biodiversity concerns associated with the shark control program include the overexploited and threatened status of several target and bycatch species of cartilaginous fishes (see shark, rays, and chimeras species page), catches of turtles and marine mammal species (see species summary page) and potential ecosystem effects linked to the removal of predatory sharks. Of the 14 species of large sharks regularly caught by the KwaZulu-Natal sharks board, 11 are threatened. All of the affected marine mammal and turtle species are listed as Threatened or Protected species under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act.\nLethal shark control measures add to the pressure on elasmobranchs from other fisheries, particularly longlining and trawl fisheries, but also recreational fisheries. The ecosystem effects from shark control programs are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. Historical and current nets were considered in the assessment of ecosystem condition, noting ongoing efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of shark control measures in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Improvements in shark control measures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has taken several steps to reduce the impacts of lethal shark control measures on marine species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 Km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025. Nets have been replaced with baited drum lines in several areas and a distinct seasonal strategy was introduced to reduce negative impacts while maintaining bather safety. In particular, nets are removed during the annual sardine run during winter to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities on sharks and other species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025, with the replacement of some nets by baited drumlines. Seasonal changes during the annual sardine run and whale migration see most of the remaining nets substituted with drumlines to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities of sharks and other species.\nExperimental work on mesh size, acoustic pingers and other innovations to reduce impacts have also been conducted and there is ongoing research to improve the evidence base for shark management. Overall, there is a reported 80% reduction in total catch and substantially reduced mortalities of sharks and other marine species (KZN Sharks Board pers. comm.). A network of researchers tag sharks and use satellite and acoustic tracking to better understand shark movement. Such data are very useful in better understanding shark distribution and risks in terms of location, season and other temporal trends. Increased investment in research, particularly movement studies, could strengthen the knowledge base for managing human wildlife conflict in the marine realm.\nOther provinces have implemented non-lethal measures that have little to no impact on marine life and these measures are not included as a pressure layer in this assessment. Local conditions affect the feasibility of different models with history of shark control, visibility, sea conditions, vantage points, launch site proximity and the local infrastructure and networks affecting options for shark control and bather safety. Bather exclusion nets and a shark spotter programme help protect bathers in Cape Town, while Plettenberg Bay has also implemented shark spotters and an innovative network to support bather safety (NSRI technology). Two other countries that have shark control programs recently introduced new non-lethal measures including drones to help detect sharks and smart drumlines that alert crew when an animal takes the bait so that they can launch immediately to free any bycatch and euthanise (severely injured) target sharks (Reunion Island) or translocate them (Australia). There are increasing studies that support the development and testing of shark-bite mitigation measures, however a lack of standardisation challenges effective comparisons of these measures22.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal and offshore mining\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal and offshore mining is increasing in South Africa, targeting diamonds, heavy minerals and sand, and depending on the method of extraction, can have moderate to very severe negative impacts on biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpacts include habitat destruction and modification (including beach morphodynamic type), sediment suspension and increased turbidity, pollution, noise, changes in the distribution and feeding habits of species and the introduction of alien species. Ecosystems that are impacted include beaches and shallow and deep benthic ecosystems on the shelf23–25.\nSuspended and deposited sediments caused by operations decrease feeding efficiency of filter feeders and clog fish gills, while increased turbidity from mine tailings can reduce primary production with reported changes in community structure. The potential for phosphate mining to commence remains a concern because the impacts of this activity could severely modify large areas of ecosystems and could jeopardise the sustainability of fisheries.\nMining affects vulnerable coastal communities and has impacts on small scale fishers who lose access to traditional fishing grounds . There are serious concerns that mining affects the rights of local communities in terms of food and culture and that mining may lead to risks to and impacts on natural and cultural heritage and aesthetic, recreational and tourism values.\nThe cumulative impacts of mining are a concern with increasing mining activity along South Africa’s West Coast and shelf. Although many environmental assessment practitioners may include a section on cumulative impacts in assessments, these are seldom comprehensive and usually fail to consider past, present and future impacts or other developments in the surrounding area. Currently, there is no marine biodiversity information in the screening tool used to support environmental impact assessments and very limited information for the marine realm was included in the biodiversity and mining guidelines produced in 2013.\nThe management of mining impacts could be improved through the inclusion and adequate consideration of cumulative impacts in mining authorizations, strategic planning and protection and the implementation of positive incentives for responsible mining (Priority actions 3, 1, 2, 6, 9 and 10). There may be a need to strengthen monitoring and enforcement of mining activity for stronger compliance with environmental authorisation conditions.\nOther environmental management tools (such as Strategic Environmental Assessments and Environmental Management Frameworks) could be harnessed to support more strategic mining decisions to ensure that critical coastal and marine ecosystem services are maintained. Such measures could help manage and restore coastal ecological infrastructure, reduce risks to food security and improve the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities. Strengthening collaborative, biodiversity-inclusive planning is essential to safeguard natural capital while enabling mineral development (key message A2).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine petroleum activities\n\n\n\nPretroleum infrastructure on the Agulhas bank. (© Lara Atkinson)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMarine petroleum activities in South Africa were initiated in 1969 with more than 300 offshore wells drilled to date and ongoing exploration by seismic survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of petroleum activities span the impacts associated with exploration, production and transport. Petroleum production has been suspended at the Oribi/Oryx and Sable oil fields (Block 9 off Mossel Bay) and the F-A Gas field and satellites but field development plans are underway at the Ibhubesi gas field off Hondeklipbaai. While production has largely decreased in recent years in South Africa, exploration activities have expanded into deeper water (Figure 3) and there has been increasing concern about the negative impacts of seismic surveys, in particular, on marine species and ecosystems. This is because of the intense and widespread noise that these surveys generate, which can have varied, far-reaching and cumulative impacts on multiple species and ecosystem processes. A cumulative map of seismic surveys was recently compiled and there is some progress in planning for the integration of underwater noise into assessments and planning26. See Pollution section.\nBiodiversity impacts associated with drilling and production include habitat loss from infrastructure installation; chemical pollution from water- and oil-based drilling muds, noise and light pollution. These impacts can cause physical and physiological damage to marine organisms, disrupt feeding, communication and migration and alter species distributions and aggregations. Petroleum infrastructure including pipelines for transport can also introduce, provide refuge for and facilitate the spread of alien and invasive species. Oil spills, leaks and blowouts pose serious risks with the potential to cause catastrophic impacts to marine biodiversity by oiling marine organisms, degrading ecosystems, and disrupting ecological processes, while also causing health risks to people. The chemical dispersants used in cleaning up oil spills can also impact marine life, and in some cases, are considered more toxic than the oil itself.\nImproving the understanding of the biodiversity impacts from oil and gas activities will enable better mitigation and management of impacts. Given current uncertain impacts, precautionary management is recommended. Spatial planning (key message A2) can support development while safeguarding ecosystem services. To counter the uncertain impacts of seismic surveys (see Understanding underwater radiated noise in South Africa’s oceans), there is a need to identify, map and safeguard noise sensitive ecosystems and species and review current mitigation measures in the context of international good practice (Priority actions 7 and 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShipping is a widespread source of pressure in South Africa’s marine realm and is a key source of underwater noise and other pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is a maritime nation with considerable ship traffic and one of the highest concentrations of cargo ship and oil tanker traffic globally. While shipping is the dominant form of underwater noise in the ocean, affecting a broad range of marine species27, there are also other environmental and biodiversity impacts, including other forms of pollution (e.g. chemical pollution, accidental oil spills, air pollution and other), the introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling, and ship strikes (collisions between vessels and large marine animals).\nSouth Africa still needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013 (Priority action 3). More effective management of shipping in noise sensitive areas such as marine protected areas, including by regulating the maximum speed of vessels, can strengthen protection by reducing underwater noise levels and the risk of collisions. See Pollution section.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal development, including port development, is a significant cause of pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems, leading to ecosystem loss, interruption of physical and biological process, and compromises in ecosystem resilience and services1,28–30. Coastal development has also impacted coastal species and contributed to the pressures on coastal invertebrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal development within the littoral active zone deprives beaches of the sand stored in dunes and reduces coastal resilience to storms, high wave-energy events and sea-level rise, increasing risks to coastal communities and infrastructure. Such development can require expensive artificial movement of sand or other coastal engineering solutions to mitigate downstream erosion.\nIn addition to coastal development impacts, ports and harbours are the main points of introduction and refugia for invasive alien species, and activities associated with them contribute to ecosystem degradation from smothering, pollution, underwater noise and anchorage. Coastal disturbance is common at popular and accessible beaches (especially around access points), and includes trampling, dune destabilisation and disturbance of shore birds or other shore animals. For more information see the coastal realm pages.\nBiodiversity-inclusive co-ordinated coastal and marine spatial planning (key message A2) is important in managing the impacts of coastal development and guiding the placement of new ports and harbours. Steps to prevent, detect and manage invasive species (key message A4) are needed in ports and harbours. Effective strategic restoration guided by robust science (key message B3) can mitigate coastal development impacts. Avoiding and reducing the impacts of coastal development can support climate risk mitigation and science-based restoration could support in this context (Priority actions see Action 10).\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe biodiversity impacts of mariculture depend on the species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, husbandry practices and environmental conditions at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture along the South African coast includes farming of shellfish or finfish and takes the form of land-based operations that abstract seawater, pass it through a culture facility, and return it to the sea, and sea-based operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages suspended directly in the sea and a limited number of estuaries. Little research has been undertaken on the impacts of mariculture in South Africa but local work has highlighted the risks associated with eutrophication and the introduction of alien species, pathogens and diseases that can be transferred to wild stocks. For example, high stocking densities could potentially result in the evolution of native pathogens (especially viral and bacterial agents) to which wild fish do not have resistance. As such, mariculture can impact on ecosystem services.\nCurrently, sea-based mariculture takes place only in Saldanha Bay and Algoa Bay in South Africa. High retention and therefore lower rates of flushing of pollutants or elevated nutrient inputs in bays are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts of sea-based mariculture operations in these areas. Sea-based mariculture operations are also known to alter predator behaviour and movement patterns by causing them to aggregate in the vicinity of installations, and may therefore shift predation pressure on wild populations with resulting food web effects. Although there has been little success in sea-based aquaculture of bony fish in South Africa, mariculture remains a sector of projected growth, similar to petroleum and shipping.\nAppropriate placement of mariculture in feasible areas that have sufficient environmental quality for food production without undermining biodiversity conservation efforts is needed. Biodiversity-inclusive marine spatial planning can help provide an opportunity to support livelihoods, food security and the development of the blue economy while maintaining ecological infrastructure (key message A2). Mitigation measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species and pathogens, minimise impacts on and maintain water quality are critical in managing mariculture (Priority actions 3, 9, 2 and 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater flow reduction\n\n\n\nFlow reduction threatens marine ecosystems, species and associated fisheries benefits. (© Bronwyn Goble, Oceanographic Reasearch Institute)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFreshwater flow reduction to the coastal and marine environment occurs when water is abstracted from rivers or dammed higher up in the catchment, and/or the cycle of an estuary has been disrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in freshwater, and the accompanying sediment that is vital to many marine biodiversity processes, failing to reach the sea. By reducing input of sediment that forms and maintain beaches, mud habitats and other unconsolidated sediment ecosystems, flow reduction leads to physical habitat changes including loss of beach and mud habitat, impacts on ecological functions and services including nursery functions, environmental cues, productivity, nutrient provision and food web processes1. Reductions in key fisheries catches linked to reduced flow with associated negative economic impacts have also been reported in South Africa.\nA third of South Africa’s freshwater flow in rivers is estimated to no longer reach the ocean, including approximately two-thirds of the potential freshwater flow of the Orange River and nearly a third of that for the Thukela River (the two largest catchments in South Africa). Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated and coordinated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure (key message A7 and priority action 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nWastewater discharge\n\n\n\nWaste water discharge impacts biodiversity, the economy and human health. (© Jean Tresfon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWastewater discharge represents a significant source of pollution and includes a range of inputs, including industrial and municipal effluents, brine discharges from desalination plants, effluents from aquaculture operations, and stormwater and agricultural runoff1,31–33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 3 billion cubic metres of waste is discharged annually into South Africa’s marine environment through estuaries and outfalls, with municipal wastewater treatment facilities accounting for a significant portion of this. Wastewater discharge impairs water and sediment quality, and causes changes in the primary producer and benthic invertebrate communities near discharge points1. High organic and nutrient loading due to wastewater discharge causes excessive eutrophication, fuelling red tides, harmful algal blooms and anoxia, often leading to fish kills. Coastal groundwater discharge is similarly enriched by human settlements, impacting shore ecosystems.\nTypically, coastal water quality is substantially degraded near major urban centres, with greatest negative impacts in areas with weak flushing and long retention, in particular bays. Associated microbial pollution can also have serious health and socio-economic impacts. For example, poor water quality has resulted in beach closures and loss of recreational value and tourism income. See Pollution section. Restoring degraded sewerage infrastructure is one of the ways in which coastal water quality can be improved (Priority action 3 and 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nDredge disposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDredge disposal is the dumping at sea of accumulated sediment from dredge material leading to smothering, increased turbidity, decreased primary production and other potential impacts34,35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDredging is a key service performed by the Ports Authority as part of harbour management and maintenance, whereby dredge material is collected from harbours to ensure that ships do not run aground. The type of disposal methodology applied, as well as the quality of the sediment being deposited, may amplify or mitigate these environmental impacts.\nAlthough the impacts of dredge disposal have not been examined in South Africa, the risk of introduction of pollutants into the ocean from dredge have been recognised. This risk can be managed through improved pollution management within ports and harbours to reduce the amount of potential transfer to the open ocean when dredge material is disposed of. International good practice also recommends the reuse of dredge material where feasible (e.g. beach nourishment).\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmunition disposal\n\n\n\nAmmunition disposal in the ocean poses several risks to both species and ecosystems. (© Jana Ulrich)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAmmunition disposal was practised in demarcated areas of the offshore environment from 1970s until 1995, before the London Protocol (1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter) came into effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDumped ammunition can cause damage to or smothering of ecosystems and habitat-forming species; potentially detonate, causing localised destruction; and corrode, causing pollution and toxicity, especially from heavy metals1,36. Elsewhere, there is evidence of munition compounds bioaccumulating in marine foodwebs, which is predicted to increase with time and with changes in ocean chemistry37. Presumably, dumped munitions in South Africa have corroded over the past 30-50 years, but the impacts are largely unknown. This pressure has ceased.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy production\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRenewable energy production is important in achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts and supporting socio-economic growth in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) in South Africa includes offshore wind, wave, current and thermal energy sources. Although no MRE projects currently exist, there are plans for development, e.g. a floating offshore windfarm at Richard’s Bay and energy generation from the Agulhas current has been under discussion for several years. Depending on the energy source, potential impacts of MRE include habitat disturbance and loss during construction, changes in hydrology, localised upwelling and electromagnetic fields, collision risks with wind or current turbines for seabirds and ocean life and increased ocean noise. Wave and current devices may negatively impact marine mammals, turtles, and fish through collision risk, electromagnetic fields, and underwater noise, and marine benthic and pelagic habitats and communities could be impacted by changes to natural seawater flows and sediment transport. Small installations would likely have localised minor impacts but large commercial arrays could significantly alter marine systems over time.\nEmerging renewable energy installations include planned photovoltaic solar plants for Saldanha and Cape Town, and planned green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia) initiatives for Boegoebaai, Saldanha Bay, and Coega. Green hydrogen development requires extensive new coastal and marine infrastructure, likely including desalination plants, with associated brine discharge being an important environmental concern for coastal ecosystems. Other potential impacts include pollution from the production and transportation of hydrogen derivatives, like ammonia or methanol, which use catalysts and chemicals that could contaminate soil or water if not properly managed.\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy remain important for mitigating climate change (key message A1). The marine realm may have a significant role to play in the just transition to renewable energy. Impacts of marine ecosystems and biodiversity will be dependent on the type and placement of renewable energy arrays. Biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning is the best mechanism to achieve appropriate placement, and more research is needed to understand potential impacts and guide mitigation measures.",

    "text": "Cross-cutting pressures\n\nPollution (including underwater noise)\nPollution is a cross-cutting pressure linked to many sectors with chemical (including plastic), pharmaceutical, noise and light pollution all increasing. Plastic, both micro- and macro-plastic, is pervasive and has been recorded at great depths and distance from shore, although its main source is land-based pollution. Plastic pollution has impacts on many marine species through ingestion and entanglement, especially seabirds, turtles, sharks and fish. South African research is increasing and providing valuable insights into this global concern38–41, which recently has also been linked to the spread of alien and invasive species and identified as a vector for toxic metals42. Other common pollutants in the marine realm are heavy metals and hydrocarbons, especially in ports and harbours43,44.\nIngestion and bioaccumulation of microplastics, metals, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products and other organic pollutants in animal tissues potentially leads to their biomagnification in marine food webs32,38,45. This poses toxic risks to lower and higher trophic level biota and humans who consume them. Bioaccumulation of pesticides and herbicides in coral reef organisms is an increasing concern33,46, while high concentrations of metals, other chemicals, and pollutants have been detected in sediments (especially in ports and harbours), surf zones of popular recreational beaches and in sponges within submarine canyons. These pollutants have also been found in turtles and their eggs, seabirds and seabird eggs, fish, cetaceans, sharks and marine mammals.\nLight pollution or artificial light at night can negatively impact species and ecosystems by interrupting species’ natural circadian rhythms, changing night-time activity through either negative or positive phototaxis47,48. Feeding, breeding and resting behaviours are affected with impacts on turtle hatchlings and seabirds and beach invertebrates of particular concern29,30,47. For example, several beach species including the Endangered Cape pill bugs, Tylos capensis (nocturnal sandy beach isopods;29) are significantly less active at night when exposed to higher light intensities, which reduces their foraging time. Light pollution can also affect navigation of seabirds and cause grounding with risk of injury or mortality49. There is increasing concern regarding the effect of artificial light at night on phytoplantkton and cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems and potential increased risks of harmful algal blooms with calls for increased research on this topic50.\nGood practice in mitigating light pollution includes measures to direct, shield and reduce duration, angle and intensity of light51. Effective communication about the impacts of artificial light at night and opportunities to address light pollution while supporting energy reduction and climate change is needed in South Africa. Reducing light pollution in protected and conserved areas is particularly important51 and can also contribute to cultural heritage protection, star gazing opportunities and astronomy research.\nNoise pollution is an increasing concern, particularly in aquatic environments where sound conductivity is greater than in air and where many species rely on sound for prey location and communication27,52. Sources of sound include seismic surveys26, shipping traffic, bunkering53, various other commercial activities, and boating. Elevated underwater noise can cause direct mortality, lower immunity and increase health risks, change species distributions and disrupt foraging when predators, prey, or both avoid noisy areas, and disrupt reproduction, communication and social behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Cumulative map of seismic survey activity in the marine realm between 1980 and 2020 (Wilkinson et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine mammals and soniferous fish are particularly at risk, including commercially important species such as kingklip, recreationally important species such as grunter and threatened species such as dusky kob and Syngnathid seahorses and pipefish. Recently, penguins have shown sensitivity to underwater noise53 and there is concern that current mitigation measures for seismic surveys may be inadequate in managing impacts on marine animals54. Although there are many known impacts from underwater noise, there are still many gaps in our understanding of these pressures55 and how they may translate into ecosystem impacts. It is recommended that noise sensitive marine areas are proactively mapped and used to inform marine spatial planning and management26 and there is increasing collaborative efforts to provide guidance in protecting marine fauna from noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Understanding underwater radiated noise in South Africa’s oceans.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, there is increasing recognition of the impacts of anthropogenic noise pollution on a wide range of taxa and habitats, and South Africa is prioritising an improved understanding and reduced effects of underwater radiated noise on marine life. New research that has been initiated in this context includes the project “Sound Seas: Linking marine soundscapes to ecosystem conditions and health”. This is a multidisciplinary project funded by the National Research Foundation through the African Coelacanth Ecosystem Programme and spans acoustic research, biodiversity, ecology, fisheries, geology, oceanography and marine engineering.\nThe Sound Seas project aims to determine the extent to which the underwater marine soundscape can provide information about the ecological condition of marine ecosystems and which tools (systems and methods) can be developed for monitoring these environments and assisting management, decision-making and policy. The team is developing capacity in underwater soundscape ecology and acoustics research in South Africa and will provide baselines for further research and monitoring on marine soundscapes and the impacts of anthropogenic noise sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive alien species\n\n\n\nMarine alien invasive species impact South Afirca’s biodiversity, ocean economy and coastal communities. Pictured is Carcinus maenas an invasive crab found in South Africa. (© Charles Griffiths)\n\n\nInvasive alien species have profound negative impact on marine biodiversity with increasing numbers of introduced marine species in South Africa56,57. Alien species have the potential to displace native species, cause the loss of native genotypes, modify habitats, change community structure, affect food web properties and ecosystem processes, impede the provision of ecosystem services, impact human health and cause substantial economic losses.\nThe main mechanisms of accidental introductions are ship fouling, ballast water and mariculture58, with increasing recognition of the role of petroleum infrastructure and recreational boating in the introduction and intra-regional spread of invasive species. The expanding aquarium trade is also a potential source of introductions.\nPreventing marine invasives and limiting spread is vital as research shows that eradication in the marine realm is not feasible. This means that prevention is critical and key pathways, particularly ballast water and hull fouling, require management action. Strategic monitoring is also recommended59 and ringfenced resources are needed to enable rapid management action (key message A4).\nSouth Africa needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013 and invest in innovative methods and partnerships to reduce hull fouling and the spread of marine invasives (Priority actions 3 and 9). Increased efforts are needed to prevent marine invasive species introduction in MPAs and coastal conservation areas. Innovative communication and citizen science can help inform industry and civil society to help prevent and detect introductions.\n\n\nClimate change\n\n\n\nCoral bleaching is a highly visible symptom of climate change. (© Sean Porter, Oceanographic Research Institute)\n\n\nClimate change exacerbates impacts of pressures on marine species and ecosystems through multifaceted pathways, decreasing resilience and threatening coastal communities and livelihoods60–62. South Africa’s oceans are changing with increased winds, upwelling and cooling being observed in some areas, and warming in others58. Increased storm events, sea-level rise, intensification of current variability and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events have also been observed, and work is underway to support baselines to detect any potential changes in pH through ocean acidification63–65.\nThe impacts of these changes have been documented across a wide variety of marine taxa including kelp, other seaweeds, foraminifera, corals, sponges, molluscs, crustaceans, copepods, fish and seabirds66. Reported impacts include shifts in the distribution of species and communities, changes in species abundance, altered behaviour, hybridisation, increased spread of invasive species, and long-term declines in fished stocks and copepods. Coral bleaching is increasing46 and there is a need to invest in coral monitoring to track reef health. South Africa’s three coral ecosystem types are now considered Vulnerable to ecosystem collapse (see threat status page) and 34% of the 128 shallow reef building corals reported in South Africa have now been assessed as threatened (see species summary page).\nClimate change does not act in isolation, it interacts with other anthropogenic pressures and understanding these interactions is critical for effective conservation and climate mitigation strategies to protect biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability67. The complexity and variability of South Africa’s marine systems, combined with multiple anthropogenic stressors, make future climate impacts difficult to predict, but there is high certainty that negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security and valuable economic industries will continue to escalate.\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy are important for mitigating climate change (key message A1). In addition, coastal ecological infrastructure should be maintained and restored in the interests of coastal climate change adaptation. Climate-buffering ecological infrastructure such as wave attenuating reefs and kelp forests and intact coastal dune systems can be safeguarded and restored through improved coastal planning and science-based restoration.\nProgress could be supported through integrated solutions involving biodiversity, society and climate action (key message A1), biodiversity-inclusive co-ordinated coastal and marine spatial planning (key message A2), and strategic restoration guided by robust science (key message B3). Multiple potential indicators of progress in reducing climate risks to people and marine biodiversity have been identified (see priority actions 9 and 10).",

    "text": "Approach\nPressure data are a key input into ecosystem assessments including the assessment of ecosystem condition, ecosystem threat status and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The 2025 marine ecosystem assessment drew largely on the pressure data and information from the previous assessment68, in which Majiedt et al. (2019) comprehensively reviewed and mapped 31 sources of pressure (spatial extent and intensity where feasible) on marine biodiversity in South Africa. These included 19 fisheries sectors, lethal shark control measures, mining, petroleum, shipping, ports and harbours, coastal development, coastal disturbance, mariculture, invasive species, freshwater flow reduction, waste water discharge, dredge material disposal and ammunitions dumping. Climate change literature was reviewed and synthesised60 and invasive species research56 was also considered.\nLimited progress in pressure mapping was achieved for the 2025 assessment but seismic surveys and submarine cables were mapped for inclusion in future assessments and an improved, finer resolution demersal trawl fishing layer was compiled69. Literature reviews and new collaborations to improve research on underwater noise ( Sink et al. 2021, Kirkman research strat? ,26)need to add references once Noku is done helped collate literature, provide insights and identify research priorities for understanding the potential impacts and mitigation options for seismic surveys. The information available in the National Data and Information Report for Marine Spatial Planning provided relevant information in terms of the impacts and mitigation of pressures in the marine realm. Work towards an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for South Africa5 also improved the understanding of pressure on marine biodiversity and was a key informant in the 2025 assessment.",

Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through MPA expansion or other spatial management measures that could be recognised as Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs). In addition to expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, alleviation of pressures and improved ecosystem management.\nFigure 1. Threatened and under-protected marine ecosystem types.\nThe headline indicators of the NBA provide information on the pressures faced by species and ecosystems and on the progress made in protecting them. Combining the indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of marine ecosystems. There are 27 marine ecosystem types that are both highly threatened and under-protected. The highest priorities are the Critically Endangered Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic which is Not Protected and the five ecosystem types that are both Endangered and Not Protected (Table 1). This includes the Orange Cone Muddy Mid Shelf, Cape Lower Canyon, St Helena Bay, Cape Sheltered Rocky Shore and the KZN Bight Mid Shelf Reef Complex. Three ecosystem types are Critically Endangered and Poorly Protected; the Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf, Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge and Cape Bay. Endangered and Poorly Protected ecosystem types include several shore types in the Namaqua, Cape and Agulhas Regions, False and Walker Bay, Western Agulhas Bays, two ecosystem types on the southern KZN shelf and four ecosystem types in the KZN Bight.\nTable 1.

Improved bycatch management (priority action 5) and diversified measures to protect bathers from sharks using non-lethal measures (Improvements in shark control measures) could help improve ecosystem condition in KwaZulu-Natal.\nThere is good progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs1–4, which reveal gaps in participation, cultural heritage protection and governance limiting progress in protection.

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level results\nOf South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, 83% (representing 53.9% of the mainland marine area) are represented in the MPA network to some degree, leaving 27 ecosystem types (17%) as Not Protected (representing 46.1% of the mainland marine area). While the majority of ecosystems have some protection, only 32 ecosystem types (20%), representing 1.4% of the mainland marine area, are Well Protected. It should be noted that changes in relation to the previous assessment1 do not reflect genuine changes in ecosystem protection level, but are due to revised targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. A table of the ecosystem protection level and threat status results can be downloaded from the Data section below.\nSouth Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the Phakisa MPA network. Of the 83 ecosystem types that were Not Protected before 2019, 67 types received their first protection in 2019 with the proclamation of 20 new or expanded MPAs2. These included 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types. Additionally, 18 ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected in 2019, going from a total of 9% to 20%. Since 2019, no new MPAs have been established. However, protection for African penguin foraging areas has been strengthened through fishing closures around six breeding colonies. In addition, new work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), which may help diversify protection models3.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (Figure 3). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. However, while protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves and coastal areas, it should be noted that the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened.\nIncreasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement through collaborative efforts that more effectively address existing pressures. Furthermore, new activities that may conflict with MPA objectives should undergo thorough assessment and only proceed if they are clearly demonstrated to be compatible with conservation goals. Strengthened ecosystem management in protected areas can provide an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected.\nEcosystem types that are Not Protected include the Kingklip Koppies, the vast Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope, the expansive Southwest Indian Lower Slope and four pelagic ecosystem types. Among the latter, the Agulhas Retroflection and Southern Ocean Transitional Water is of particular interest as a globally unique area. The uThukela Canyon, the Cape Lower Canyon and St Helena Bay are also Not Protected.\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons cut into the continental slope off South Africa’s western margin. The Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope and the Cape Lower Canyon are both Not Protected ecosystem types. Coastal communities and small-scale fishers can contribute to offshore protection in South Africa and must be included in participatory processes to support new offshore protection measures. (© SANBI)\n\n\nOf the 27 Poorly Protected ecosystem types, several fall into this category because their areas that are within MPAs have high levels of ecosystem modification (i.e. poor ecological condition due to high past or ongoing pressures), not because they have very limited areas within MPAs. Among others, these include two kelp ecosystem types, Agulhas and Cape Kelp Forests, and two bay ecosystem types, Cape Bay and False and Walker Bay. Other ecosystem types that could advance from their current Poorly Protected status to Moderately Protected by improving ecological condition include Agulhas Mid Shelf Reef, the Agulhas Coarse Sediment Shelf Edge and Amathole Lace Corals.\n\n\n\nAn excellent area to improve protection of the Poorly Protected Eastern Agulhas Outer Shelf Mosaic is in the Seaview Horse Mussel Seabed Management Area near Gqeberha. This area has high biodiversity and Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys found clumps of horse mussels that were not observed in areas with greater inshore trawling activity. (© ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink)\n\n\nForty-eight marine ecosystem types are Moderately Protected. While several of these could advance to Well Protected through improved ecological condition, 27 types will require increased coverage in MPAs or OECMs. For example, Agulhas Boulder Shore, Agulhas Rocky Plateau and Agulhas Upper Canyon require increased representation in South Africa’s marine conservation estate to improve their ecosystem protection level.\n\n\n\nAgulhas Upper Canyon requires increased representation in South Africa’s network of protected and conserved areas to advance to Well Protected. (© Lloyd Edwards and ACEP Deep Secrets and Deep Forests projects)\n\n\nOnly 20% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types are Well Protected. This statistic could be increased through increasing the estate of representative protected areas and by reducing pressures and thereby improving ecological condition within some existing MPAs. Well Protected ecosystem types include many from the Delagoa ecoregion where the iSimangaliso MPA and World Heritage Site provides protection to many ecosystem types. Other examples of Well Protected types include Agulhas Inner Shelf Reef, Natal Exposed Rocky Shore and seamount ecosystem types in the South east Atlantic.\n\n\n\nDelagoa Upper Canyon, which is home to at least 39 individual coelacanths, is a Well Protected ecosystem type.

South Africa’s Marine Protected Area network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, South Africa had 25 coastal MPAs covering less than 0.6% (6 260 km2) of the ocean around South Africa, up from 0.4% (4 711 km2) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly in 2019 and covers 5.4% (51 477 km2) of the ocean around South Africa. A map of the 42 MPAs in South Africa is shown in Figure 4, noting that the Prince Edward Islands MPA in South Africa’s subantarctic territory is the biggest of the South African MPAs and lies more than 1 700 km south of Gqeberha. No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019. Learn more about South Africa’s MPAs at the Marine Protected Areas website.\n\n\nMPA effectiveness\nSouth Africa has made progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of its MPAs4–6. These studies reveal gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity, cultural heritage protection and governance, among other attributes, which limit the ecological gains and effectiveness of the MPA network.\nCommon elements in these evaluations indicate a need to revisit MPA objectives for many MPAs declared before 2019, advance efforts to address historical injustices, strengthen social inclusion and collaboration in the design, implementation and management of protected areas and increase socio-economic research. Innovative transdisciplinary strategies in the co-design of protected and conserved areas and transparent and fair trade-offs in planning are needed7. This will ensure equitable governance and increased tangible benefits for rights holders, knowledge holders and people affected by protected areas4. Closer co-operation with fisheries, heritage and tourism could also deliver more integrated and effective protection7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Tsitsikamma MPA: Ecological gains, historic conflict, and the path toward inclusive governance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tsitsikamma MPA, established in 1964 and covering 340 km², is South Africa’s oldest MPA8. Supporting near-pristine rocky shores9, reef and soft habitats, the area is a breeding ground for chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii)10, and protects endemic, slow-growing seabreams (seabream status page) such as roman (Chrysoblephus laticeps), dageraad (Chyrsoblephus cristiceps), and red steenbras (Petrus rupestris)11, which are heavily fished elsewhere12–15. Populations inside the MPA are more abundant, larger, and have more mature fish than in surrounding fished areas, with linefish such as galjoen (Dichistius capensis), blacktail (Diplodus capensis), and bronze bream (Pachymetopon grande) thriving inside the MPA14,16,17. Adult carpenter (Argyrozona argyrozona) largely remain resident, while their eggs and larvae spill over to neighbouring areas, supporting fisheries outside the reserve16,17.\nHigh-relief, deeper reefs further enhance outcomes, hosting distinct species assemblages, higher biomass, and larger fish than shallower and less complex areas, showing that protecting diverse habitats is critical11. By allowing older, larger fish to persist and reproduce, Tsitsikamma enhances population resilience and spill-over, while also providing long-term research opportunities, tourism benefits, and sustainable fishing benefits.\nAlthough the Tsitsikamma MPA has delivered substantial ecological gains, these successes came with enduring social costs. Established without community consultation, the MPA progressively restricted access from the 1970s and became fully no-take in 200018. Local residents, for whom fishing provided food security, livelihoods, identity, and cultural continuity, experienced these closures as a violation of historical rights and cultural practices19,20. The resulting loss of access generated long-standing frustration, expressed through petitions, protests, and illegal fishing, and contributed to deep mistrust between communities and the conservation authority.\nThese tensions were intensified by governance processes widely viewed as top-down, with limited stakeholder engagement20,21. Multiple attempts to reopen access in the 2000s failed, fuelling further conflict. The 2016 rezoning, which opened 20% of the coastline to registered local fishers (rod and line fishing from the shore), sought to restore access and address past injustices. However, the process was criticised for being rushed, insufficiently inclusive, and misaligned with scientific advice18,20. Scientists, NGOs, and some community members raised concerns about decision-making transparency, the representativity of stakeholder input, and potential ecological consequences.\nWhile relationships have improved since rezoning, access alone cannot resolve the deeper governance challenges that shaped the conflict. The literature highlights that enduring tensions relate to issues of recognition, trust, values, and equitable involvement in decision-making20,21. Without governance arrangements that meaningfully include communities, acknowledge historical context, and create shared authority, the MPA risks continued social contestation and missed opportunities for socially just and ecologically effective conservation.\n\n\n\nThis MPA is a valuable national asset due its long-term protection. The MPA was established to protect the rich diversity of marine life found in the area including mammals, invertebrates and fish. Cape clawless otter (© Peter Chadwick); dramatic cliffs and rugged rocks (© Peter Chadwick); roman (© Steve Benjamin); deep water corals (© Geoff Spiby).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOECMs\nThe concept of OECMs offers new opportunities for more inclusive and people-centred approaches to marine conservation that can encourage and support resource co-management, diverse cultural values, livelihoods and enhanced sustainability, while reducing the burden on MPA expansion in South Africa4. These areas are governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity values, whether or not biodiversity conservation is the primary management objective. No marine areas have been recognised as OECMs in South Africa as of December, 2025.\nExploratory assessments of various management measures that exist in the marine realm allowed for the identification of measures that hold most promise for OECM recognition. These included a marine buffer zone of a biosphere reserve, closed fishing areas adjacent to African penguin colonies, and estuaries with estuarine management plans. Going forward, it may be strategic to prioritise sites under the above measures for formal assessment against OECM criteria.\n\n\n\nRemotely Operated Vehicle surveys within the trawl closure off Cape St Francis suggest that this area meets the OECM criterion for high biodiversity value. This site, if recognised as an OECM, could contribute to improved ecosystem protection level for the Endangered and Moderately Protected Eastern Agulhas Bay. (© ACEP Deep Forests, Kerry Sink)\n\n\nThere are certain measures that South Africa’s legislation makes provision for but are yet to be implemented, which could meet the criteria for OECM recognition, depending on where and how they are implemented. An example is Special Management Areas under the National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act. Sites under this measure can be designated primarily for cultural purposes and could potentially constitute OECMs that uphold cultural sustainability, promote the connection of people with their environment and heritage, and facilitate greater inclusivity in marine conservation and management in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Culturally Significant Areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Sites such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation relevance and recognition as OECMs in partnership with value holders. (© Kerry Sink)\n\n\nNew research22 has supported progress in identifying and characterising Culturally Significant Areas for inclusion in Marine Spatial Planning and coastal management. Eight categories of Culturally Significant Areas were identified drawing from literature, orature and expert knowledge22. These cover tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage, including iconic seascapes, traditional fishing grounds, sites of spiritual and ceremonial importance and oral tradition. Spatial management in alignment with OECM criteria could help to safeguard the deep and diverse cultural ties many South Africans have to the coastal and marine environment. The establishment of small scale fishing zones, a provision under the Marine Living Resources Act, could also be explored as a mechanism for OECM recognition, providing protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding marine ecosystems and cultural heritage23.\nImproving marine ecosystem protection requires strategic collaborative expansion of protected and conserved areas, but also actions to improve ecosystem condition and compliance in existing MPAs, including co-management and redress where historical injustices persist.",

    "text": "Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Schematic to illustrate steps in determining marine ecosystem protection level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history and approach to the development of South Africa’s protection level assessment is provided on the ecosystem protection level explainer page and will be published24. The 2025 ecosystem protection level assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets (Figure 5). While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% marine target with an additional rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target for all ecosystem types. When calculating the percentage of area within an MPA, the area contributions were scaled by condition to account for the fact that areas of high modification do not contribute to an ecosystem’s protection level as much as areas of natural condition. The protection contribution was scaled in alignment with the IUCN RLE criteria C and D thresholds of modification. Further, in order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify for the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nChanges in ecosystem protection level between 2018 and 2025 are caused by the increased target and improved methodology rather than genuine changes in protection or ecological condition. Note that OECMs will contribute to ecosystem protection level once these have been recognised in the marine realm3,23.\nRecent evaluations of ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness for existing MPAs were synthesised to distil key findings beyond the spatial analysis of ecosystem protection level. Synergies in underlying themes related to effectiveness and in recommendations to improve effectiveness or the evaluation thereof were identified. An analysis of stakeholder comments that was undertaken to inform future MPA expansion efforts was also consulted25 and the work undertaken through the iAtlantic project26,27, Mission Atlantic project28, the ACEP Deep Connections and One Ocean Hub projects29 including the Aliwal Shoal Working Group30, and SeaPeople31 were additional key informants. Inputs from an additional workshop that discussed the draft results of the 2025 marine assessment and co-developed recommended priority actions, also provided useful insights32–34.",

Critically modified areas were included in the heavily modified category in this assessment. In South Africa’s marine environment, critically modified components are only present in some shore ecosystem types, where (coastal development or ports) infrastructure has caused irreversible habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

However, ecosystem modification tends to be focused in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources (such as bays, inner shelf and shelf edge areas), while large and often remote areas remain relatively lightly used and unmodified. Deepwater biogenic beds, bays and kelp forests have the highest proportion of ecosystem modification in terms of their extent (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Groundtruthing ecological condition\nFew cumulative impact studies validate their assessments of ecological condition, and groundtruthing ecological condition was a recommendation of the 2018 NBA. Smit et al. (2023) identified suitable indicators for condition assessments and defined reference conditions for rocky reef ecosystems, an important step in ecosystem assessment2. Subsequently, Smit et al. (2024) used rocky reef ecological data to compare reference conditions from well established MPAs against sites with varying cumulative pressures. This was later expanded to over ten MPAs spanning three ecoregions to assess functional diversity patterns at a broader scale3.\nResults showed that ecological condition was significantly but weakly correlated with NBA cumulative impact scores, with notable discrepancies at finer scales, where some reefs were in better condition than predicted while others were worse (Smit et al. 2024). The cumulative impact scores performed better as a proxy for the condition of fish communities than for benthic communities4. Although the cumulative impact map was an effective proxy at broad scales, the findings highlighted the need for finer-scale pressure mapping and ecological data to improve ecological condition maps and support more accurate spatial assessments.\n\n\n\nHighly protected zones within MPAs can be used as reference areas to support the calibration of ecological condition.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nEcological condition in the marine realm is assessed by intersecting the spatial maps of pressures on biodiversity with the ecosystem map by following the approach shown in Figure 4. The assessment used the individual and combined impact of 31 mapped pressures5 to assess ecological condition through the development of an ecosystem-pressure matrix1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Schematic illustrating how ecological condition is mapped in the marine realm.\n\n\n\nTo develop the ecosystem-pressure matrix, expert scoring of ‘functional impact’ and ‘recovery’ is conducted by experts supported by a synthesis of information on pressures on marine biodiversity, using a guided group consensus method approach that was adapted from Teck et al. (2010)6, to develop impact scores per activity for each ecosystem functional group1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Scoring of functional impact and recovery as part of an ecosystem-pressure matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Functional impact’ is a broad evaluation of the degree to which the natural state of any given ecosystem (including constituent species, community structure, physical habitat structure and ecosystem function) is impacted by a specific pressure. This component incorporates the issue of spatial scale or extent of a single act of an activity (pressure event), and impacts on trophic structure of communities. Experts evaluated the functional impact of a specific pressure to each broad ecosystem group, based on their knowledge, the support of international and local literature, and guided by the 0-10 scale in Table 2.\n‘Recovery’ is a measure of the time required for the ecosystem (including affected species, physical habitat structure, and community trophic structure) to return to a natural state following cessation of disturbance by a given activity. As above, experts evaluated the recovery based on their knowledge, the support of literature, and guided by the 0-10 scale in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Scoring guidelines used in the assessment of functional impact and recovery, as adapted from Teck et al. (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nFunctional impact\nRecovery\n\n\n\n\n0\nNo impact.\nN/A\n\n\n1\nMinor impact limited to a single species with minimal impact on overall system functioning.\nVery quick recovery (&lt; 1 year).\n\n\n2\nMinor impact limited to a few (&lt; 10) species with minimal impact on overall system functioning.\nQuick recovery (&gt; 1 year but &lt; 2 years).\n\n\n5\nModerate impact on natural state of ecosystems, including impacts on a range of species and some impacts on trophic structure. May include localised physical habitat damage.\nAverage recovery time (&gt; 2 year but &lt; 5 years).\n\n\n8\nHigh impact on natural state of an ecosystem (including habitat and/or changes in trophic structure).\nSlow recovery time (&gt; 5 year but &lt; 10 years).\n\n\n10\nExtremely heavy impact on the natural state of an ecosystem (including major changes in trophic structure and/or damage to physical structure).\nVery slow recovery (&gt; 10 years) or permanent damage (e.g. irreversible changes in habitat or trophic structure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact scores were calculated using a combination of the functional impact and recovery scores and scaled to values between 0 and 100. Draft values of impact score components were iteratively refined and updated with guidance of key specialists with local knowledge, until consensus values were obtained1.\nIndividual pressure impact layers were developed by combining the ecosystem-pressure matrix with the pressure intensity layer and ecosystem map to produce maps showing the impact of each activity across the seascape. In this way, each pixel of the pressure impact layer represents the extent to which the ecosystem type that exists there is impacted by the type and intensity of the pressure.\n\nA map of cumulative impact was calculated by summing all the individual pressure impact layers by calculating the sum of their scores at each location (pixel)1. The resultant map represents the cumulative impact to the ecosystem type in each pixel, based on the type and intensity of all pressures recorded at that location.\nTo develop a map of ecosystem condition, the cumulative impact layer scores were divided into four condition categories (Box 1) that align with the four categories of degradation or disruption in criteria C and D of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems methodology1.\nIt must be clarified that although the assessment was conducted using 30 x 30 m pixels, this does not imply that the ecosystem map or the results are accurate to this resolution. This high resolution was used to enable calculations at a sufficiently fine scale while accommodating the unique combinations of multiple pressures, pressure intensities, impacts and ecosystem types. The 30 x 30 m pixels reflect the units used for the numerical calculations, whereas the spatial accuracy is linked to the underlying accuracy of the ecosystem map and the pressure mapping. Improved finer-scale ecosystem and pressure mapping is a key priority for future assessments.\nSmit et al. (2023, 2024, 2026)3,4,7 made progress in field-based evaluations of site condition. This work must be expanded to other ecosystem functional groups. Such studies can be used to calibrate the cumulative impact scores and the classification thresholds used to assign condition categories. Further work is needed to investigate the use of different thresholds, ideally guided by field surveys that assess ecological condition indices.\nPotential future improvements to the ecological condition mapping process include:\n• Revise scoring of impact and recovery scores with new literature and greater international collaboration.\n• Refine scoring guidelines and definitions for greater clarity and reproducibility.\n• Develop different cumulative impact layers for different ecological condition assessment components (e.g. benthic, pelagic, ongoing decline versus pressures that have stopped, abiotic vs biotic degradation). These should be tailored to align with IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria.\n• Apply learnings from research that can inform ecological condition thresholds.\n• Increase knowledge on reference states of marine ecosystems for a diversity of indicators and a broader range of ecosystem functional groups.\n• Continue to test and validate indicators for condition assessments under a variety of, and multiple, pressures.\n• Explore application of critically modified category in the marine realm (beyond shores) and its relationship to potentially novel or anthropogenic ecosystem types as defined by the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.\n• Increase alignment of condition categories across realms.",

    "text": "Key findings\n\nSouth Africa has a rich diversity of spider species, with 2 265 described species1, representing 4% of the world’s spiders.\nA comprehensive assessment of 2 214 spider species was conducted for the first time between 2016 and 2019 using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria to classify their risk of extinction; and represents a global first and a pioneering effort in applying IUCN Red List criteria to a mega-diverse invertebrate group2.\nThe spider assessment was made possible through the 22-year South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA) initiative, which resulted in significant improvements to the knowledge base: a 33% increase in described species and, during this project, a 350% rise in specimen accessions in the national collection.\nOf the assessed species, only 78 of the species (4%) were assessed as threatened.\nMost species (1 419 spp., 64%) are widely distributed with no known threats and are assessed as Least Concern.\nImportantly, almost a third of the species (707 spp., 32%) are assessed as Data Deficient, meaning that a large number of species need further research before their risk of extinction can be determined.\nEndemism is high, with 1 303 species (58%) found only in South Africa, representing ~2% of the world’s spiders.\nIn the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) assessment, spiders currently have the highest RLI score of all South African taxonomic groups, making them appear the least threatened. However, many species remain unevaluated due to limited information. As a result, their true status is uncertain – more species may prove to be threatened, or many may be Least Concern. This uncertainty means the current RLI value should be interpreted with caution.\nThe major threats to spiders are habitat loss due to fire, overgrazing, invasive plants, mining, agricultural practices, and urban development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Threat status\nIn 2016, South Africa assessed 2 214 spider species for the first time using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, which measure extinction risk2. Only South African species were included; Eswatini and Lesotho were excluded from the assessment. Of the assessed species, 78 (4%) were threatened with extinction: 23 are Critically Endangered (CR), 24 are Endangered (EN), and 31 are Vulnerable (VU). No species were found to be extinct or possibly extinct.\nHighly threatened spiders occur in the three major urban centres of South Africa (Western Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal major metropolitan areas). This could be an indication of sample bias, but also identifies areas that have lost large areas of habitat to urban expansion (Figure 1). Some species have very restricted ranges yet face no anthropogenic threats. These are listed under South Africa’s national rarity categories: Rare (extent of occurrence &lt;500 km²) or Critically Rare (known from a single location). Sixteen spider species were classified as Critically Rare and 44 species as Rare. Although such species qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system, they remain a priority for national conservation and are included as taxa of conservation concern along with threatened, Near Threatened and Data Deficient species.\nMost species (1 419; 63%) are widespread, face no known threats, and are assessed as Least Concern (Figure 2). A large proportion (675; 30%) are Data Deficient, highlighting the need for more research, particularly providing more detailed taxonomic descriptions, describing unknown sexes and providing additional distribution data through field sampling and examination of museum material (see Box 1).\nEndemism is high, with 1 325 species (59%) found only in South Africa, representing 2% of global spider diversity. Of the 72 spider families recorded, Salticidae (jumping spiders) is the most species-rich (354), followed by Gnaphosidae (195) and Thomisidae (143)1. Because of its size, Salticidae also has the highest number of threatened (6) and Data Deficient (98) species.\nHowever, the greatest conservation concern lies with smaller, cryptic species in isolated habitats such as caves and fragmented habitats. Families such as Pholcidae, Archaeidae, and Corinnidae each include four threatened species. Families with the highest numbers of Rare or Critically Rare species are Pholcidae (18), Salticidae (5) and Drymusidae (4)2.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA) was initiated in 1997, with the main aim of documenting the arachnid fauna of South Africa at a national level and to unify and strengthen biodiversity research on the spiders of South Africa3. SANSA was managed by the Arachnida Unit at the National Collection of Arachnida (NCA) at the Agricultural Research Council - Plant Health and Protection (ARC-PHP) unit in Pretoria, with support from the Universities of the Free State and Venda, the National Museum in Bloemfontein, and the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) Threatened Species Programme, who funded SANSA Phase 23.\nThe primary objective of the SANSA Phase 1 (1997–2005) was to consolidate all existing spider data into a MySQL relational database developed at the ARC. The study of South African spiders was significantly influenced by colonial expansion and the visits of scientists, who dispatched hundreds of specimens to museums in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The data date back to 1781, when the first species was described from South Africa. Records of all known South African species and their distribution information were extracted from original descriptions, re-descriptions and revisionary work, as listed on the World Spider Catalogue. SANBI joined the project for its second phase, known as SANSA II, from 2006 to 2010. Gap analyses were done to determine the spatial coverage of the species, and targeted surveys were undertaken in degree-squares throughout South Africa, particularly in areas with poor historic coverage. Due to extensive fieldwork by SANSA field managers and research from other projects, student projects and public participation, more than 40 degree-squares were sampled in previously poorly sampled areas, providing valuable material that improved our knowledge of species distributions and yielding valuable specimens for future taxonomic studies. In 2010, the First Atlas of South African Spiders (FASSA) was published online, listing 2003 species from 70 families, with georeferenced records and distribution maps4. The last decade, however, has seen considerable growth in the knowledge of spiders in South Africa, and the number of species known from the country has increased to 2 265 species1. Dr Dippenaar-Schoeman still continues to work on the SANSA project as the project manager, updating taxonomy, even after retiring from the ARC-PHP.\n\nThe National Collection of Arachnida - The cabinets housing the specimens in the National Collection of Arachnida.

    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using a global standard indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) of species5. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List status over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct. The RLI value for spiders in South Africa was calculated in 2020 and included 2 214 species. The RLI value is 0.994, and relative to other taxon groups assessed in South Africa, spiders have the highest RLI value (Figure 3). Since only one assessment has been conducted for spiders, it is not possible to determine the trend in extinction risk for this group. Important to note, many Data Deficient species are included in the assessment, and hence there is still a high level of uncertainty associated with this result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for spider species assessed in South Africa, relative to national aggregate (national average across all assessed taxonomic groups). The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species are becoming more threatened over time. The steeper the slope, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). Spiders are indicated in yellow and have a relatively high RLI value when compared with the national average, indicating that levels of extinction risk are low. However, many spiders were assessed as Data Deficient, that are not included in this calculation.",

    "section": "Pressures",
    "text": "Pressures\nSpiders face an array of threats – both natural and human-driven (Figure 4). Research has shown that habitat loss caused by fire (see Box 2), overgrazing and invasive alien species infestations has a direct impact on spider populations, causing local losses3. Urban expansion, agriculture, forestry, and mining are the leading causes of habitat loss for spiders. These pressures are especially important for ground-dwelling and endemic species with poor dispersal abilities. In South Africa, many spider species are highly localised and endemic to specific biomes, such as the Fynbos6 with 28% endemic species to this biome, and the Savanna7 with 30% of the species endemic. Ground-dwelling spiders are particularly vulnerable to changes in their habitat and often struggle to recolonise areas after disturbance due to their limited dispersal capabilities, making them more prone to local extinction.\nSpiders are present in relatively high numbers in agroecosystems; however, it has been shown that they are negatively impacted by pesticide use8. Thus far, 51 families from 413 species have been recorded from crops in South Africa, and five agrobiont species have been identified that play an important role as natural control agents of agricultural pests. However, chemical use can directly kill spiders or disrupt their prey base. Integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming are recommended to reduce chemical exposure that harms spiders and their prey. Altered temperature and rainfall patterns (likely from climate change) can affect spider distribution, reproduction, and prey availability, and they may be severely impacted by drought.\nSome spiders are threatened due to poaching and are used as pets, for example, the species in the Theraphosidae family (baboon spiders). Baboon spiders (family Theraphosidae) are ecologically significant predators within South African ecosystems, contributing to the regulation of a variety of insect species’ populations9. However, baboon spiders face increasing threats from illegal collection for the exotic pet trade, driven by their popularity among arachnid enthusiasts and their slow life history traits, such as long lifespans and low reproductive rates4,9. Although national legislation provides protection for baboon spiders, enforcement remains inconsistent, and improved regulatory measures are essential to prevent unsustainable harvesting and ensure the persistence of these species in their natural habitats9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s spider taxa, based on the percentage of impacted threatened and Near threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Spider species’ ability to respond to fire events, a natural ecological process that is expected to become much more frequent and unpredictable in a changing climate\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the studies of spider ecology in South Africa are local-scale studies focusing on spider assemblage responses to habitat complexity, landscape-scale variables, ecosystem rehabilitation and plant invasions, and disturbance effects such as fire11, grazing12, invasive plants13 and chemical control14.\nFire is a factor that can significantly impact spider populations, but its effects vary depending on the species, habitat, and intensity of the fire. Many foliage-dwelling spiders perish during fires due to direct exposure to heat and flames, while some ground-dwellers that remain in their burrows (particularly trapdoor spiders) and those that seek shelter under rocks or in cracks in the soil are less impacted. Due to habitat disruption, fire alters leaf litter, vegetation and microhabitats that spiders rely on for shelter and hunting. A study in central South African grasslands found that fast-burning spring fires resulted in an immediate sharp decline in ground-dwelling spider numbers, but that assemblages recovered to levels comparable to unburnt sites within a year. Burnt sites had significantly fewer individuals and species compared to unburnt ones. Some families, such as Lycosidae (wolf spiders) and Gnaphosidae (ground spiders), persisted post-fire, while others declined. Caponiidae (lungless spiders) were the only group found to increase in burnt areas. Studies have shown a decline in overall spider numbers after fire events. There are species-specific responses, and web builders (such as orb and sheet weavers) are more vulnerable and often absent after a fire, while ground hunters and ambush predators tend to be more resilient. Some spiders can recolonise burned areas relatively quickly, depending on the severity of the fire and the condition of the surrounding habitat. Fires that burn unevenly leave refuges that aid in faster recovery11.\n\nVeld fire in the Grassland and Savannah systems. (© Robin Lyle)",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nA significant portion of the South African spider fauna remains undescribed. In the Cape Floristic Region, 24% of species are classified as Data Deficient, and two families (Synotaxidae and Theridiosomatidae) are only known from undescribed species. Studies on mygalomorph trapdoor spiders (e.g., Stasimopus, Ancylotrypa, Galeosoma) show taxonomic resolution as low as 15–29%, indicating high uncertainty in species delimitation.\nSampling bias and geographic gaps are a concern. Spider records are heavily concentrated in the eastern and coastal regions of South Africa, with North West, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga province remaining undersampled1,2,15. These sampling biases impede conservation assessments and ecological modelling. Making use of citizen science to contribute to observations, both helps fill sampling gaps and also raises awareness (see Box 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Calling all citizen scientists!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo contribute to the future Red List assessments and monitoring of spiders, join iNaturalist!\n\nSpiders of South Africa iNaturalist\n\n New to iNaturalist (or never heard of it) and want to play along? Watch these video tutorials to get started, and sign up on the iNaturalist website or download the app on your smartphone.\nTo see how valuable your nature photographs can be, watch this inspiring TED talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphological variation is poorly understood due to limited sampling, making it difficult to confidently define species boundaries. Despite SANSA’s efforts, many natural history collections lack comprehensive coverage or standardised metadata, limiting their utility for taxonomic synthesis, as large numbers of specimens in collections remain unidentified due to a lack of spider taxonomists. For example, a recent meta-analysis of South African spider data from seven collections found that only slightly more than half of the ~121 000 records had been identified to species level, indicating a major taxonomic gap in the available data15. Presently, there is only one spider taxonomist employed at a natural history collection. The shortage of taxonomic expertise will have direct consequences for resolving Data Deficient taxa and developing taxonomic products related to species descriptions, revisions, and the integration of molecular tools.\nAddressing the taxonomic impediment for spiders in South Africa requires a multi-pronged strategy that blends capacity building, infrastructure development, and policy integration. The following is a breakdown of suggested solutions:\n\nExpansion of taxonomic capacity by creating employment for specialist taxonomists and providing the required skills transfer opportunities (see Box 4).\nAccelerate species descriptions through building capacity and collaborative research, particularly with international partners.\nIntegrate molecular tools and promote DNA barcoding and phylogenetics to resolve species boundaries, especially in morphologically conservative groups.\nDevelop a national spider barcode reference library linked to voucher specimens and ecological metadata. Currently, sequence data on South African spiders (~10  600 specimens processed, mainly COI-5P) is scattered among several projects with very contrasting levels of taxonomic resolution.\nDigitize and standardise collections with high-resolution imaging, georeferencing, and standardised metadata.\nSupport the evolution of natural science collection databases to be more accessible by improving the use of centralized database accessible to researchers, conservationists, and policy-makers.\nEncourage citizen science platforms like iNaturalist to crowdsource observations and expand distribution data (see Box 3).\nRelax permit conditions so that members of the public can sample specimens without fear of prosecution, particularly those linked to photographic observations, to enable species-level identifications.\nLink taxonomic work to spatial tools for species conservation, e.g. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and the DFFE Environmental Screening Tool for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), to justify funding and urgency. This can be further linked to understanding biodiversity data and the role it could play in South Africa’s biosecurity with regards to emerging pests and diseases.\nFoster international collaboration and partner with global arachnological networks for training, data sharing, and joint revisions.\nInvite and fund visiting taxonomists to work on South African material and co-author species descriptions.\nFacilitate the training of taxonomists from other African countries to expand the skills base on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Profile on Data Deficient spiders of South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough South Africa has the richest described spiders on the continent, some researched thoroughly in the past, many families have never been subjected to revision and continue to present a considerable identification challenge to taxonomists and ecologists alike. Surveys and research have shown that a large proportion of species remain undescribed in several families. For example, the National Collection of Arachnida has around 45% of specimens that are still unidentified.\nPreliminary research on the following families reveals that many species remain unidentified.

    "text": "Approach\nThe first IUCN Red List assessment of South African spiders was conducted between 2016 and 2019, as a collaborative project between the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), the Agricultural Research Council, the University of the Free State and the University of Venda (formerly University of Limpopo). This assessment represents a pioneering effort in applying IUCN Red List criteria to a mega-diverse invertebrate group and was made possible through the 22-year South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA) initiative, which resulted in significant improvements to the knowledge base: a 33% increase in described species and a 350% rise in specimen accessions in the ARC’s National Collection of Arachnida (NCA).\nData sources and methods\nThe assessment utilised data from the First Atlas of South African Spiders4, which compiled information from two primary sources: the National Collection of Arachnida (NCA) at the Agricultural Research Council – Plant Health and Protection (ARC-PHP) in Roodeplaat, Pretoria (with over 60 000 records) and published taxonomic literature from 17 museum collections.\nThe distribution of occurrence records across South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini was visualised using quarter-degree, degree-square and density kernel plots for all 76 069 records. However, records in the NCA that were not identified to species level were excluded from the Red List assessments, reducing the analytical dataset to 23,827 species-level records covering 2 253 known South African spider species.\nCalculation of parameters\nThe calculation of Red List parameters was performed using the R package red (v1.6.3)16. Spatial analyses on observed occurrences used functions for calculating Extent of Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and elevational range. EOO was calculated as the minimum convex polygon around all occurrences, while AOO was determined by the number of 2 km² cells occupied. When EOOs were smaller than the AOO, they were made equal. Assessments were drafted as per the IUCN documentation standards and reviewed by relevant experts.\nAssessment criteria and limitations\nNotably, all Red List assessments relied exclusively on IUCN criteria B (geographic range) or D (population size), as these could be evaluated from available distribution data and inferred threats. The other IUCN criteria (A, C, and E) require empirical evidence of population dynamics and trends – a critical data gap known as the Prestonian shortfall – which remains unavailable for most spider species. This methodological constraint highlights the need for long-term monitoring programs to provide insights into population dynamics.",

    "text": "Overview of diversity\nSharks, rays and chimaeras (hereafter ‘sharks’) are members of the diverse class of cartilaginous fishes that includes the sharks, rays, skates, sawfishes and chimaeras (or ghost sharks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTo understand more about the classification of sharks, rays and chimaeras, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharks, rays, skates, wedgefishes (also known as guitarfishes), sawfishes and chimaeras are collectively known as cartilaginous fishes – which simply means that they are fishes with a skeleton composed of cartilage, or chondrichthyans which refers to their membership of the Class Chondrichthyes. As such, they are distinct from bony fishes (Class Osteichthyes). Scientists generally recognise three main groups: sharks, rays (typically referred to as batoids in scientific circles) and chimeras. Sharks and rays are grouped together in the subclass Elasmobranchii, but chimeras (including rabbitfishes, elephantfishes, ghost sharks and spook fishes) are grouped in their own subclass, the Holocephali. The rays or batoids, affectionately known as ‘flat sharks’, include more than 30 families with main groups including the electric rays, stingrays and relatives, skates, and the guitarfishes and sawfishes. Everywhere else on this webpage, this entire group is referred to as sharks because all these different species (sharks, rays, skates and chimaeras) are often grouped together in common language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. South Africa’s Diverse Shark Assemblage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa hosts one of the richest and most diverse shark assemblages in the world. Globally, there are approximately 1 266 species, of which 191 are found in South African waters, including 13 endemic species1. This assemblage represents important ecological and cultural values as well as commercial value2.\nSouth Africa’s sharks range in size from the happy Eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsii) at up to 60 cm to the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) at up to 6 meters total length.\nSome shark species, such as the happy eddy, are resident, spending their entire life cycles in South African waters; whereas others, such as the white shark, are highly mobile and may face significant threats well beyond South African waters.\nSharks occupy a diversity of habitats from estuaries and shallow coastal waters (including sandy and muddy seabeds, coral and rocky reefs, and kelp forests) to deeper offshore waters (including both benthic habitats and the pelagic zone).\nSharks perform a range of essential ecological functions – as apex and meso-predators in many marine foodwebs, they often control the populations of their prey, maintaining diversity at lower trophic levels; while large benthic rays, can serve as habitat engineers and important bioturbators, making oxygen and buried nutrients available to other organisms3. The importance of sharks in maintaining well-functioning coastal and marine ecosystems cannot be overemphasised4.\nUnfortunately, many shark species have slow life histories – they are long-lived but slow growing and late maturing with low reproductive rates. These characteristics combine to make shark populations inherently vulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover following depletion.\nSpecies with small geographic ranges in nearshore and coastal habitats are also especially vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation, and some appear to be undergoing climate-induced range shifts that may reduce their geographic range still further.\nIn Global Priorities for Conserving Sharks and Rays: A 2015–2025 Strategybrautigam2015a?, South Africa was identified as a priority country for saving shark species, based on an analysis of species richness; threat; levels of endemism; and likelihood of conservation success.",

A further 20 species (10%) are categorised as Near Threatened, while 18 (9%) are classified as Data Deficient (i.e. have insufficient information to determine whether they are threatened or not), so the true number of threatened species could be even higher. 71 species (37%) are categorised as Least Concern. Six (46%) of the 13 endemic species were assessed as threatened. Responsibility for the conservation and recovery of these six species lies in South Africa’s hands.\nFor the 33 species assessed at the national level, one species is assessed as likely more threatened at the national than global level,11 species are assessed as less threatened at the national than global level (including five species that are globally Threatened but nationally Least Concern), and the remaining 21 species have the same threat status at global and national levels. These results indicate that South Africa’s efforts to manage fisheries for some target and bycatch species are having significant positive impacts, while the overall status assessment (43% of South Africa’s sharks listed as Threatened) shows that much more still needs to be done to prevent extinctions and foster recovery.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

As most of South Africa’s 191 shark species have ranges that extend well beyond South African waters, some of the decline in the RLI for South Africa’s sharks reflects intense fishing pressure and other threats beyond South Africa’s jurisdiction. When national adjustments in threat status are taken into account, the overall national status of South Africa’s sharks is marginally better than their global status and the decline in the national RLI is marginally less steep than the global RLI for the same set of species (Figure 2). As for the overall threat status, these results indicate that South Africa’s efforts to manage fisheries for some target and bycatch species are having significant positive impacts, but that much more still needs to be done to prevent extinctions and foster recovery.",

    "text": "Pressures\nOverfishing is the main threat to sharks globally6 and in South Africa (Figure 3). Overfishing has been identified as a major threat on the IUCN Red List for all of South Africa’s threatened shark species and is the sole major threat identified for two thirds of those species. This includes targeted catch in some commercial fisheries, plus bycatch in commercial fisheries targeting more productive species, recreational fisheries, and lethal shark control measures, and ghost fishing by abandoned fishing gear.\nTotal catch of sharks across all fisheries is in the order of 1 000 tonnes per annum4. Domestic consumption of shark meat and fins in South Africa is limited – most of the documented catch is exported to markets in Asia and Latin America.\nOf shark species landed in South African fisheries, 24% are Critically Endangered (Table 3) or Endangered. Two of these species have estimated annual catches (2013-2023) in excess of 100 tonnes7: soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus, CR) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus, EN). An additional four Endangered species had estimated average annual catches (2013-2023) of 11 tonnes or more7: dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus, EN), the endemic twineye skate (Raja ocellifera, EN), spearnose skate (Rostroraja alba, EN), and common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus, EN) (Table 2). For most of these species (the exception being the spearnose skate), overfishing is the sole pressure. Catches are very low for five of the Critically Endangered or Endangered species landed in South African fisheries4.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, approximately two thirds of the reported shark catch in southern Africa was bycatch8. While some bycatch is retained and sold, much unwanted bycatch is discarded at sea. Mortality rates are high for many bycatch species, especially if they are neglected while on deck. Bycatch discarded at sea is effectively unrecorded and unregulated4.\nRecreational fisheries continue for some shark species – while fishers may choose catch-and-release, post-release mortality rates are high for some species (e.g., the Critically Endangered scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini)) due to high capture stress.\nThe lethal shark control programme in KwaZulu-Natal (shark nets nad baited drum lines) targets large sharks and represents an additional pressure on target and bycatch species. Currently, the programme is responsible for 2.4% of South Africa’s total shark catch4. The lethal shark control programme is the main pressure in South Africa for the Critically Endangered great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and the Endangered sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), and also takes the Critically Endangered scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). While some individuals are released alive, some species (such as hammerheads) have high capture stress and are unlikely to survive. See marine pressure page, box on lethal shark control measures\n\n\n\nBoth the longfin mako (Isurus paucus) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) sharks are assessed as Endangered, with average annual landings of the shortfin mako estimated at 11 tonnes or more. (© Steve Benjamin)\n\n\nSouth African fisheries are well developed, with a high degree of industrialisation8. Threats to sharks, rays and chimeras associated with small-scale fisheries are likely lower in South Africa than in some other coastal countries in the region.\nPressure from illegal gillnet fisheries in estuaries and the open sea along the entire South African continental margin is growing, representing an increasing threat to both legal fisheries and sharks7. In some areas, catches and landings of sharks in illegal gillnets at sea likely exceed landings from legal gillnets7. The illegal gillnet fishery is characterised by exceptionally high bycatch, especially when nets are set in estuaries and other nursery areas7.\n\n\n\nThe St Joseph (Callorhynchus capensis) is also known as the ploughnose chimaera or elephantfish. Although this is a fisheries target species, it is assessed as Least Concern. (© Geoff Spiby, Two Oceans Aquarium)\n\n\nWhile South Africa’s industrial fisheries are well managed and various measures are in place to reduce pressure on threatened species, many sharks are highly mobile and face more intense fishing pressure when they leave South African waters, including unregulated and illegal fishing (Pollom et al. 2024).\nOne quarter of South Africa’s threatened shark species are threatened by habitat loss and degradation attributed to coastal development and pollution (link to Pressures in the marine realm). This is major threat for many geographically restricted and ecologically specialised species that depend on nearshore and coastal ecosystems such as estuaries, mangroves and seagrass beds (including several threatened endemic species, Table 2). Even broadly distributed highly mobile species typically depend on particular sites and habitats for some life-cycle processes, such as breeding and feeding, and may be vulnerable to degradation of those habitats.\nThe effects of climate change are difficult to determine, but one fifth of South Africa’s threatened shark species are considered threatened by climate-driven habitat loss or range shifts. Climate pressure may be mediated through direct impacts on habitat loss (e.g., loss of coral reef habitat through bleaching for the Critically Endangered shorttail nurse shark, Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) or through range shifts in response to changing ocean temperatures and other oceanographic variables that can lead to significant habitat loss for geographically restricted and ecologically specialised species, including several of South Africa’s threatened endemic species (Table 2) (see also Pollom et al. 2024).\nFocus on South Africa’s threatened endemic shark species\nThe main threat identified for the six threatened endemic species is fisheries – two species are subject to target catch effort, while all six are taken as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species (Table 2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Major pressures on South Africa’s six threatened endemic shark species as reflected in the global IUCN Red List Assessments.

Some of the pressures shown in Figure 3 may not be prevalent in South Africa. Table 3 summarises the pressures on 12 Critically Endangered shark species, focusing on pressures in South African waters. The Critically Endangered soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus) still faces pressure from fisheries removals of more than 100 tonnes in South Africa alone.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

    "text": "Addressing Pressures\nManagement measures are essential to address key threats to sharks, prevent overfishing and halt the progressive decline of shark populations towards extinction. Such measures can support the conservation and recovery of South Africa’s shark biodiversity, maintain livelihoods based on sustainable fisheries, and ensure that sharks continue to play their critical roles in maintaining well-functioning coastal and marine ecosystems. These measures are all part of South Africa’s commitment to the global community to address biodiversity loss through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, especially Target 4 (halting species extinctions), Target 5 (sustainable use of wild species, preventing overexploitation), Target 9 (sustainable management of wild species for the benefit of people) and Target 2 (restoration of degraded ecosystems). See Priority actions in the marine chapter for more information\nGood data collection and data management are essential for effective fisheries management. There are essentially three types of measures for addressing pressures on sharks:\n\nspatial management measures (e.g., marine protected areas (MPAs), other effective area-based measures (OECMs), and other special protection measures designed to safeguard sharks and their habitat within a delineated space);\nfisheries-wide measures, usually applied to all vessels or permit-holders within a particular fleet (e.g., entry permits, catch limits, size limits, gear restrictions, catch-and-release protocols, trade restrictions).\nMeasures to restore water quality and quantity (see key message A7)\n\nAll types of measures are needed to safeguard sharks and support sustainable fisheries, and all measures require monitoring and enforcement to be effective4.\nSouth Africa has made significant progress in addressing threats to sharks, including through the following measures:\nData collection and analysis:\n\nFisheries-independent surveys, catch and effort data collection in various fisheries, analysis of population trends and distribution patterns for selected species, stock assessments for a small number of species. There have been many efforts to improve the identification of sharks which improves data quality (NPAO).\n\nSpatial:\n\nNetwork of coastal and offshore MPAs – while designed to safeguard a broader set of biodiversity, some of these are located in sites where they can safeguard sharks and important habitat for sharks.\n\n\n\n\nThe Agulhas Bank MPA protects mesophotic kelp forests and gardens of coralline algae on the offshore volcanic pinnacles. The rare speckled guitarfish (Acroteriobatus ocellatus, DD) has been observed in this MPA. (© Georgina Jones)\n\n\nFisheries-wide:\n\nProhibition of nine threatened species in commercial and/or recreational fisheries,\nThe demersal hake trawl fishery has ringfenced its footprint, and no longer trawls outside of these established trawl areas,\nPermit conditions that penalise vessels with high bycatch,\nSize limits in the demersal shark longline fishery,\n\nDaily bag limits in recreational fisheries,\n\nShift from large-mesh gillnets to more selective baited drumlines (i.e. baited hooks suspended from buoys [drums] anchored to the seabed) in lethal shark control programmes and removal of gillnets from most beaches during the winter months to reduce bycatch of predators associated with the sardine run and prevent entanglement of whales,\n\nNevertheless, the persistent high proportion of South Africa’s shark species that are Critically Endangered or Endangered (47 species, 25%) and the declining trend in the RLI for South African sharks indicate that the measures need to be expanded, strengthened, or improved.\nSpatial measures\nSharks need a refuge from fishing pressure. Marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) can play an important role in safeguarding nursery grounds and other essential habitats. Existing MPAs that safeguard important shark habitat include the uThukela Banks, an important nursery areas for several shark species, Protea Banks, which is a known aggregation site for several species, and the Southwest Indian Seamount MPA, which incorporates habitats identified as globally significant for the conservation of shark species in the region2. Such measures are most relevant to resident species, but even highly mobile species often depend on specific sites for one or more key life-cycle processes and may be philopatric.\n\n\n\nThe twinspot skate (Raja ocellifera) is an endemic skate that is Endangered but now receives some protection in the Amathole offshore MPA (© ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink)\n\n\nImportant sites for sharks should be prioritised in any plans to expand and improve management of MPAs, OECMs and other special protection areas, given the high and deteriorating threat status of sharks. Information on important sites for sharks can be gained through the widely respected expert-derived Important Shark and Ray Area (ISRA) process11, Key Biodiversity Areas12 and other approaches (e.g., systematic conservation planning13.\nMuch can also be achieved by expanding the areas within existing MPAs where fisheries that take sharks are restricted or must adopt special measures to prevent capture of threatened sharks13.\nImportant sites that are not protected through MPAs or OECMs can be incorporated into Critical Biodiversity Areas. In addition to MPAs and OECMs, other spatial conservation and management processes, including Environmental Impact Assessments, estuarine management plans, and integrated coastal management plans, need to be directed to consider shark conservation2.\nFisheries management for target species\nAdditional investments are needed to ensure sustainable science-based fisheries management for target species that takes account of the ecosystem effects of shark removals, given the important roles of sharks in coastal and marine ecosystems. This includes specific actions to address excess catch, including a shift from lethal shark control to non-lethal bather protection programmes and increased investment in monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations.\nIn particular, stronger measures are needed to protect the six Critically Endangered and Endangered species that were subject to average annual catches of 11 tonnes or more in the 2013-2023 period (i.e. soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus, CR), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus, EN), dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus, EN), the endemic twineye skate (Raja ocellifera, EN), white skate (Rostroraja alba, EN), common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus, EN))7.\nBycatch\nMost notably, increased investment is urgently needed to reduce the excessive rates of shark bycatch in South Africa’s fisheries and shift towards more selective fishing gears and practices. As noted, approximately two-thirds of the reported shark catch in southern Africa from 2010 to 2012 was bycatch8. Unwanted bycatch harms sharks and fishers who must waste time removing the catch from fishing gear, sometimes at considerable personal risk.\nThis may include expanding the list of prohibited species, strengthening monitoring and enforcement systems, and efforts to reduce high mortality rates for discarded catch (e.g., skills training on how to release hooked sharks to minimise post-release mortality, education and awareness raising aimed improving handling and safe release of sharks caught as unwanted bycatch, especially threatened endemic species, such as the happy Eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsii, EN) and brown shyshark (Haploblepharus fuscus, VU)).\nIllegal fisheries\nInterventions are urgently needed to eradicate illegal gillnetting operations in estuaries and the open sea, recognising that this represents a threat to both legal fisheries and sharks as well as other species taken as bycatch by illegal gillnets7.\nRegional cooperation\nGiven that many of South Africa’s shark species are highly mobile and spend only part of their annual life cycles in South African waters, there is also a need for regional collaboration with other countries (especially neighbouring countries, Mozambique and Namibia) and in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction to reduce threats to South Africa’s sharks beyond our waters. This is especially important for the 47 South African shark species listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered.",

    "text": "Monitoring\nScience-based management to ensure sustainable fisheries for both target and bycatch species within an ecosystem approach to fisheries requires adequate data on the status and trends of relevant fish stocks. In South Africa, fisheries-independent surveys, including demersal trawl surveys and shore angling surveys, provide essential data for status assessments and should be continued or even expanded.\nMore sophisticated fisheries stock assessments designed to optimise harvest levels with respect to various management objectives require reliable time-series of catch and associated effort data. In South Africa, this information is currently only available for 10 species, and stock assessments have only been attempted for 5 species8.\nWhile most of the required catch and effort data are self-reported, self-reporting is not always reliable and datasets can be significantly improved through fisheries observer programmes. It is recommended that the scientific observer programme is re-establshed in the demersal trawl fishery, observer coverage is improved in priority fisheries, and training provided in shark species identification and other relevant skills. Electronic monitoring systems have been tested by various countries and shown to be effective at monitoring catches in some fisheries and could enable expanded coverage at lower cost, but species identification will likely be challenging in the case of sharks. In South Africa, electronic monitoring is being tested in the demersal shark longline fishery, with preliminary results showing promise7. Fisheries observer programmes can also provide a valued source of employment for fisheries-dependent communities.\nMore data is also required to assess the impacts of recreational fisheries, as catches are not currently reported leading to significant gaps in our understanding of fishing pressure.\nMonitoring of species-specific trade statistics would also help to pinpoint and address discrepancies between reported landings and exports, especially for fins destined for Hong Kong markets4, given that most shark products are exported.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nScientific research is essential to improve our understanding of shark biology, ecology, and population status, for assessing the impact of human activities on sharks, and informing management2.\nMuch of the research on South African sharks has focused on the distribution, abundance and movement patterns of large, charismatic, non-harvested species, while fisheries research has focused primarily on the biology and life history of the larger targeted and marketable species or those caught in large numbers in research surveys8.\nIn addition to monitoring of population trends to inform science-based fisheries management, more information is needed on the distribution, habitat, and movement patterns of threatened species, especially identification of sites of particular importance for key life-cycle processes such as mating and feeding aggregations and nursery grounds. This information can then guide spatial management approaches, including identification of sites with critical habitat that are essential for shark conservation and recovery and may require special protection measures.\nAn understanding of key life-history parameters is also needed to identify those less well-studied species that are especially vulnerable to overfishing.\nThe two volumes of Species Profiles of South African Sharks, Rays and Chimaeras9,cliff2025a? provide detailed species-specific comments on current and future importance of research for each species covered.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, a specimen of the Critically Endangered largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis washed up on a beach near East London. The most recent prior record of a sawfish in South Africa was caught in a shark net in 1999.

    "text": "Approach\nSouth African sharks have been assessed through the global IUCN Shark Specialist Group and most of these assessments were adopted for the South African Red List. National assessments were conducted for 33 non-endemic species through a process including two expert workshops and follow-up expert engagements. Species selection was based primarily on the list of shark species included in South Africa’s Second National Plan of Action for sharks (NPOA-Sharks II4) for which the proposed national assessment differed from the current global assessment, followed by consultation with national shark experts.\nTwo data sources are especially important for informing both national and global assessments of sharks occurring in South Africa: demersal trawl surveys along the west and south coasts and shore angling surveys in De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA). These datasets provided the basis for quantitative analysis of population trends. Estimates of population change over three generation lengths were then used to assign species to the most likely IUCN Red List Category. The proposed status was then reviewed by species experts prior to confirmation.\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI)14. The RLI is calculated based on genuine changes in IUCN Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species are becoming more threatened over time.\nThe RLI was calculated for all shark species in South African waters (n = 191), using national status assessments where available and global status assessments otherwise.",

    "text": "Threat status\nSouth Africa has assessed the threat status of 20 248 indigenous plant taxa using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria, which reflect a species’ risk of extinction within the country’s borders. The Red List includes several extinct categories, three threatened categories - Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) - as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD), and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range-restricted endemic species with a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km² that occur in areas with no significant anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are prioritised for national conservation interventions, even if they qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system.\nAmong assessed taxa, 0.2% (36) are extinct or possibly extinct, and 16% (3 195) of the total flora are threatened. The country also has high endemism, with 13 648 taxa (67%) found only in South Africa. The distribution of threatened species is shown in Figure 1, highlighting the concentrations in the Cape Floristic Region, the Succulent Karoo and the eastern escarpment. These are areas where there are both high levels of plant endemism and land use change (habitat loss and degradation).\nGiven the exceptional diversity and high levels of threat, monitoring and reassessing all plant species regularly is not feasible. The Plant Red List team selects certain families or genera to assess each year. To track trends in extinction risk and identify the pressures driving these risks, a representative sample of 900 plant species is used for repeat assessments for each National Biodiversity Assessment. Of the assessed representative plants, 17% taxa are threatened with extinction (Figure 2). This 17% proportion of representatve plant species being threatened likely reflects the actual threat level to plants, as these assessments conducted between 2023 and 2025 include recent threats such as climate change and the impacts of illegal collection for ornamental species, which only became severe in 2019. They also correctly represent intensifying pressures such as habitat loss to mining and the spread of invasive alien plants. Many assessments on the plant Red List pre-date 2018; hence, the 16% portion of the total flora does not accurately reflect the extent to which pressures are increasing extinction risk.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The intervention has slowed and reversed the species’ decline, leading to a genuine improvement in its Red List status. Building on this success, the model is now being expanded to other medicinal plant species, offering a replicable blueprint for balancing cultural practices with biodiversity conservation.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional healers receiving seedlings of the Warburgia salutaris to support conservation and sustainable use of this culturally important medicinal species.

The Red List Index of plants is calculated using the representative sample of 900 taxa.\nThe Red List Index indicates a slow but consistent increase in the risk of extinction of plants. About 5% of sampled taxa became more threatened between 1990 and 2018, with a further 2% increase in threat between 2018 and 2024.\nThe RLI for plant taxa occurring in the Desert and Succulent Karoo biomes decreased most rapidly between 2018 and 2024 (Figure 3) due to increasing pressures from climate change and habitat loss from mining and renewable energy developments. Most of these taxa occur in the Northern Cape. The province has experienced a prolonged drought over the past decade, which has exacerbated the effects of livestock overgrazing, mining, and renewable energy activities.

    "text": "Pressures\nPlants in terrestrial ecosystems face multiple interacting pressures, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive alien species, pollution, unsustainable resource extraction, and climate change. Among these, habitat loss remains the most significant driver of species decline. Habitat loss is primarily caused by the conversion of natural vegetation for croplands, mining, plantations, human settlements, and infrastructure development. Habitat fragmentation further disrupts ecological functioning and reduces population viability, especially in the context of climate change and biological invasions.\nAnalyses of species that have increased their risk of extinction since 2021 reveal a notable shift in the primary drivers of extinction risk for plants. Before 2020, these risks were predominantly associated with competition from invasive species, agricultural expansion, urban development, and overgrazing by livestock2. However, current trends indicate increasing influences from climate change, illegal harvesting, mining, renewable energy projects and habitat degradation in sensitive arid ecosystems in the Northern Cape Province (Figure 4, Table 2). Agriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock farming, continues to affect the largest proportion of plant taxa included in the representative sample (68%), while competition from invasive alien species is also severe (57%). Loss of habitat to residential and commercial developments has slowed since 2010; however, it still impacts 36% of plant taxa due to the ongoing slow loss of habitat. The 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment reported only 9% of plant taxa to be threatened by harvesting; this has increased to 28%, and habitat loss due to mining has increased from 8% in 2018 to 13% in this assessment. The influence of climate change and severe weather events was not reported to be impacting any of the representative sample plants in 2018, but is now pronounced, affecting 11% of taxa (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s plant taxa, based on a representative sample of 900 plant taxa. This bar chart shows the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened and Near Threatened plant species. Pressures are categorised using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and are ranked from most to least frequent number of impacted species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Illegal trade in succulent plants\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s distinctive succulent diversity, notably those endemic to the globally significant Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot, is under increasing pressure from a dramatic surge in illegal harvesting driven by high international demand. Since 2017, 878 mostly localised endemic species have been affected by indiscriminate, unsustainable collection from the wild. Twelve species are now considered functionally extinct due to the majority of individual plants having been harvested from the wild.\nThe succulent illegal harvesting and trade crisis stems from multiple interconnected factors: a notable absence of cultivated material to meet global horticultural demand, limited economic opportunities in remote regions of the Northern Cape that make residents vulnerable to recruitment by criminal syndicates, inadequate in-situ protection measures across vast arid landscapes, and the proliferation of online trade platforms that facilitate operations. These pressures have been exacerbated by climate change impacts (including extended drought conditions since 2016), the COVID-19 pandemic’s socio-economic effects, and overwhelmed conservation authorities struggling with insufficient resources and capacity to manage the growing volume of confiscated plants requiring specialised care.\nRecognising that initial law enforcement responses were unable to manage the full scale of the problem, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, in partnership with the South African National Biodiversity Institute and WWF South Africa, developed the comprehensive National Response Strategy and Action Plan in 2022 to address the illegal trade holistically through collaborative multi-stakeholder action. The strategy encompasses seven interconnected objectives designed to ensure both conservation outcomes and sustainable socio-economic development:\n\nensuring long-term survival of representative wild populations,\nestablishing well-managed ex-situ collections for confiscated specimens,\ncapacitating compliance and enforcement sectors with improved resources and coordination,\nstreamlining regulatory frameworks to support enforcement while enabling sustainable use,\nreducing pressure on wild populations through community engagement and livelihood diversification,\ndeveloping effective communication strategies about the trade’s impacts, and\nexploring options for a formal legal economy that benefits conservation and local development.\n\nEach objective identifies specific actions, lead agencies, supporting partners, priorities, and timelines, with SANBI coordinating overall implementation through dedicated coordination positions established in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trends in the illegal plant trade are constantly changing. Dwarf succulents from the family Aizoaceae originally dominated the trade, while geophytes and Euphorbia have become more popular recently.

Results of the 2024 protection level assessment for (A) a representative sample of 900 plants from the South African flora and (B) a subset of the sample representing endemic taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level measures the contribution of South Africa’s protected area network to meeting plant conservation targets (Figure 6). The plant protection level assessment is applied to the same representative sample from the indigenous flora as used in the Red List Index. Most plants (70%) are Well Protected, however, plants have the second highest proportion of species that are Not Protected (14%), after freshwater fishes (see species protection level under integrated findings). These plant species are found predominantly in the arid central region of South Africa where protected area coverage is sparse (Figure 7). These areas also align with the distribution of Not Protected and Poorly Protected terrestrial ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Relative richness of Not Protected plant taxa across South Africa, based on a representative sample of the indigenous flora.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant protection level has been assessed twice, in 2017 and 2024. Over this time, protection status improved for 7% of taxa but deteriorated for 1% of taxa (Figure 8). Protection status can change through expansion or contraction of the protected area network (as a result of protected area degazettement), or through changes in the effectiveness of protected areas in mitigating pressures on plants.\nImprovements in protection level were the result of both protected area expansion and improvements in protected area effectiveness. The establishment of the Mountain Zebra-Camdeboo Protected Environment in a previously relatively poorly protected part of the Eastern Cape contributed most notably to improving the protection level for multiple plant taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Changes in protection level assessments for the representative sample of 900 plant taxa between 2017 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected area effectiveness can have a significant impact on plant protection level assessments. In 2017, 9% of taxa were downgraded at least one category due to insufficient protected area effectiveness. In 2024, this number improved to 7% of taxa. In the 2024 assessment, 2.5% of taxa were placed in higher protection level categories compared to 2017, solely due to improvements in the effectiveness of the protected areas where they occur. However, the 2024 assessment also highlighted how increasing pressures such as plant poaching, overgrazing, and drought are having significant impacts on protected areas’ capacity to protect plants from extinction. All taxa that were assessed in lower protection level categories in 2024 compared to 2017 were due to deteriorating protected area effectiveness, most notably in the Succulent Karoo region in the Northern Cape and Western Cape. Protected area degazettements, on the other hand, were minor and had no impact on the protection level.\n\n\n\nDaubenya namaquensis, a rare and restricted range species from Namaqualand experienced a genuine improvement in protection level status as a result of the declaration of new protected areas between 2018 and 2025.

    "text": "Species recovery\nSouth Africa, as a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity, is committed to taking urgent action to halt human-induced extinctions, reduce species’ risk of extinction, and improve their conservation status by 2030 (see Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4). Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts to prevent and reverse species declines, recover and conserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity, particularly among threatened species. To contribute to the GBF Target 4 goals, South Africa has initiated a process with each taxonomic group that has comprehensive Red List assessments to identify and prioritise species in urgent need of recovery. Box 4 explains the prioritisation process for plant recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. A prioritisation process for plant recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 3 000 plants threatened with extinction, multiple interventions to address threatened species declines are required, including the expansion of protected areas, the restoration of habitats that are being degraded by invasive species, and the inclusion of threatened plants in biodiversity sector plans. In addition, 293 Critically Endangered and Endangered plants need active recovery projects in order to ensure that they do not go extinct in the next decade.\nBetween 2020 and 2023, the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) led a process to prioritise plants in urgent need of recovery, using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria to select those in most urgent need of recovery. A species recovery working group including conservation agencies and indigenous plant growers has been established, and each stakeholder has been allocated a handful of species on which to implement recovery work. A major upscaling of resources is required, as only 14 of the 293 species identified as needing urgent action have active recovery projects implemented.\nBelow are two examples of Critically Endangered plant species that require urgent recovery interventions to ensure their long-term survival. The flyers outline the key activities needed, including habitat restoration, population reinforcement, and threat mitigation. If you would like to financially support the recovery of Critically Endangered plants from extinction, please use the information on the flyers. Click on the flyer to enlarge",

    "text": "Approach\n\nThreat status assessment\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria are used to assess the threat status of plant taxa in South Africa. The 2025 South African National Plant Checklist records 23 514 taxa and 21 539 species, of which 20 204 are indigenous. Remarkably, 60.5% of these indigenous species are endemic to the country. This enormous number of plant taxa, and the very limited number of plant Red List specialists in the country, makes it challenging to assess all plant taxa regularly –so SANBI coordinates and undertakes the assessments of certain families or genera each year. The Red List of South African Plants website hosts all national assessments conducted for plants. To track trends in extinction risk and identify the pressures driving these risks, a representative sample of 900 plant species is used for repeat assessments for each National Biodiversity Assessment.\nClick here to read more about the Red List of species\n\n\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a persistence target for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends on the area protected and on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas – quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target is within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness – adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines (such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes, etc.) are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major pressures;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major pressures on species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major pressures on the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.\nClick here to read more about the Species Protection Level.",

While there are many more roan in South Africa, our assessments only include animals that meet the wildness framework criteria (Child et. al. 2019) since intensively managed animals would not survive without continuous human intervention and hence cannot be considered part of South Africa’s wild population. Roan antelope experienced a 90% decline in the Kruger National Park between 1986 and 1993, however numbers have since stabilised. One of the primary causes of decline was the addition of artificial waterholes within the range of roan in Kruger National Park, which attracted other large grazers such as zebra and wildebeest and subsequent increases in predator numbers in the north of the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Charles Hall\n\n\n\n\nSable antelope (Hippotragus niger)\n\n\n\nSable antelope populations show similar patterns, with about 1 107 wild individuals nationally and declines in most state-owned reserves, except in Kruger National Park and Loskop Dam Nature Reserve, where populations have increased by 441% over three generations.\nBoth species are vulnerable to habitat degradation, competition with other herbivores, predation pressure, and ecological management challenges, including artificial water provisioning and overstocking.\nApproximately 77% of South Africa’s roan antelope and substantial numbers of sable antelope occur on private land. Recent assessments using the wildness framework (Child et al., 2019) indicate that about half of private roan and 40% of private sable populations retain wild characteristics, contributing meaningfully to national conservation outcomes.",

    "section": "The contribution of the wildlife economy to biodiversity conservation",
    "text": "The contribution of the wildlife economy to biodiversity conservation\nAgainst this backdrop, the wildlife sector has emerged as a cornerstone of conservation success in South Africa, contributing significantly to both species recovery and habitat restoration. Through the expansion of reserves, conservancies, and wildlife ranches, large tracts of former agricultural land have been restored to functional ecosystems, supporting viable populations of charismatic and threatened species such as roan and sable antelope, rhinoceroses, and elephants. For several of these species, private landholders now manage the majority of national populations.\nThe expansion of privately and communally managed conservation areas has also been instrumental in securing and reconnecting habitat for many of the country’s wildlife species. Over half (53.2%) of South Africa’s white rhinoceroses are now held in private ownership, illustrating the important contribution of private custodians to the species’ recovery and persistence (’t Sas Rolfes et al. 2022). Many of these reserves depend on hunting, and the hunting industry has therefore provided an incentive for recovery of rhinos. Poaching of rhinos for their horn threatens to undermine this species’ recovery since many landowners cannot afford the security costs and are starting to disinvest in rhinos (Clements et al., 2023).\nAdditional challenges remain in the management of wildlife populations, particularly where intensive management and selective breeding practices are employed. Such approaches may reduce genetic diversity, alter natural evolutionary trajectories, or shift management priorities from conservation outcomes toward commercial production. The selective breeding of ungulates for specific morphological traits, such as exaggerated horn structures or colour variants (Selier et al., 2018), and the captive breeding of lions have been widely debated for their conservation relevance and animal welfare implications.\nWhile some authors contend that captive-bred lions can serve as a buffer to pressures on wild lion populations by supplying the demand for trophy hunting and derived products (Lindsey et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2015; Williams & ’t Sas Rolfes, 2019), others argue that the conservation contribution of captive lions is minimal or negligible (Coals et al., 2019; Coals et al., 2020; Elwin et al., 2024). Concerns regarding welfare, ecological integrity, and reputational risks have contributed to a shift in policy direction. In 2024, the South African government adopted a policy position to phase out the captive keeping and breeding of lions, as outlined in the Policy Position for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Elephant, Lion, Leopard and Rhinoceros (DFFE, 2024).\nLooking forward, certification schemes and incentive-based mechanisms could strengthen the positive impact of the wildlife sector by rewarding best practices, promoting transparency, and encouraging management that aligns with national biodiversity goals. By fostering stewardship and accountability, these approaches can ensure that managed populations remain genetically robust, ecologically functional, and as wild as possible.\nOverall, the wildlife sector stands as one of South Africa’s great conservation success stories demonstrating that when biodiversity and livelihoods are effectively linked, conservation and economic sustainability can go hand in hand.\n\nRecommended citation\nRaimondo, D.C., Selier, J., Pfab, M., Van Der Colff, D., Monyeki, M.S., & Hendricks, S.E. 2025.

Birds are in general becoming increasingly threatened with extinction, with 39 species uplisted to higher threat categories.\nThe main pressures driving change in threat status have remained similar to those driving change in the previous assessments. However, in this assessment, the plight of waterbirds has been highlighted, with many waterbirds being uplisted to a higher category of threat.\nFreshwater condition needs improvement to protect these species; however, it will require strong political commitment and resources. Many freshwater species are congregatory and thus vulnerable to disease outbreaks, making protection of key sites and improvement in water quality in these systems essential to slow declines. Urban freshwater systems offer valuable opportunities for citizen-led restoration and monitoring.\nUsing a subpopulation method based on proximal protected areas, a large proportion of bird species are Well Protected within the South African protected area network (86%, 561 species); with only 7% Poorly Protected and in need of intervention to increase their protection level.\nWhen protection level is assessed using a Minimum Conservation Population (MCP) approach that incorporates species-specific abundance thresholds, protection levels are far lower: only 10% of assessed species are Well Protected, while the vast majority (90%) remain inadequately protected despite occurring within the protected area network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

The region has a long history of publishing lists of threatened bird species, with Red Data Books published in 1976, 1984, 2000 and most recently in 2025, when 132 species were listed with an IUCN threat category greater than Least Concern. Given growing evidence of shifting population trends and continued anthropogenic pressures reshaping habitats, an updated Regional Red List assessment was conducted by BirdLife South Africa from late 2021 to early 2025, with contributions from 138 species experts (see approach section below for further details on how the assessment was conducted).\nNearly 13% (93) of assessed bird species are threatened with extinction, with another 7% (54) assessed as Near Threatened. Of South Africa’s endemic bird species, 34% (9 out of 26) are threatened with extinction (Figure 2).\nA total of 25 species were uplisted from LC or Not Evaluated to higher threat categories due to deterioration in status. Most of these (n = 16) were waterbirds, followed by terrestrial (n = 6), seabirds (n = 2) and a raptor species (n = 1).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Conservation success story: the white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white-winged flufftail (Sarotheura ayresi) is one of Africa’s rarest and most threatened waterbirds, with breeding confirmed only in South Africa and Ethiopia. Previously listed as Critically Endangered (CR), the species was downlisted to Endangered (EN) in South Africa in 2025. This change does not reflect a reduction in pressures, rather a better scientific understanding of its distribution and population size, accompanied by significant conservation success in safeguarding its specialised wetland habitat.\nSince 2020, BirdLife South Africa’s Wetland and White-winged Flufftail Conservation Project has spearheaded efforts to conserve high-elevation wetlands, the species’ breeding habitat during the wet season. The project vision is to maintain and improve the quality and quantity of these wetlands to support threatened species and secure ecosystem services for local communities. The approach integrates management, restoration, protection, stewardship, advocacy, awareness, and research using the white-winged flufftail as a flagship species for wetland conservation.\nKey achievements include:\n\nManagement & restoration: publication of Best Practice Guidelines for High-Elevation Wetland and Peatland Management in Southern Africa in multiple local languages, bridging the gap between scientific research and land users responsible for stewarding wetlands.\nProtection & stewardship: declaration of Middelpunt Nature Reserve (527 ha) and designation as a Ramsar Site, expansion of the Greater Lakenvlei Protected Environment (21 400 ha), and new stewardship agreements in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal to conserve biodiversity alongside daily land-use activities.\nCommunity engagement: establishment of the Steenkampsberg Birding Routes and employment of a community bird guide at Ntsikeni Nature Reserve to promote eco-tourism and local custodianship through financial incentives.\nPolicy & advocacy: publication of surveying and mitigation guidelines for environmental impact assessments of developments within the species’ distributional range, endorsed by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment.\nAwareness: publication of two children’s books (and audiobooks) for different age groups and raising awareness among children and adults during the annual Flufftail Festival hosted on World Wetlands Day.\nResearch: dedicated surveys using passive monitoring equipment provided the first empirical population estimate of ~900 breeding pairs (1 800 mature individuals) across just 20 km² of suitable habitat in South Africa.\n\nThese collective efforts, underpinned by partnerships with government, landowners, NGOs, universities, and international agreements (e.g., AEWA and CMS), directly informed the 2025 IUCN Regional Red List assessment for the white winged flufftail. The protection level for the species has changed from “Not Protected” to “Poorly Protected” thanks to the declaration of key protected areas. The white-winged flufftail now qualifies as Endangered under criterion B2ab(iii), highlighting both its precarious status and the tangible conservation gains achieved through science-based collaborative action.\nBy using the white-winged flufftail as a flagship species for wetland conservation, conservationists have not only improved prospects for one of Africa’s most elusive birds, but also safeguarded critical wetlands that sustain biodiversity and provide water resources for many downstream communities.\n\n \n\n\nWhite-winged flufftail, landing (left), while monitoring is taking place in its habitat (right).

    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI)2. The RLI is calculated based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species are becoming more threatened over time. The Red List Index of birds was calculated for all taxa that have been reassessed (n = 729).\nThrough calculating the RLI, it was found that many species have shifted in their threat levels over the last decade. Results indicate that the average RLI score across 729 species decreased between 2015 and 2025, evidence that the overall extinction risk has worsened. A total of 147 species had a threat status higher than Least Concern for 2025. Although 131 species showed no change in status, 39 deteriorated (moving into higher risk categories) and 8 improved. The analysis highlights that habitat degradation, invasive species, powerline collisions, climate change, and fisheries impacts remain pressing conservation issues. These pressures are not concentrated in only certain parts of South Africa, they are spread quite widely across the country (Figure 4). Targeting these pressures is essential, especially for species newly classified as Vulnerable or Endangered.\n\nFigureTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Pressures\nThis assessment identifies agriculture as the dominant pressure on South African birds, representing 63% of cumulative pressure – nearly double the impact of natural system modifications at 43%. The agriculture category encompasses three critical sub-pressures: wood and pulp plantations contributing 24%, annual and perennial non-timber crops at 23%, and livestock farming at 16%. These findings reflect South Africa’s agricultural transformation, particularly in grassland and fynbos biomes. Grassland species such as Botha’s (Spizocorys fringillaris) and Rudd’s larks (Heteromirafra ruddi), blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea), African grass owl (Tyto capensis) and Denham’s bustard (Neotis denhami) are under extreme pressure with declining populations, while plantations similarly affect forest species such as Cape parrot (Poicephalus robustus) (Figure 5).\nBotha’s lark (Spizocorys fringillaris) and lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos) were uplisted to Critically Endangered (CR). Their primary pressures, habitat loss and poisoning respectively, are well understood, and urgent conservation action is essential to prevent their extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Habitat loss in the grasslands: Botha’s lark (Spizocorys fringillaris)\n\n\n\n\n\nBotha’s lark is one of South Africa’s most threatened birds, now assessed as Critically Endangered, with only 340 individuals estimated to be remaining3. Endemic to the high-altitude grasslands of Mpumalanga and the Free State, its tiny global population has declined by more than 80% over the past decade. The primary driver of this decline is habitat loss and degradation, with over 90% of its preferred short-grassland habitat converted to croplands (maize and soya), or altered by inappropriate grazing practices.\nRecent field surveys, modelling of preferred habitat extent, and SABAP2 data trends confirm alarming range contractions, including the near disappearance of the species from its former northern and southern distribution limits. The few remaining strongholds, such as the Wakkerstroom–Daggakraal region, are under increasing pressure from maize farming, pasture improvement, and invasive alien plants. Habitat fragmentation further isolates subpopulations, limiting dispersal and increasing extinction risk.\nBotha’s lark exemplifies the broader crisis facing South Africa’s sourveld and highland grasslands, ecosystems that provide essential ecosystem services such as water regulation and carbon storage but remain among the most poorly protected ecosystem types. A range of other threatened species call these areas home, including Rudd’s lark (Heteromirafra ruddi) and yellow-breasted pipit (Anthus chloris).\n\nBotha’s lark (Spizocorys fringillaris) on its breeding grounds in the high altitude grasslands of Wakkerstroom, Mpumalanga. (© David Ehlers Smith)\n\nUnfortunately, most of the Botha’s Lark habitat falls outside of formally protected areas. Conservation responses have included stewardship agreements with private landowners, community outreach, and exploration of targeted habitat restoration. However, without urgent expansion of formal protection and sustainable landuse practices, this iconic species faces imminent extinction.\nSee full assessment details here - https://www.birdlife.org.za/red-list/bothas-lark/\n\n\n\nNatural system modifications, the second-largest pressure, primarily involves ecosystem alterations and fire suppression regimes that disrupt natural habitat dynamics. Waterbirds are particularly vulnerable to natural system modification (Figure 5), in addition to pollution of wetlands and waterways, with mangrove kingfisher (Halcyon senegaloides) being a notable example of a species undergoing declines. The decline of waterbirds not previously considered threatened is particularly concerning, though unsurprising given the poor state of freshwater habitats. These habitats are highly vulnerable to pollution, invasive species, siltation, and extreme weather. Improving freshwater health will require significant political will and resources. Freshwater species also face added risks because many are congregatory, making them prone to disease outbreaks. Better management of key sites is needed to prevent accelerated declines, while urban freshwater systems present opportunities for citizen-led restoration and monitoring.\nClimate change emerges as the third major pressure at 30%, driven predominantly by habitat shifting and alteration as species distributions respond to changing climatic conditions.\nNotably, biological resource use – primarily hunting and collecting terrestrial animals – accounts for 24% of pressures, while human development pressures including residential and transportation infrastructure collectively represent 28%. The data aggregation reveals that while individual sub-pressures may appear manageable, their cumulative impact within broader pressure categories creates substantial conservation challenges requiring integrated landscape-scale management approaches. Scavenging birds such as vultures and tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) are experiencing rapid declines due to poisoning and persecution (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s birds, based on the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Poisoning crisis: Africa’s vultures on the brink\n\n\n\n\n\nMass poisoning event of African white backed vulture (Gyps africanus) in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal. (© Chris Kelly)\nPoisoning is the single greatest driver of vulture declines across Africa. In southern Africa and beyond, almost all scavenging vulture species are now listed as Critically Endangered: white-headed (Trigonoceps occipitalis), hooded (Necrosyrtes monachus), white-backed (Gyps africanus), bearded (Gypaetus barbatus), and lappet-faced (Torgos tracheliotos) vultures. Only the Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres), which breeds in colonies and has benefited from decades of conservation action, and the palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), with its specialised diet of raffia palm fruit and aquatic prey, are not considered Critically Endangered.\nAmong the most devastating practices is sentinel poisoning, where poachers deliberately lace carcasses with toxic substances to eliminate vultures that might otherwise reveal illegal activities by circling above a kill. These events can wipe out hundreds of individuals in a single incident, impacting decades of conservation efforts.\nVultures are also highly vulnerable to secondary poisoning. In many rural areas, carcasses are baited with pesticides or poisons to target carnivores such as jackals, caracals, and lions. When vultures descend to feed, they are killed unintentionally in large numbers. Because these birds forage communally, even one poisoned carcass can have catastrophic consequences.\nOther sources of poisoning continue to exacerbate the crisis. Veterinary drugs (e.g., Diclofenac) used to treat livestock can remain in carcasses and are toxic to scavengers. Lead poisoning from ammunition fragments in carcasses has been detected in several vulture populations. Even contaminated water sources pose risks in areas where agricultural chemicals are poorly regulated. Collectively, these threats undermine not only vulture populations but also the ecological role they fulfil.\nThe decline of vultures has far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and people. As nature’s clean-up crew, vultures rapidly dispose of carcasses, helping to prevent the spread of diseases such as anthrax and rabies. Their disappearance risks creating a dangerous vacuum in which carcasses linger, promoting outbreaks that threaten wildlife, livestock, and human health alike.\nRecognising the urgency of this crisis, governments and conservation organisations have developed targeted responses. The International Vulture Multi-species Action Plan5 and the South African Multi-species Biodiversity Management Plan for Vultures6 both identify poisoning as the top conservation priority. Actions include phasing out the most dangerous agrochemicals, raising awareness among farming and hunting communities, tracking individual vultures, and deploying rapid-response poison intervention units. One striking example of the latter occurred in May 2025 in Kruger National Park, when the Endangered Wildlife Trust and SANParks mounted a large-scale rescue after an elephant carcass was poisoned, managing to save more than 80 vultures through rapid detection, treatment and rehabilitation. Such coordinated responses are vital, yet prevention remains the ultimate goal.\nDespite these efforts, numbers of lappet-faced and other vultures continue to decline. They are wide-ranging and require engagement and action across many countries. If poisoning is not urgently and decisively addressed, southern Africa risks losing much of its vulture guild within a single human generation, with profound ecological and social consequences.",

    "text": "Protection level\nTo measure protection status, BirdLife South Africa applied two complementary approaches: a subpopulation-based method covering 667 terrestrial bird species, and a population-based method applied to 130 Red List species with available abundance estimates (see approach below). The subpopulation approach confirms that most birds are spatially well represented within the protected area network, with over 84% classified as Well Protected in both 2017 (84.1%) and 2025 (84.9%), in broad agreement with the study on measuring protection effectiveness for terrestrial bird species in protected areas and OECMs in South Africa7. Between 2017 and 2025, mean Protection Level scores increased from 7.50 (±0.32 SE) to 8.53 (±0.35 SE), representing a 13.7% increase, although only nine species (1.3%) showed improved protection categories between assessment periods – most gains were for species of low conservation concern.\nThe population-based analysis paints a more sobering picture, revealing that only 10% of threatened species meet minimum viable population thresholds inside protected areas. However, there was a positive movement to improved category status from 2017 to 2025: 123 of the 130 Red List species did not reach the Well Protected category in 2017, compared to 117 for 2025, representing an improvement of 4.6%. Together, these results highlight both the conservation value of South Africa’s protected areas and the gaps that remain, particularly for threatened, range-restricted and habitat-dependent species that require targeted expansion and improved management of the network8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Protection level for birds was assessed for 667 taxa. Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa); (A) shows the protection level for all taxa; (B) shows the protection level for South African endemics using the spatial protection method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. The overall protection level of bird species varies dramatically depending on the assessment method used as well as sets of species used. The analysis shown here is based on a subset of only 130 species that have detailed population data available assessed during the 2025 red listing process, it shows the difference between using a population-based target (number of mature individuals) versus a subpopulation based target. ‘Subpopulations’ represents populations in connected protected area clusters, see the study on measuring protection effectiveness for terrestrial bird species in protected areas in South Africa8 for details on the two methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe endemic, range-restricted and Vulnerable red lark (Calendulauda burra) is an example of a species receiving marginal benefit from the Protected Area Network in 2017. However, with the advent of the declaration of Meerkat National Park, the number of pentads under the Protected Area Network rose from five to 28. (© David Ehlers Smith)",

    "section": "Species recovery",
    "text": "Species recovery\nDespite South Africa’s extensive protected area network, many bird species remain at high risk of extinction because they face pressures that persist even when habitat is nominally safeguarded. Large birds, including vultures and storks, are prime examples. Recovery interventions are therefore essential to prevent imminent extinctions and to reverse long-term declines. Birds requiring recovery action tend to fall into three groups: (1) highly range-restricted endemics whose tiny populations are declining faster than habitat loss alone can explain; (2) species exposed to direct anthropogenic pressures such as poisoning, fisheries interactions, or collisions with energy infrastructure; and (3) island or seabird populations threatened by invasive predators at breeding sites.\nPriority areas for bird recovery are guided by the 2025 Red List assessments and subsequent expert consultations. These processes identified species whose continued declines are unlikely to be halted by protected area coverage alone, and which therefore require targeted interventions. While the expansion of protected and conserved areas under Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 3 is essential, recovery planning shows that protection alone is insufficient unless paired with targeted species-focused measures. Where published prioritisation exists, such as the Biodiversity Management Plan for Vultures6 or the Mouse-Free Marion Project plans, these form the basis for coordinated action. In other cases, BirdLife South Africa and partners use a combination of Red List urgency, ecological feasibility, and opportunity for partnerships with landowners or government to determine priorities.\nSelected active recovery projects are highlighted below (Table 3). This showcases both the diversity of interventions needed and the scale of resources required. Some species, such as Botha’s lark, require stewardship agreements and changes in land-use practices to secure remnant grassland habitat. Others, such as the blue swallow, demand artificial nest-site provisioning and alien clearing in addition to site protection. For marine birds such as the African penguin, population recovery hinges on fisheries reform, fishery closures around key colonies, and advocacy on threats such as ship-to-ship bunkering.\nSeveral threatened vultures (white-backed, lappet-faced, hooded and white-headed vultures) require landscape-scale pressure reduction, including poison-response networks, regulation of traditional medicine markets, a change in the hunting culture preference for lead-based ammunition, and mitigation of electrocution and collision risks. In contrast, the bearded vulture recovery strategy combines in situ action with a long-term ex situ programme Bearded Vulture Captive Breeding Project, where harvested eggs are raised in captivity and juveniles reintroduced.\nSpecies like the black harrier highlight the urgent need for collision mitigation at wind energy facilities, given population viability models showing extreme sensitivity to adult mortality.\nOn Marion Island, a suite of seabird species (including albatrosses, petrels, and prions) are threatened by the invasive house mouse (Mus musculus), which predate on chicks and even adults. Without eradication, local extinctions are predicted within a century. The Mouse-Free Marion Project budgeted at over R560 million, represents the largest single bird recovery initiative underway in southern Africa. See marine bird page for further details.\nCollectively, these examples illustrate that recovery work is expensive and long-term, with estimated costs for the next five years exceeding R695 million and current funding falling short by hundreds of millions. While interventions are in place for many species, most require upscaling if they are to prevent extinctions. Success will depend on strong partnerships among government, NGOs, researchers, landowners, and local communities, and on mobilising significant new resources to match the scale of the challenge, in alignment with global commitments such as GBF Target 3 (expansion and effective management of protected areas) and GBF Target 4 (halting species extinctions and promoting recovery).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Recovery efforts for Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) has suffered severe historical declines due to multiple threats, including poisoning (both intentional and accidental), collisions and electrocutions on powerlines, food shortages, disturbance at colonies, and illegal harvesting for the traditional medicine trade. Once widespread across southern Africa, the species has disappeared from large parts of its former range, and today is largely confined to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and parts of Mozambique.\nIn response, the species has become the focus of intensive conservation action. South African based NGO VulPro, established in 2007, has played a central role in rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured birds, returning over 600 vultures to the wild and pioneering dedicated captive-breeding programmes for African vultures (including through working with various partners such as a National Zoological Garden). Their facilities in Hartbeespoort and the Eastern Cape also provide a base for research on movement ecology, toxicology, and disease, alongside extensive education and community outreach.\nComplementary initiatives by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) address systemic threats at both national and continental scales. Through its Vultures for Africa Programme, the EWT has trained more than 6 500 people in 17 African countries to respond to and manage poisoning incidents, produced a multilingual Wildlife Poisoning Response Protocol, and supported the adoption of at least nine national response plans in poisoning hotspots. The organisation also spearheaded International Vulture Awareness Day, now celebrated annually in over 40 countries, as well as long-term tracking and monitoring programmes that have established tagged populations in Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana and Uganda. At home, EWT leads South Africa’s Wildlife and Energy Programme, marking thousands of kilometres of powerlines in partnership with Eskom, and sits on the National Vulture Task Force and the Lead Task Team addressing poisoning and lead exposure.\nAt the international level, multiple conservation organisations have played a pivotal role in developing and reviewing the Multi-species Action Plan for African–Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP) under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). Its 2023–24 mid-term review highlighted the escalating risks of belief-based use, bushmeat-related poisoning, and the collision threats posed by expanding renewable energy infrastructure. These findings underline the urgency of both national and transboundary collaboration to secure vulture populations.\nAs a result of all the interventions described here, the Cape vulture was downlisted from Endangered (2015) to Vulnerable (2025). Despite these successes, ongoing recovery remains essential. Cape vultures face intensifying threats, particularly from collisions with rapidly expanding wind energy facilities where mitigation measures are not applied, and from increasing demand in the traditional medicine market. Sustained investment in rescue, rehabilitation, population supplementation, and systemic threat reduction, alongside continued political commitment, regional cooperation, and community involvement, will be vital to secure the long-term survival of this species.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nWhile many longstanding pressures on South Africa’s birds are well recognised, a number of emerging threats and uncertainties require urgent research attention. Addressing these gaps will require both targeted research and systematic integration of new pressures into future Red List and protection level assessments. Improved data on novel threats, particularly energy infrastructure, agrochemical exposure, and marine resource exploitation, will strengthen conservation planning and ensure that the National Biodiversity Assessment reflects the full scope of pressures shaping South Africa’s birdlife.\nAgriculture and expansion of croplands continues to be linked to biodiversity loss, however the dynamics of this have been poorly quantified. For example, the rapid expansion of shaded agriculture, where fruit orchards are increasingly sealed under giant greenhouse structures will likely have negative impacts on avian biodiversity. These prevent access to flowering trees by natural pollinators and may have cascading impacts on terrestrial biodiversity. Parallel to this, agrochemical use has grown substantially, yet its full impact on South African birds and other wildlife is poorly understood. In addition, the spread of novel crops, including genetically modified organisms introduced into new habitats, raises questions about long-term ecosystem impacts.\nClimate change represents a cross-cutting pressure where biodiversity impacts remain poorly quantified at the species level. Although broad projections suggest range contractions and distribution shifts for many taxa, very few South African birds have been assessed using bespoke best-practice models that integrate climatic, habitat and demographic data. This leaves uncertainty about which species are most vulnerable, the likely magnitude of impacts, and where conservation interventions should be prioritised. Incorporating climate velocity, dispersal capacity, and habitat quality into future assessments will be essential to identify both high-risk species and potential refugia.\nEnergy demand is another fast-moving frontier. The growth of cryptocurrency mining and AI technologies is driving global electricity consumption, yet the scale and consequences for South Africa remain largely unquantified. At the same time, renewable energy developments, particularly the rapid rollout of wind energy projects in Mpumalanga and along the coast, pose escalating risks for birds and bats. Offshore wind energy generation is also emerging as a potential future pressure on marine biodiversity.\nNew biological challenges are also evident. The proliferation of novel diseases, often exacerbated by climate change and land-use shifts, poses unknown risks to terrestrial bird populations. Bush encroachment in the karoo, grasslands and savannas, inappropriate fire regimes, and habitat fragmentation continue to alter habitat quality for specialist species. Illegal ploughing and clearing of natural habitats remain a widespread challenge, often circumventing environmental impact assessments.\nMarine and coastal systems face their own suite of emerging pressures. Sardine stocks remain depleted, yet sardines are a keystone prey resource for seabirds and other predators; current operational management procedures inadequately account for ecosystem needs. Coastal aquaculture, including reliance on fishmeal and bonemeal inputs, has ecological knock-on effects that are poorly quantified. Sand mining is expanding along the coast, threatening coastal biodiversity. Meanwhile, ship-to-ship bunkering operations, paused off Algoa Bay but likely to increase elsewhere, introduce additional risks of oil spills, noise pollution, and chronic disturbance in sensitive seabird areas.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\n\nThreat status assessment\nThe Regional Conservation Assessment for the birds of South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini was conducted by BirdLife South Africa with contributions from 138 species experts. It was initiated in late 2021, and assessments concluded at the start of 2025. This assessment builds upon the 2015 Eskom Red Data Book findings. All of Southern Africa’s non-vagrant species were assessed for signs of decline using citizen science datasets such as SABAP2, CWAC and CAR9. Taxon experts conducted assessments, updating assessments conducted in 2015 and conducting new ones for newly identified species (see Regional Red List of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini here).\nSpecies deemed vagrants or introduced to the assessment region were excluded. At least 5% of a species’ global population or distribution needed to fall within the region to qualify for an assessment. We used BirdLife South Africa’s Checklist of South Africa’s birds for 2023 as a starting point. This lists 876 species, but 123 were vagrant and 10 introduced. Introduced and vagrant species are not assessed during the Red Listing process, leaving 753 species. The taxonomy followed is that of the IOC World Bird List10. During 2023, a focus was on assessing Seabird species, for which there are few public datasets available, and where assessments rely heavily on expert knowledge. In 2023, a comprehensive synthesis of citizen science datasets for terrestrial (including freshwater) bird species was undertaken and these datasets fed the 2024 assessments of terrestrial and freshwater birds9 8. The thresholds and methods follow IUCN Global and Regional Red List guidelines and take into account new data on distribution, population trends, and known threats (IUCN Red Listing process summary here).\n\n\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a persistence target for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends on the area protected and on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas – quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target is within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness – adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines (such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes, etc.) are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major pressures;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major pressures on species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major pressures on the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.\nProtected areas are the backbone of biodiversity conservation in South Africa. To measure protection status, BirdLife South Africa first piloted a species-level Protection Level (PL) metric in 2017, measuring the number of viable bird subpopulations occurring in well-managed protected areas7. Species occurring in &gt;20 protected areas were deemed to be well protected. The method was refined for the current National Biodiversity Assessment using improved spatial data, updated land-cover information, and a cluster-based definition of subpopulations, with &gt;10 subpopulations required in protected area clusters. This framework allows a systematic comparison between 2017 and 2025, providing an evidence-based measure of how effectively the protected area network supports the long-term persistence of South Africa’s avifauna8.\n\nData source\nBarnes, K.

Although only three species have experienced a genuine increase in threat status; many species are still experiencing ongoing pressures.\nThe main pressures causing population declines are invasive and other problematic species, impacting 83% of threatened species. Impacts range from infectious diseases to drying out and replacement of habitat by invasive alien plants. This is followed by habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural activities (72%) and natural system modification (69%) related to, for example, wetland drainage, overgrazing, and inappropriate fire cycles. Recognised as the most important emerging threat globally, climate change impacts are also becoming an important driver of amphibian declines in South Africa affecting nearly half of threatened species, although the impacts of this threat are challenging to quantify.\nA large proportion of amphibians are assessed as Well Protected (73%) within the South African Protected Area Network; however, 11% (15) of amphibian species are Not Protected. Of the 29 threatened species, 79% are considered under-protected (Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected or Not Protected). Meaning that our most threatened species require improved protection, and most protected areas do not consider amphibians in their management activities.\nAlmost 50% (17) of South Africa’s threatened species occur in the Western Cape province. Given the high endemicity within this province, and the disproportional number of endemic species that are threatened, this spatial pattern is not surprising. The Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces support four and six threatened species, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Most threatened species occur in, and are endemic to, the Western Cape (17 species), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (6 species) and then the Eastern Cape (4 species).\nTwenty-two percent (30 species) of amphibians were assessed as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable), and a further 10% (13 species) were assessed as Near Threatened. There have been significant shifts in the number of species per category since the 2016 assessments, with 23% of species experiencing a category change, although most of these have been non-genuine either because of improved application of the Red List criteria or because of extensive survey efforts resulting in better knowledge of the status of populations. These changes include a decrease from 6 to 4 Critically Endangered species; an increase from 9 to 18 Endangered species; an increase from 1 to 8 Vulnerable; and a reduction of 4 to 2 Data Deficient.

    "text": "Trends - the Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI)2. The RLI are calculated based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, and if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern, and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The slope of the line show the rate at which the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction. The Red List Index of amphibians was calculated for all amphibian taxa that have been reassessed (n = 135).\nThirty species have had a change in status since the latest assessment (2016 to 2025). However, only two of these are genuine changes: Breviceps macrops – desert rain frog (NT to VU) and Amietia hymenopus - Phofung river frog (NT to VU). These species are spatially isolated; however, they share some pressures, as both Breviceps macrops and Amietia hymenopus are likely to be impacted by climate change. The former is restricted to the dry West Coast of South Africa and relies on limited precipitation in the form of fog; and the latter occurs in streams along the Drakensberg Escarpment and Lesotho, which may face increased drying and extreme weather events. Both species are also impacted by the expansion of mining activities, B. macros specifically on the West Coast, due to the future planned development of Green Hydrogen and A. hymenopus in the highlands of Lesotho into South Africa (Table 2).\nThe remaining species that have had a change in their status were considered to be non-genuine changes due to new information, taxonomic changes, application of criteria, etc. There has been no improvement in the status of amphibians during the assessment period. Important to note is that amphibians remain threatened by pressures that have not ceased and are increasing in most instances. Of particular concern are the impacts of invasive alien species, which affect 83% of threatened species, particularly in cases where the spread of invasive species is continuing or increasing. Impacts of this threat include drying out and replacement of habitat by alien invasive plants, diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and competition with problematic native species (Box 2).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

For South Africa’s frogs, the main pressures driving declines are impacts from invasive species, affecting 76% of threatened and Near Threatened species. These impacts include replacement of natural habitat due to expansion of woody invasive plants, drying out of wetlands and streams, changes to stream dynamics, including sedimentation, and alteration of natural fire regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2: Invasive species impacts on range-restricted amphibians\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critically Endangered rough moss frog, (Arthroleptella rugosa) is restricted to the Klein Swartberg Mountain in the Western Cape. Within less than a decade, large portions of its seepage habitat in the fynbos have been invaded by cluster pines (Pinus pinaster). A study using bioacoustics to estimate frog densities found that numbers at invaded sites were directly affected by P. pinaster infestations5. At invaded sites, call densities (and hence population numbers) were reduced, while at uninvaded sites call densities were notably higher. These results confirm previous\n\n\n\n\n© Alouis and Keir Lynch Bionerds\n\n\nsuggestions that invasive pine trees cause population declines in A. rugosa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese findings were used as motivation for conservation action and a joint initiative through CapeNature, the Endangered Wildlife Trust, Fynbos Trust, 18 landowners and the Klein Swartberg Conservancy, resulted in adaptive fire management to control pine invasion across the species range. An ecological burn was carried out, which covered approximately 4 000 hectares, and eradicated pines from areas where A. rugosa occurs. Post-fire monitoring has confirmed increasing numbers of frogs, and a 10-year management plan has been developed with the Conservancy, including ongoing alien plant management. This is a great example of conservation needs being guided by expert knowledge and Red List assessment information, which have also resulted in the designation of this species entire range as an Alliance for Zero Extinction site, thus gaining international\n\n\n\n\nPine infestation of fynbos habitat on Klein Swartberg where the Critically Endangered rough moss frog, Arthroleptella rugosa, occurs.

Modifications can exacerbate inappropriate fire cycles. Globally, climate change is now recognised as the most serious emerging challenge facing amphibians, with 29% of threatened species worldwide impacted. This threat is expected to affect more species in the future with projected increases in temperature and changes in precipitation. In South Africa, 38% of our threatened and Near threatened species are impacted, or projected to be impacted by climate change and extreme weather, through shifts in habitat, droughts and flooding. These impacts require data to improve predictive models of amphibian habitats; for example, species monitoring and climate data. Fourteen threatened species (33%) are affected by pollution, particularly from agricultural effluents and domestic and urban waste water. A good example is the subpopulations of the Kloof frog, (Natalobatrachus bonebergi), in Durban that are impacted by sewage overflows into streams and increased sedimentation from urban construction, where it has a severe impact on stream health and breeding sites. Even while this species has been downlisted from EN to NT due to overall EOO and the correct application of the criteria, the KwaZulu-Natal subpopulations face increasing levels of threat. These impacts reflect the state of South Africa’s freshwater ecosystems, with many systems currently assessed as modified (see Freshwater ecosystem pressures).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.

Two peripheral taxa with less than 5% of their distribution in South Africa were excluded from the analysis. Protection level categories include ‘Poorly Protected’, ‘Moderately Protected’, ‘Not Protected’ and ‘Well Protected’. Protection levels were calculated for amphibians by intersecting amphibian occurrence records with the protected area spatial layer, and calculating the area required to protect a target population of 10 000 individuals. Protection levels were also adjusted based on the management effectiveness of protected areas. For further details on the method used to conduct this assessment see here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

While close to 72% of amphibians are considered Well Protected, 22% are Poorly or Not Protected. Species-specific management within protected areas is generally lacking for amphibians, with 7% (9 species) assessed as less well protected once Protected Area management effectiveness are taken into account. For the 75 endemic amphibians assessed, 57% are Well Protected, 17% (13 species) are Not Protected, and a further 17% (13 species) are Poorly Protected.

Examples of threatened species that have benefitted from improved protection include the Endangered micro frog (Microbatrachella capensis), Pickersgill’s reed frog (Hyperolius pickersgilli), and the Cape platanna (Xenopus gilli). In the case of H. pickersgilli, an additional 16 sites have been confirmed for the species since 2017, with several of these occurring within protected areas7.\nHabitat protection gains have been a key outcome of the coordination of the Biodiversity Management Plan for this species, with several sites (totalling 127 hectares) being declared through the Biodiversity Stewardship Programme, as well as improved management and wetland health for these, and existing protected areas7. For M. capensis, confirmation of the species in the Nuwejaars Wetlands Special Management Area in 2021, which is now being managed with the frog as a management target, has resulted in both an expansion of the species’ range with protected areas as well as improved management effectiveness scores from fair to good.

    "text": "Species recovery\nAs part of the Red List process for southern Africa, the Amphibian Ark (AArk) joined the expert workshop and worked with coordinators to produce a Conservation Needs Assessment (CNA) for threatened South African amphibian species8. This used a process developed by AArk to determine which species have the most urgent conservation needs, based on action plans that combine in situ and ex situ actions, as appropriate. Six South African species were identified for ex situ conservation actions, including ex situ rescue (n = 5) and ex situ research (n = 1). Due to their level of threat, the five species recommended for ex situ rescue are also recommended for biobanking. Twenty-five species were recommended for in situ conservation, and 34 species are recommended for in situ research, while 15 species were identified for conservation education programs.\nIn addition, subsequent work to identify species requiring urgent recovery under Target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework resulted in 10 species being prioritised. This includes threatened endemic species and those of regional importance that might go extinct even if their habitat is protected. This highlights the limited targeted management of amphibians within protected areas and the need for research on how they respond to management interventions.\nSouth Africa has a relatively proactive community working on amphibian conservation and research, with NGOs, provincial authorities and various universities contributing to building conservation evidence for assessing the effectiveness of conservation interventions and growing the body of knowledge on amphibian taxonomy, behaviour and ecology (Table 3). These activities were partially guided by the conservation and research strategy compiled following the 2010 Red List assessments9, demonstrating the value of these processes, with plans in place to update this strategy following the most recent assessments (2025). While progress has been made, amphibian conservation capacity remains overlooked and underfunded compared to other taxa10, and this is particularly pertinent in the African context, with limited resources in general, and the constant need to balance development needs with conservation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Pickersgill’s reed frog: conservation action at work\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example of coordinated conservation action for Pickersgill’s reed frog (Hyperolius pickersgilli) provides a good case study of a relatively long-term recovery project in which new knowledge has not only resulted in a threat status reduction (from Critically Endangered in 2010 to Endangered in 2016), but also in concerted efforts to understand and mitigate threats. Stemming from recommendations in the 2011 Strategy for Conservation Research9, a Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) was co-developed between key stakeholders and has resulted in many achievements over the past decade, including improvements in knowledge of distribution, genetics and habitat requirements, implementation of monitoring protocols, a captive breeding program, improved habitat protection gains (including a biodiversity offset) and improved habitat management. Research related to the project was published in four peer-reviewed articles and has contributed to seven post-graduate studies. Of the 16 actions identified for the first iteration of the BMP, 17% had been completed, 65% were on track, 6% had minor issues, and a further 12% were still in the planning phase by 2022. Overall, 24 participating organisations have been involved, and implementation of actions resulted in direct employment of over 150 people across institutions as well as stimulating an influx of funding to support actions7. In 2008 the species was known from less than 10 sites; today it is known to occur at almost 40 localities, and multiple breeding wetlands within these localities. The BMP helped strengthen government support as well as improved integration of research outputs into spatial planning and environmental compliance. Interest in the project also generated vast exposure, including television, signage and social media campaigns, reaching thousands of people. While this species’ range continues to be within an area of rapid transformation, this project has resulted in the species improving its protection level from Poorly Protected in 2018 to Moderately Protected in 2025. This demonstrates the successes that can be achieved through collaboration and the commitment of partners from a range of influences.\n\nRelease site for captive-bred Pickersgill’s reed frog in 2018 when 400 captive-bred individuals were released back into the wild through collaboration between Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Joburg Zoo and the Endangered Wildlife Trust.

    "section": "Knowledge gaps",
    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nWhile amphibians globally remain the most threatened (41%) vertebrates on Earth, basic data on species distribution, population numbers, and ecology remain poor. This is likely partly a result of limited funding, with amphibians receiving the least conservation funding of all major groups globally. Less than 2.8% of funding support is directed to amphibians, and this has declined from 4% in the 1990s10. Projects on amphibians are also often focussed on multiple species, limiting per species investment. This differs from projects focussed on other taxa that often receive disproportional support, including for non-threatened species (e.g., large mammals). This lack of funding is likely the root cause of several knowledge gaps discussed below and is also linked to inadequate capacity in amphibian research and conservation. These gaps are even more acute outside of South Africa in other parts of the continent.\nSimilarly, despite major efforts in recent decades to improve knowledge on amphibian declines, there remains a disconnect between research and its translation into conservation actions. Research priorities identified at the global scale include a better understanding of the effects of climate change, community-level drivers of declines, methodological improvements for research and monitoring, genomics, and effects of land-use change. Improved inclusion of under-represented amphibian species in conservation projects was also highlighted4. In South Africa, growing amphibian conservation and research capacity in a more representative way is critical to addressing capacity gaps and providing skills transfer to young researchers to grow core conservation expertise.\nIn the red listing process for amphibians, Criterion B (Geographic range information) is primarily used to inform most assessments. Research projects that generate population data, both over time and in response to threats and management interventions, will be useful to strengthen amphibian Red List assessments, and in turn to provide baseline data for adaptive conservation strategies. Using the outputs from red listing, including recommended conservation and research actions, is crucial for prioritising and guiding future conservation strategies, and such strategies have been found to be effective in improving taxonomy, ecological studies, monitoring, research outputs, and capacity building11.",

    "text": "Approach\nThreat status assessment\nAll previously assessed South African amphibians were reassessed as part of the Southern African Amphibian Red List Project (SAARLP) that commenced in 2023, as part the third global amphibian assessment process, supported by the IUCN Amphibian Specialist Group and Amphibian Red List Authority. A total of 135 species were assessed for publication on the IUCN Red List in 2025 and 2026, including 11 newly described species since 201612. Over 150 000 records were collated for the assessments, including from various institutions and verified citizen science data. Twenty experts representing thirteen organisations contributed to the assessment process.\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a ‘persistence target’ for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends not only on the area protected but also on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assessment was applied to 133 amphibian species with the persistence target set at the area required to protect 10 000 individuals.\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas — quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target of 10 000 individuals falls within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness — adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes, etc. are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood, when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major threats;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major threats to species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major threats to the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.\nThe above analysis was first undertaken for NBA 2018 and was repeated in 2025 using updated species occurrence data based on the 2025 Amphibian Red List Reassessment. A spatial layer of protected areas for 2018 and 2025 representing protected areas that were declared at that time were used for the two time periods. A technical report outlining the full methodology and limitations will be available in February 2026.",

    "text": "Threat status\nA total of 506 marine species have been assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria and are included in the NBA, drawing from a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Of these, approximately 36% of taxa are threatened in 2025, while 18% of 376 assessed species were threatened in 2018. This difference is due to the inclusion of additional species (including all sharks, rays and chimaeras, additional corals and selected marine invertebrates), many of which are threatened. However, the high proportion of threatened taxa is not fully representative of the extinction risks at the realm level because there has been a focus on assessing economically important species and groups known to be at risk (such as corals, sharks, rays and chimaeras, rock lobsters and abalone). The lack of comprehensively assessed marine taxonomic groups leads to an inflated bias of threat results.\n\nFiguresData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Consequently, ~8% of species were assessed as Data Deficient, the highest among the four realms. Limited assessment efforts signal the need to address knowledge gaps and increase capacity for foundational research on marine species (including taxonomy and strengthened distribution data) and comprehensive IUCN Red List assessments for entire taxonomic groups.\nA comprehensive assessment of cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) was included in NBA 2025 drawing from global and national assessments, with this group emerging as one of the most threatened groups across all realms (41% threatened; Figure 1A). Many cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, with slow growth and low reproductive output, and are thus inherently vulnerable to fishing. Many cartilaginous species are also wide-ranging and much of their declines can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other regions. However, 42% of South Africa’s endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened (Figure 1B), indicating that the country has an important role in reversing declines of these species. Endemic species at highest risk of extinction include the happy Eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsi) and twineye skate (Raja miraletus), both assessed as Endangered. Globally and in South Africa, the main threats to sharks are unsustainable fishing as target and bycatch species1,pollom2024b?. In South Africa, cartilaginous fishes are caught as target and bycatch species in industrial fisheries, targeted catch in recreational fisheries, and in bather protection shark nets.\n\n\n\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead is Critically Endangered.

    "section": "Trends – the Red List Index",
    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe Red List Index (RLI)2 for top predators such as sharks, shows deteriorating threat status over time (Figure 2). As apex and meso-predators, sharks perform a range of essential ecological functions in marine food webs, including controlling the populations of their prey, maintaining diversity at lower trophic levels (that include commercially fished species), and maintaining functional coastal and marine ecosystems3. Loss of top predators, therefore, has potential knock-on effects on the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities and food security.\nThe decline in shark populations is a global trend, where the main threats to sharks are fisheries (as both target catch and bycatch), habitat loss and degradation, and climate change4,5,pollom2024b?. As most of South Africa’s 191 shark species have ranges that extend well beyond South African waters, some of the decline in the RLI for South Africa’s sharks reflects fishing pressure and other threats beyond South Africa’s jurisdiction. When national adjustments in threat status are taken into account, the South African RLI is marginally higher and the declining trend is marginally less steep than the global RLI for the same set of species. Nevertheless, 6 of South Africa’s 13 endemic sharks are threatened with global extinction, with their future fully dependent on conservation and fisheries management actions in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Red List Index (RLI) for marine species assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the closer the group of species is to extinction (with 0 representing extinction).\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 10 (24%) of South Africa’s 42 seabreams (sparids) are at risk of extinction with two Critically Endangered, four Endangered and four Vulnerable species Figure 1A. The dageraad (Chrysoblephus cristiceps) and red steenbras (Petrus rupestris) are Critically Endangered6,7, with Endangered taxa including seventy-four (Polysteganus undulosus)8, red stumpnose (Chrysoblephus gibbiceps), West Coast and white steenbras (Lithognathus aureti and L. lithognathus, respectively).\nSeabream trends remain relatively stable (Figure 2) with some species uplisted and others downlisted. Since the previous assessments in 2009, three seabreams have improved in terms of threat status including the seventy-four (Polysteganus undulosus), from Critically Endangered to Endangered, red roman (Chrysoblephus laticeps) from Near Threatened to Least Concern and carpenter (Argyrozona argyrozona) from Near Threatened to Least Concern. Effective fisheries management measures and marine protected areas (MPAs) have supported recovery of some of these linefish. Two taxa became more threatened, namely the red steenbras (Petrus rupestrus), from Endangered to Critically Endangered, and the West Coast steenbras (Lithognathus auretti), from Near Threatened to Endangered. Overfishing by recreational fisheries are a particular concern for these two species.\nSouth African kob species (Argyrosomus genus) – including dusky, silver, squaretail, and West Coast dusky kob – are highly valued food fish targeted by recreational, commercial and small-scale fishers, and are also caught as trawl bycatch. Once abundant, the populations of dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus), silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) and squaretail kob (Argyrosomus thorpei) have collapsed, largely due to a long history of overexploitation and habitat degradation. Dusky kob has been nationally assessed as Critically Endangered, and the assessment is being finalised, whilst squaretail and silver kob have been assessed as Endangered and Vulnerable respectively9.\nThese sciaenids are inherently vulnerable to exploitation: they are large, relatively slow growing and late maturing, spawn in predictable aggregations, and their juveniles show varying degrees of dependence on estuaries and their critical ecosystem functions (such as food provision and refuge from predators). Their susceptibility to overfishing is worsened by habitat degradation from sedimentation, freshwater flow reduction, pollution, and agricultural runoff. Similar appearances of multiple species complicate identification by fishers in the field, challenging effective species-specific management. Current regulations are inadequate, particularly for the large recreational sector, while climate change and the declining quality and quantity of estuarine habitats pose additional threats (Box 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. South Africa co-developed a conservation strategy to improve the threat and stock status of kobs9.\n\n\n\n\n\n A collaborative conservation strategy involving government and non-government stakeholders established five key objectives: (1) reform current regulations with public engagement; (2) foster stewardship among users and managers; (3) enhance spatial protection of spawning sites, nurseries, and bycatch hotspots; (4) ensure adequate freshwater flow to estuaries; and (5) address critical research gaps. Each objective includes specific actions, responsible parties, priorities, and timelines.\nThe strategy invites researchers, fishers, conservationists, and decision-makers to contribute toward the long-term vision of recovering kob populations to sustainable levels in South Africa.\n\n\n\nFour of South Africa’s six marine reptiles are threatened (Figure 1A), with three of five turtles at risk from fisheries bycatch or incidental mortalities. Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are regionally Critically Endangered and are a conservation priority. South Africa’s only sea snake is Least Concern.\nSeabirds are the most threatened group of birds globally and in South Africa, where approximately 39% are threatened (Figure 1A). Albatrosses and petrels are the most threatened groups of seabirds, with incidental mortality linked to industrial trawl and longline fisheries posing a major threat (see Subantarctic page). All seven seabird species endemic to the southern Benguela are threatened, with worsening trends for three species over the last decade. Endemic seabird species include three species that predominantly feed on small pelagic fish (primarily anchovy and sardine), namely the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus; now globally Critically Endangered), Cape cormorant (Phalacrocorax capensis; Endangered) and Cape gannet (Morus capensis; Vulnerable)10. The threat status of these seabirds is driven by competition with the purse-seine fishery11, predation12, and climate change. Crowned cormorant (Microcarbo coronatus; Near Threatened to Vulnerable) and Hartlaub’s gull (Chroicocephalus hartlaubii; Least Concern to Vulnerable) were uplisted due to a combination of pressures including human disturbance at breeding colonies, predation and diseases. Bank cormorants (Phalacrocorax neglectus; Endangered) are threatened by the decline of their major prey species, West Coast rock lobster (Box 4), and breeding failure, due to extreme weather patterns associated with climate change and human disturbance.\nEight of 50 (16%) marine mammals are threatened (Figure 1A), with the Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) being a key species of concern in South African waters (Box 2)13. A major pressure is shark control measures, with pollution, coastal development and shipping also contributing to the threat status of this species. Marine mammals show a positive trend (Figure 2) due to the improvement in status of a subantarctic species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), which was recently downlisted from Near Threatened to Least Concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. The most threatened marine mammal in South Africa, the Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, is at risk of extinction due to threats such as pollution, lethal shark control measures, shipping and coastal development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are likely less than 500 individuals of Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphins in South Africa. (© Brett Atkins)\n\n\n\nRecently reassessed, nationally and globally, the status of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) remains Endangered and the situation is dire, but not without hope. A major threat to humpback dolphins - incidental bycatch in the lethal shark control programme in KwaZulu-Natal has been reduced following changes in fishing gear. However, levels of chemical pollutants in humpback dolphins, including persistent organic pollutants (also known as ‘forever chemicals’) and heavy metals, continue to be the highest of any marine mammal in South Africa and amongst the highest globally14. Shipping and coastal development are other major threats. The cumulative effects of multiple stressors, which are difﬁcult to pinpoint and mitigate, are impacting this small population that is currently estimated to be fewer than 500 individuals. The recent expansion of South Africa’s MPA coverage (e.g., uThukela Banks MPA) may have a help this species, but pressures need better management, both inside and outside protected areas. National efforts are underway through the South African Humpback Dolphin Consortium (SOUSA Consortium) in collaboration with the DFFE to develop a National Biodiversity Management Plan. This remains a top priority to ensure the long‐term survival of the species in South Africa. International collaboration is being strengthened with the recent formation of the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin Conservation Network (HuDoNET), linking scientists and conservationists across the species’ range.\n\n\n\nDue to poor taxonomic knowledge and a paucity of occurrence records, most marine invertebrates cannot be assessed. However, shallow water reef-building corals were assessed globally and a sample of beach macrofauna and key invertebrate resources were assessed nationally. Globally, corals are now the second-most threatened species group after cycads. Of the 128 South African shallow reef-building corals assessed globally, 34% are threatened (Figure 1A) due to climate change (key message A1). Many of these are within the Acroporidae family. There are three Endangered Montipora coral species in South Africa. They are sensitive to thermal stress and are often the first taxa to show signs of bleaching, thus providing an early warning of climate stress in South Africa’s coral reef ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa experienced the worst coral bleaching observed to date in 2025, although this is still far less than more severe mass bleaching events recorded in other parts of the world. Coral bleaching is the loss of symbiotic algae, triggered by elevated sea temperatures and other environmental stressors, leaving corals white and compromised, often leading to mortality. (© Kerry Sink)\n\n\n\nCorals show the steepest trend in worsening threat status (Figure 2), noting that these are global assessments with no national assessments conducted to date. South Africa’s shallow water reef building corals and stony corals, have experienced less coral bleaching and may be less threatened than elsewhere in the region and globally15,16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. South African abalone remains in crisis and was assessed as Endangered by the IUCN in 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndemic South African abalone (Haliotis midae) is Endangered. (© Steve Benjamin)\n\n\n\nHaliotis midae, commonly known as perlemoen, was listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 202117 due to the collapse of what was once a thriving commercial fishery that peaked at 2 800 tons in 1965. A total allowable catch for the fishery of only 12 tons was announced for the 2025/2026 fishing season. The legal commercial fishery, allocated quotas across seven zones in the Western Cape, has been systematically undermined and overwhelmed by industrial-scale illegal fishing operations. Organised criminal gangs, linked to international drug trafficking, have exploited this species at catastrophic levels, with illegal harvests estimated at over 2 000 tons annually, compared to disproportionately small legal quotas. Population surveys reveal widespread recruitment failure throughout all commercial zones, as illegal fishing targets predominantly immature individuals below the legal minimum size, preventing reproduction and causing population densities to fall below levels necessary for successful breeding. The IUCN assessment predicts a continued steep decline in spawning biomass through 2035, with recovery likely requiring a 59% reduction in illegal fishing harvest via robust enforcement measures.\n\n\n\nAssessments from a small sample of utilised marine invertebrates in South Africa (10 spiny lobsters, abalone and the white mussel) found that four of the 12 resource species are threatened. South African abalone (Haliotis midae; Box 3), white mussel (Donax serra) and West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii; Box 4) are all Endangered, signalling the need to support recovery of these species. A strategy to develop marine species Red Listing in South Africa was developed in 2024 with a focus on marine invertebrates18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. West Coast rock lobster is nationally assessed as Endangered with its status driven largely by illegal fishing and exacerbated by environmental changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) was assessed as Endangered in 2025. (© Geoff Spiby)\n\n\n\nThe West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii), was globally assessed as Least Concern in 200919 as part of international efforts to assess crustaceans. However, a national assessment in 2025 found this species to be Endangered, primarily due to severe population decline, with exploitable biomass falling by 68% over the past three generations (45 years) and current stock levels at only 1.2% of pre-fished levels from 1910. The species faces overwhelming pressure from illegal fishing, which is estimated to remove more than twice as much biomass annually as legal fishing operations. Total allowable catch for the fishery was reduced by 91% from over 5 000 tons in the late 1970s to just 505 tons in 2024/2025, reflecting the resource’s dire condition. A small positive trend in the recent stock assessment has led to an increased allocation of 800 tons for the 2025/26 fishing season, however, the resource remains at significantly reduced levels and requires cautious management. Environmental stresses have compounded fishing pressures, including significant reductions in somatic growth rates since the 1990s, mass strandings caused by low oxygen events (with an estimated 2 000 tons lost in the 1997 event), and an eastward distribution shift that has disrupted traditional fishing areas. Climate change effects, including increased frequency of algal blooms and hypoxic conditions, continue to threaten the species through habitat degradation and physiological stress. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is slow-growing with a 15-year generation length and a complex life cycle that includes an extended larval stage. Despite decades of management measures including minimum size limits, seasonal restrictions, and operational management procedures, the combination of heavy illegal fishing pressure and environmental change has pushed this economically important species into crisis20.\n\n\n\nThe endemic South Coast rock lobster (Palinurus gilchristi) (Box 5) was assessed as Vulnerable in 2025 due to current overfishing, with historical illegal fishing also a key contributing factor. Abalone and South Coast rock lobster are endemic and their assessments are global, but the West Coast rock lobster assessment is a national assessment. Assessments for other rock lobster species occurring in South Africa are global assessments and all are considered to be Least Concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. A national assessment of South Coast rock lobster revealed that it is Vulnerable due to overexploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Coast rock lobster (Palinurus gilchristi) was assessed as Vulnerable in 2025. (© ACEP Deep Forests project, Kerry Sink)\n\n\n\nThe South Coast rock lobster (Palinurus gilchristi), was nationally assessed as Vulnerable in 2025, using the IUCN Red List criteria. The status was primarily due to historical overexploitation that caused significant population declines over the past three generations (48 years). The species’ exploitable biomass has declined by 35% since the 1977/1978 fishing season, with current stock assessments indicating spawning biomass is at 41% of pre-fished levels. A major contributing factor was illegal over-harvesting by one company between 1987-2001, which significantly exceeded fishing quotas and caused concurrent decreases in both biomass and catch rates. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is long-lived (up to 30 years), slow-growing, and does not reach sexual maturity until about 10 years of age. While improved management measures, including reduced quotas and fishing effort controls, have led to some recovery in recent years, the cumulative decline over three generations still qualifies the species for Vulnerable status under IUCN Red List criteria A 2d.\n\n\n\nTwenty South African sandy beach macrofaunal species were recently assessed21 and are the first beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List globally. Of these, four (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further three (15%) are Near Threatened. Species of concern include the pillbugs (Tylos granulatus; Endangered) and (Tylos capensis; Endangered), the beach ground beetle (Acanthoscelis ruficornis; Endangered) and the white mussel (Donax serra; Endangered) (Box 6, coast species). The pressures on beach macrofauna include mining on the West Coast, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, overfishing, and removal of washed-up kelp from the shore (see pressures page).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 6. White mussel is now Endangered primarily due to overharvesting\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white mussel (Donax serra), is listed as Endangered primarily due to severe (50-80%) population declines over the past decade. This evidence is drawn from commercial fishery data showing catch-per-unit-effort more than halving and an approximately 80% reduction in total catch in South Africa. The species faces multiple compounding threats, with commercial and recreational harvesting being the primary driver, particularly after management changes in 2007 switched from total allowable catch limits to effort-based regulations. This regulatory change led to reported harvests increasing from about 50 000 individuals annually in the 1990s-2000s to 1-1.45 million individuals per year after 2007/2008. Mining activities, which affect about 20-25% of the species’ range, cause significant habitat degradation by changing beach sand grain size through tailings deposits. The resultant sediment is too coarse for the clams to burrow and effectively eliminates them from affected sites. Resurveyed beaches show dramatic declines, with abundance at four sites near Plettenberg Bay dropping to only 24-48% of 1980s levels. Anecdotal reports from both Namibia and South Africa describe former abundance hotspots where the species is now extremely difficult to find. The species is restricted to fine-sand beach habitats and has limited dispersal abilities despite a pelagic larvae, challenging its recovery from population depletions amongst multiple ongoing stressors across its range.",

    "text": "Species stock status\nStock assessments are conducted for fisheries species and constitute a rigorous approach to assessing species’ resource status. Stock status is distinct from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species status, which assesses extinction risk, although stock status and fisheries catch trends are often a key informant in IUCN Red List assessments.\nImprovements in stock assessment methods, particularly for data-sparse species, have enabled more species to be assessed since the last NBA. A total of 65 stocks were assessed in South Africa in 2025. Of the assessed resources, 32% are depleted or heavily depleted and 43% are abundant or optimally exploited (Figure 4). The stock status of the remaining quarter of assessed marine resources remains unknown due to insufficient knowledge and data22 (Figure 4).\nEffective science-based management has supported stock recovery of the carpenter seabream (Argyrozona argyrozona) and the roman seabream (Chrysoblephus laticeps) in the last two decades23. Important resources such as silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) remain depleted, despite signs of improvement from its previous heavily depleted state; whilst dusky kob (A. japonicus), dageraad (Chrysoblephus cristiceps) and red steenbras (Petrus rupestris) remain heavily depleted and are yet to show significant signs of stock recovery. Importantly, the seventy-four seabream (Polysteganus undulosus) is showing the first signals of recovery following a 27-year moratorium imposed on capture of this species (see sparid page). Recovery of many linefish species has been hampered by their life history characteristics, including slow growth, late maturity, hermaphroditism and residency, which make them vulnerable to exploitation. Whilst the linefish emergency declared in 2000 has supported stock recovery through a reduction in exploitation24, many linefish remain unassessed or depleted and are sought after in the open-access recreational fishery and the newly recognised small-scale fishery. Recent recommendations focus on more holistic ecosystem-based management for the line fishery25 that recognises the complexities of multiple sectors, species, and interacting socio-economics. Harmonised policy and fisheries governance (across commercial, recreational and small-scale sectors) can enable more equitable sharing of limited linefish resources could aid species recovery and maximise economic and social benefits25.\nLarge pelagic resources such as southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are depleted. While very few sharks and rays have fisheries stock assessments, many of those assessed still have too little data to assign a stock status and have been listed as unknown. Where data are sufficient, several are in a poor state, with soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus) being heavily depleted, and shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus), dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), happy Eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsii), yellowspotted skate (Leucoraja wallacei) and twineye skate (Raja miraletus) assessed as depleted. As apex predators, sharks and rays play an important role in marine food webs. Currently, sharks and rays are targeted in the demersal shark longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal bather-protection shark nets, and are caught as bycatch in several fisheries, including the large pelagic longline fishery. Urgent effort is needed to halt the rapid decline in shark and ray resources. Management strategies such as the published National Plan of Action for Sharks IIunknown-a? and the draft National Shark Biodiversity Plan26 make recommendations for improved fisheries and biodiversity elements of cartilaginous fishes management. Implementing these recommendations, particularly through a coordinated approach that provides for integrated shark and ray conservation, is needed to secure South Africa’s globally significant shark, ray and chimaera biodiversity (see shark and ray page).\nTraditional fishing resources such as snoek (Thyrsites atun) and commercially important resources such as shallow-water hake (Merluccius capensis) remain abundant with deep-water hake (Merluccius paradoxus) being optimally exploited.\nThe stock status of invertebrates such as white mussel (Donax serra) and octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were assessed as unknown, despite the use of these resources gaining popularity and white mussel being assessed as Endangered by the IUCN (Box 6). Abalone (Haliotis midae) and West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) remain heavily depleted due to illegal resource use.\nTo ensure fair and sustainable fisheries that support ocean life and human livelihoods, effective fisheries management plans should be implemented for all sectors, to manage the impacts on ecosystems, species, genes and people (see key message A5 and marine priority actions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

    "text": "Approach\nFor the species of the marine realm, we report on species assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in terms of extinction risk and the state of resource species for which stock status is assessed.\nSouth Africa’s IUCN Red List assessment work is coordinated by SANBI’s Threatened Species Programme but is conducted by groups of species specialists. A total of 506 South African marine species have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria through a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Assessments of sharks, rays and chimaeras, sparids, and corals were undertaken by the IUCN species specialist groups, with many species assessed using global assessments. However, 33 species of cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) were assessed nationally, meaning that the IUCN criteria were applied to the portions of the populations that occur in South Africa’s water. Adjustments were undertaken for species where we had sufficient data to show that extinction risk trends were different from global trends.\nThe NBA 2025 assessment includes IUCN Red List assessments for kobs conducted as part of South Africa’s kob conservation strategy9, the first assessments for beach invertebrate fauna, assessments for selected marine invertebrate resource species and compilation of global coral assessments for shallow water coral species that occor in South Africa. Seabirds were regionally assessed by BirdLife South Africa, mammals were regionally assessed by the Endangered Wildlife Trust and reptiles were assessed using a combination of global and regional assessments.\nThe trend in species IUCN Red List status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI). The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1; if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The slope of the line connecting different assessment periods indicates the rate of change in the average RLI. Sharks, rays and chimaeras, sparids, and corals were included in the RLI for the first time in 2025.\nInformation about resource stock status is drawn from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment’s State of Fishery Resources reports22 to provide an overview of species stock status for fished taxa and examine main trends in marine resources over the assessment period.",

To date, many freshwater-dependent taxa have not been included in IUCN Red List assessments due to the lack of comprehensive taxonomic understanding as well as limited distribution data. South Africa, as a mega-diverse country, is not likely to ever have the capacity to assess all known freshwater species, and hence groups included provide important insight into the conditions experienced by freshwater species.\nNine freshwater groups are included in this assessment, including, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles (reassessed and completed within the last three years (2023 to 2025)), and for the first time, freshwater crabs and fairy shrimps (Anostraca)(assessed in 2024 and 2025 respectively). Further, Freshwater fishes and Odonata have not had their Red List assessments updated since the 2018 NBA, and here we present the findings of the 2018 assessments. These groups are due for reassessment in the next two years (2026/27). Freshwater plants are represented by a small sample (27 from a 900-representative sample of all plants). A more comprehensive assessment of freshwater plants has been identified as a priority to be able to accurately report on their threat status in South Africa.\nIn general, most freshwater groups show high sensitivity to multiple pressures, the most serious being the loss of natural habitat owing to habitat modification, e.g., wetland drainage, pollution of river systems, agricultural and housing developments, over-abstraction of water, and the impacts of invasive alien species and climate change. Of all the assessed freshwater species, 20% (131 taxa) are classified as threatened (CR, CR(PE), EN and VU) with extinction, when accounting for other taxa of conservation concern (ToCC) (threatened species, DD, Rare and NT), these include 31% (206) of assessed taxa (see details on the Red List assessment process here. Further, 32% (201 taxa) of assessed taxa are endemic to South Africa, of which 42% (90 taxa) are threatened with extinction, meaning the responsibility to protect these species and prevent further losses rests solely with South Africa.\n\nFiguresData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

For a full reflection on entire taxonomic groups, please click on the headings to access the subsections of the website under Species findings.\n\nFairy shrimps\nSouth African fairy shrimps (Anostraca) species represent habitat specialists that occupy temporary freshwater habitats. Of the 36 species assessed, 25% (9 species) were found to be threatened with extinction (Figure 1 and Table 1). The main driver of threat was habitat loss and degradation due to urban expansion and agricultural activities. These species’ habitats are varied and include endorheic (internally drained) wetlands, remnant riverine pools, rock pools, roadside ditches, and even animal wallows. These habitats are not permanent features in the landscape and hence are impacted by activities when they are not inundated. An increase in awareness is needed to protect these highly diverse and dynamic habitats. In recent years, there has been some interest in sampling and identifying these species using both morphology and genetic tools. This has led to the discovery of new species1, as well as range extensions.\nIn 2023, the first comprehensive assessment of South African Anostraca was initiated through the NRF FBIP REFRESH Project. This contributes 58% of the global Anostraca IUCN assessments, making a sizeable contribution to the understanding of the current state of these temporary freshwater habitat indicator species.\n\n\nFreshwater fishes\nSouth Africa’s freshwater fishes are the second most threatened comprehensively assessed taxonomic group (see ecosystem threat status), with 36% (42 taxa) assessed as threatened, and when only considering endemics, 66% (38) are threatened (Figure 1 and Table 1). Freshwater fish have not been reassessed since 2018, but field observations and the status of South African rivers and wetlands indicate that pressures have not ceased and continue to mount (see freshwater ecosystem condition)). A breakthrough for this group since the last assessment in 2018 has been an immense investment in the expansion of the taxonomic understanding of many freshwater fishes, through resolving species complexes and describing new species[see box X - REFRESH ]. These taxonomic advances are critical to enable Red List assessment updates. Along with taxonomic updates of many species, a large number of field surveys have improved our understanding of active threats and the condition of the habitats of many fishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteREFRESH, filling the gaps on freshwater species\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NRF Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP) RREFRESH project aimed to address knowledge gaps for seven freshwater taxonomic groups, incuding freshwater fishes, mollusca, large branchiopoda (fairy shrimps), freshwater crabs, freshwater fish parasites, amphibians and odonata species. Each group idnetified specific aims, for improving data to inform a better understanding of species delineation, species distributions, habitat condition and identification of pressures. Along with these aims, capacity building, student training and raising awareness of freshwater species were also outcomes that was focused on. More than 40 co-investigators and collaborators have contributed to the project that started in 2021, ending in 2024 as part of the Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP). Data produced through this project, as contributed to Red Listing, expansion of DNA barcoding collections, and will be used to establish and update baselines data, for assessing change patterns, river and wetland condition and to inform strategic freshwater management and decision-making.\n\n\n\nMajor pressures that have persisted for freshwater fishes and their habitat are competition with invasive alien fish and degradation of their freshwater habitat through water abstraction, pollution, and inappropriate sedimentation. Many emerging pressures have been identified through recent surveys, but their impacts on freshwater fishes will be interpreted and accounted for within the next update of the Red List of South African freshwater fishes. Of particular concern is illegal mining activity in the north-eastern regions of the country within river systems hosting highly threatened and restricted fishes (e.g. Enteromius treurensis) see Box 2.\nThe current list of freshwater fishes excludes migratory fishes such as the eel species present in South African freshwater and marine realms, thus representing a knowledge gap. Further work is required to enable comprehensive reporting on the state of migratory fish species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. New active pressures in river systems that are impacting highly threatened species\n\n\n\n\n\nUnregulated or illigal gold mining (commonly referred to as zama-zama activities in South Africa) presents an escalating threat to the Blyde, Sabi and lower Crocodile River tributaries in the Mpumalanga Province. Expansion of these activities is currently occurring with limited law enforcement or coordinated institutional response. Impacts include physical disturbance of riverbeds and banks, and the use of mercury and cyanide for gold extraction, with consequent cumulative risks to aquatic biota.\nThe Blyde River population of Enteromius treurensis (CR) is of particular concern. Habitat degradation in this system has intensified to the extent that extinction of this taxon in the near future is plausible if current pressures persist. The scale and nature of impacts indicate that an effective response will require coordinated, cross-sectoral intervention across relevant government departments.\n\n\n\nMap illustrating a section of the river impacted by unregulated informal mining activities along the Blyde River, Mpumalanga Province. (© Francios Roux)\n\n\n\nThe upper Blyde River near Pilgrim’s Rest, illustrating habitat impacts by informal and unregulated gold mining activities. (© Francios Roux)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirds\nThere are 166 birds associated with freshwater ecosystems (waterbirds), and of these, 133 have been assessed using the IUCN Regional Red List. Of these waterbirds, 14% (19 species) of the species are threatened with extinction and 28% (37 species) are taxa of conservation concern (TOCC) (threatened species, DD, Rare and NT) (Figure 1 and Table 1). Since the 2015 Red List assessment, there has been a sharp decline in the status of many waterbird species, with many species recently being uplisted from Least Concern to an IUCN threat category (see Box 3). Of the thirty-nine bird species that have been uplisted to a higher threat category, nineteen are waterbirds (48% of uplisted birds are water birds).\n\n\n\n\nThe greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is assesses as Near-Threatened in South Africa, an iconic wetland species, while recent CWAC data indicate population declines within the assessment region. (© Martin Taylor, AvesAfrica)\n\n\n\n An few examples is the African darter (Anhinga rufa) which has experienced a significant decline in its habitat availability through habitat loss (e.g. wetland drainage), impacts on breeding sites and environmental pollution (e.g. pesticide use and run-off, effluent). The maccoa duck (Oxyura maccoa), has been uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable, due to the impacts of invasive alien species (e.g., water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)) in its wetland habitats. The half-collared kingfisher (VU) (Alcedo semitorquata) provides an example of a habitat specialist dependent on fast-flowing, clear, perennial streams and rivers that offer sheltered conditions and dense marginal vegetation. These types of habitats are increasingly threatened by pollution, siltation, and reduced flow due to over-abstraction of water and prolonged drought.\n\n\n\n\nYellow-billed stork (Phoenicopterus roseus), is globally Least Concern, but in South Africa it is assessed as Vulnerable due to loss of habitat in wetlands, on which it depends for foraging. (© Martin Taylor, AvesAfrica)\n\n\n\n Besides habitat loss, many of these waterbirds are congregatory in nature, which makes them vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Waterbirds merit increased protection at key protected areas to prevent accelerated rates of decline. Urban freshwater habitats present unique opportunities for citizen-led habitat restoration and monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Waterbirds are declining in South Africa, based on the most recent Regional assessment for South African birds led by BirdLife South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nWaterbirds are integral to the healthy ecological function of wetland and temporary aquatic systems, where they contribute to nutrient cycling, regulate plant and insect populations, and act as sensitive indicators of ecosystem health. Their presence signals functioning temporary habitats such as pans, mudflats, and ephemeral wetlands that support a wide range of biodiversity. Because many waterbirds depend on shallow, short-lived waterbodies, any change in hydroperiod, water quality, or habitat structure quickly affects their survival, breeding and migration.\nRecent monitoring through the Coordinated Waterbird Count (CWAC) programme shows that many waterbird species are declining, likely driven by prolonged droughts, climate-driven shifts in rainfall and temperature, and the resulting destabilisation of temporary wetlands. Climate change is altering the timing, depth, and duration of seasonal waterbodies, causing species like flamingos to disappear when pans dry too quickly or become too deep, and affecting species tied to specific habitat types such as mudflats or riverine thickets.\nHuman pressures are amplifying these trends. Wetlands are drained for agriculture and development, polluted by runoff and waste, disturbed by recreation, and invaded by alien plants that choke natural systems. In general, dams and diversions reduce river flow, while farm dams in particular provide poor-quality substitutes with depleted food webs. These combined pressures threaten species entirely dependent on intact wetlands. Conservation frameworks such as the Ramsar Convention — supported by monitoring efforts like CWAC — are critical to protecting temporary wetland systems, sustaining waterbird populations, and maintaining the broader ecological functions they underpin.\nMonitoring waterbirds is vital to see how they are navigating these types of change. You can get involved by joining citizen-science monitoring programmes like CWAC to track changes and inform conservation actions. Visit cwac.birdmap.africa or enquire at your local bird club to find out more.\n\n\n\n\n\nReptiles\nOf the 407 reptile species indigenous to South Africa, 15 species are dependent on freshwater habitats. Four of the 15 species (20%) are taxa of conservation concern (ToCC), three of these are assessed as Vulnerable, and one is assessed as Data Deficient (Figure 1 and Table 1). The major pressures on these ToCC are natural system modification and pollution, which are impacting all threatened species, followed by 66% of ToCC impacted by agricultural and mining activities, causing habitat degradation (Figure 3). Climate change and its associated effects on weather patterns and temperature have been identified as a current or potential future threat to some threatened reptile species. However, more monitoring is required to fully understand these impacts in South Africa. Increase in intensity of fires and a change in the timing of seasonal burns may affect these species during their hibernation period. While no freshwater-associated species have experienced a change in their IUCN Red List status, resulting in the RLI remaining stable, there has still been a continuation and exacerbation of pressures within these species’ habitats.\nSee the Conservation assessment of South African reptiles for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Risks of alien freshwater crayfish introductions to South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien freshwater crayfish have been widely introduced worldwide for aquaculture and the pet trade. Despite providing societal benefits, crayfish introductions are also known to cause adverse impacts in areas of introduction. A recent study evaluated the risk associated with 14 alien freshwater crayfish introductions in South Africa, most of which were classified as high risk due to their potential for major negative effects2. Eight crayfish species are listed on the NEM: BA A&IS Regulations and are presumed to be present in South Africa based on historical introduction3. However, uncertainty remains about the identity and occurrence of some species. Cherax cainii and C. tenuimanus were introduced for aquaculture, but it is uncertain if both species are present, and genetic verification is needed to confirm their presence. Similarly, Cherax destructor was also introduced for aquaculture, but its presence, in cultivation or in the wild, is unclear.\nEvidence indicates that Cherax quadricarinatus and Procambarus clarkii have established populations across several river systems. Containment has been proposed as the primary management strategy. Procambarus clarkii is not listed under the A&IS Regulations; it was previously listed as a prohibited species but was removed from the regulations in 2021, creating legal uncertainty that may have facilitated its spread. Anecdotal evidence suggests that five other crayfish species (Faxonius limosus, F. rusticus, Pontastacus leptodactylus, Pacifastacus leniusculus) listed under the A&IS Regulations are also present in South Africa, likely due to the pet trade- a significant invasion pathway that is difficult to manage. Several other crayfish species that have a global invasion history (Faxonius immunis, F. juvenilis, F. virilis, Procambarus acutus and P. virginalis) are not yet present in South Africa, highlighting a substantial invasion debt. Management options should prioritise preventing further introductions.\n\n\n\n\nRed-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkia), was a candidate for eradication in 2018, when it was first reported as part of the NBA 2018. However, in 2018 it was only known from the two localised sites in Mpumalanga and Free State, now it has been detected in the Western Cape province in 2025. (© Leon Barkhuizen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmphibians\nA total of 135 amphibian species occur in South Africa. These include a few recently described species; of these, 117 species are dependent on freshwater ecosystems for survival and successful reproduction. Twenty-one percent of the 117 taxa (25 taxa) are threatened with extinction, and an additional 9% (11 taxa) are ToCC (1 DD and 10 NT). Almost ~50% (63 taxa) of freshwater-dependent amphibians are endemic to South Africa, of which 36% (23 taxa) are threatened with extinction and 16% (10 taxa) are additional ToCC (Figure 1 and Table 1). The most important pressure driving species threat status for amphibians is the impacts of invasive alien species, including infectious diseases and invasive alien trees. Invasive alien trees impact water storage reservoirs and interrupt stream-flow consistency.\nAmphibians have shown a genuine change in Red List status between the assessment period 2017 to 2025 for only two species, and one of these is dependent on freshwater habitats (Figure 2). Phofung river frog (Amietia hymenopus) restricted to the high altitude areas of the Drakensberg in Lesotho and northern KwaZulu-Natal, has been uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable, due to deterioration in habitat quality, especially in Lesotho and areas bordering South Africa, where mines and proposed mines have had an observable increase in impact (both directly and indirectly) on this species. The species is also projected to be impacted by increased aridification across its range due to climate change, and overgrazing and water quality issues that have intensified since the last assessment. Recognized as a major global threat, climate change is increasingly driving amphibian declines in South Africa, affecting nearly half of threatened species, though its impacts remain hard to measure (Figure 3).\n\n\nMammals\nAt least 336 mammal species occur in South Africa, and their IUCN Red List status was assessed in 2025. At least 21 of the 336 taxa assessed make extensive use and are dependent on freshwater habitats. Of these 21 species, 33% (7 taxa) are threatened (i.e., CR, EN, or VU) and 19% (4 taxa) Near Threatened (Figure 1 and Table 1). Only eight species are endemic and four of these are Vulnerable. Since 2004, the RLI has declined sharply for freshwater mammals, with this downward trend continuing from 2015 into 2025. In contrast, terrestrial mammals have experienced a much slower rate of decline over the same period see terrestrial species summary. Of the 21 taxa dependent on freshwater systems, two species (Laminate Vlei Rat (Otomys laminatus (NT to VU) and the Cape shaggy rat (Dasymys capensis) (NT to VU)) have increased in their threat status, and this has largely been due to a reduction in wetland habitat, causing species population reduction (Figure 2). There has been no improvement in species status, as has been observed for other mammals in the terrestrial realm. This supports the call for more conservation efforts focused on restoring and maintaining river and wetland habitats.\n\n\nPlants\nAquatic (freshwater) plant species were not reassessed during the 2025 NBA, and only a small sample of 27 species is included in the freshwater summary statistics that have been extracted from the 900 representative sample of plant species for South Africa (Figure 1, Table 1). For a more detailed analysis of the status of freshwater plants, see NBA 2019 Freshwater techinal report4.\nInvasion of wetlands by alien invasive plants is the most important pressure to aquatic plants based on both the current analysis as well as the previous analysis using a 100-sample of aquatic plant species (Figure 4). Of the 27 plants classified as aquatic in the current assessment, 66% of ToCC are directly impacted due to competition for space and resources from invasive alien species.\n\n\n\n\nOxalis dines (VU), a species restricted to Cape vernal pools and other similar temporarily inundated habitats, provides an example of impacts in temporary systems, where ongoing habitat degradation due to crop cultivation and trampling by livestock continues, resulting in degradation of its habitat. It is also susceptible to severe drought conditions, and these events exacerbate the impacts of other pressures. (© Ismail Ebrahim)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragonflies and damselflies (Odonata)\nOdonata (dragonflies and damselflies) species are excellent indicators of freshwater habitat condition and serve as umbrella species for other aquatic macro-invertebrates5. There are 162 species known to occur in South Africa, with a fifth of these species endemic to the country (Figure 1 and Table 1). This group has been assessed multiple times globally and nationally and was included in the NBA for the first time in 2018 and the results presented are from that assessment4, as the group has not been updated since.\nMost of the Odonata species have been assessed as Least Concern (79%), as they have wide distribution ranges. They have also shown little change in their Red List status over the previous assessment period, as measured using the RLI (Figure 2). Some taxa are range restricted, and 33 taxa (20%) are ToCC (Figure 1 and Table 1). The main pressure faced by dragonflies is the shading out of their habitat (affecting 15 taxa) by invasive alien trees; they are also threatened by habitat modification due to livestock farming (affecting 14 taxa) and non-timber crop cultivation (affecting 11 taxa) (Figure 3). Some reprieve for the 15 taxa facing impact from invasive alien trees has come from highly effective invasive tree eradication programmes, with some remarkable success stories of re-colonization of habitats following the removal of these trees. Two species (Chlorocypha consueta and Crenigomphus cornutus) that were assessed as Critically Endangered Potentially Extinct (CRPE) in 2008 were re-assessed in 2017 as Regionally Extinct (RE). Despite extensive searches, these species have not been recorded since their initial discovery in South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. An update on the state of Odonata will be provided in the next assessment due in 2027.\n\n\nFreshwater crabs\nFreshwater crabs, represented by two genera in South Africa (Potamonuates (23 taxa) and Maritimonautes (1 species)) have been included in the NBA for the first time to improve representation of freshwater invertebrates. This group was first assessed in 2008 as part of the Regional Southern African Freshwater IUCN Red List assessment6. Since 2008, there has been a proliferation of species descriptions. This group now consists of 29 described species, including five newly recognized species that have been described since 20238. The most recent assessment was concluded in 2023 and included 24 freshwater crab species that were described pre-2023. Freshwater crabs, unlike other freshwater dependent groups, seem to be less impacted by modified systems, and based on the IUCN Red List assessments, only 3 of the 24 species are assessed as threatened (12% - are Vulnerable), and one species is assessed as Rare. These three species are highly restricted and recently described. It is suspected that they might have a wider distribution; however, based on current knowledge of their distributions, they have been listed as Vulnerable. Their habitats, mostly fragmented forests, are impacted by habitat disturbance and possibly loss due to impacts on the forest margin and trampling by livestock Potamonautes ntendekaensis (VU) , Potamonautes ngoyensis (VU), Potamonautes mhlophe (VU).\nFurther monitoring is needed to understand the impacts on these species, but it is suspected that they are experiencing some level of habitat disturbance that might cause declines. Apart from these species, most freshwater crabs have been assessed as Least Concern (83%, 20 species) and found to be highly resilient and have persisted in modified river systems and impacted wetlands. There is, however, no monitoring of this group, and long-term trends are not currently available. Monitoring is needed to confirm whether these species have high tolerance for changing and impacted habitats or whether there is a lack of detection of impacts. At present, freshwater crabs and Odonata are the only freshwater groups with low proportions of threatened species. Interestingly, both groups can utilise terrestrial systems if needed, likely increasing their tolerance to disturbances within the freshwater system.",

    "text": "Trends - the Red List Index\nThe trend in freshwater species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs)9. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in taxa assignments to Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, where the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are assessed as Extinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Red List Index (RLI) for freshwater species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, freshwater fishes, freshwater crabs, Anostraca (fairly shrimps), dragonflies and damselflies, and amphibians assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species are becoming more threatened over time. The steeper the slope, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taxonomic group at highest risk of extinction is the freshwater fishes. Steep declines were recorded between 2007 and 2016. While only due for reassessment in 2026, the declining status of rivers and dwindling resources available for management actions where many of these species are concentrated (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal) likely means that they will continue on a declining trajectory. Anostraca currently only has a single RLI point and it is below the national average, just second to freshwater fishes, and just below freshwater mammals. This indicates that this group has a high proportion of species that are assessed as threatened. Of the 20 freshwater-associated mammals that occur in South Africa, two have become more threatened since their last assessment in 2016. Amphibians and reptiles have had no changes in the status of species between the assessment period, possibly indicating some stabilisation; however, based on their recent assessments, many species are experiencing continued pressures, but not to the point of triggering an uplisting. Between the two assessment periods for Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), this group had four deteriorations in status – species becoming more threatened due to habitat loss and degradation, and two improvements due to effective invasive alien plant species control4. Due to improvements and deterioration of species threat status, the group’s RLI score is above the national average for freshwater species (Figure 2).\nAfter freshwater fishes, in the most recent assessment period, freshwater birds (water birds) have the steepest negative trend. Nineteen birds have been assessed at a higher threat status due to a genuine increase in their risk of extinction, and two species have been downlisted (wattled crane (Grus carunculata) and the southern bald ibis (Geronticus calvus). The major drivers for increased threat are linked to climate change, through prolonged drought and shifts in rainfall and temperatures (see box 4). While conservation efforts has resulted in improvements for these two species. Freshwater crabs have been assessed twice and are included here for the first time. This group has remained stable, due to their ability to persist in modified habitats. Freshwater plants are excluded from this trend analysis, as a sufficiently large representative sample is not currently available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Key pressures on South Africa’s threatened and Near Threatened freshwater species. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting these species, categorised by taxonomic group, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme10. The size of the bubbles indicates the percentage of taxa impacted by each pressure class. * Key pressures to plants are presented by a small sample of aquatic plants.",

    "text": "Protection Level\nThe 2018 NBA assessment4 found that most freshwater species, except freshwater fishes, were relatively well protected, while freshwater fishes were poorly protected. The current analysis shows the same pattern. Because freshwater systems are linear and many threats, such as pollution, invasive species, and water abstraction, originate upstream and outside protected areas, these pressures cannot be effectively mitigated within protected area boundaries. Protected areas are also mainly managed for terrestrial biodiversity, further limiting freshwater protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Protection level for South Africa’s indigenous freshwater taxonomic groups. Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa). Protection level for all taxa (A); protection level for South African endemics (B). *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the protection level is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater fish are the most Poorly Protected of South Africa’s freshwater taxonomic groups assessed. Only 26% of freshwater fish taxa included in the analysis were Well Protected (25 taxa), while the majority (74%, 71 taxa) of taxa are under protected (including Not Protected (17 taxa), Poorly Protected (33 taxa) or Moderately Protected (21 taxa)) (Figure 4). Seven freshwater fish are assessed as Critically Endangered and four of these taxa are assessed as Not Protected. These four are the Treur River Barb (Enteromius treurensis), Barrydale Redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli), Pseudobarbus senticeps and Galaxias sp nov ‘slender’, all with very restricted distributions, some limited to a single stretch of a river or a single sub-quaternary catchment. This finding has not changed since 2018 and these species remain highly threatened and not protected. Thirty-three taxa are listed as Poorly Protected, these occur across South Africa, with the majority of the taxa assessed as threatened or Near Threatened (25 taxa).\nOther taxonomic groups included in this analysis contrast strongly with freshwater fish, as the majority of species are Well Protected (Figure 4). However, when assessing under-protected species, these include 32 amphibians 18 birds, and 11 mammals. These under-protected species include a number of threatened and Near Threatened species for birds (4 taxa), amphibians (20 taxa), and mammals (7 taxa). Interestingly, all freshwater-dependent reptiles are assessed as Well Protected. Of the four birds assessed as under-protected, the white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi) (EN) was previously assessed as Not Protected (2017) and has now been assessed as Poorly Protected (2025)11. See White-winged flufftail project for further details.\nOf the eleven amphibian species assessed as Not Protected, nine are assessed as threatened. The Rough moss frog (Arthroleptella rugosa) (CR) and the Amatole toad (Vandijkophrynus amatolicus) (EN), remain Not Protected, since its initial assessment in 2017. Many newly described species, have been assessed as Not Protected, as their current known distribution does not overlap with protected areas (see the amphibian page for more details). In the case of mammals, four species are assessed as Poorly Protected. Interestingly, the spotted-necked otter (Hydrictis maculicollis – VU) and the Southern reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) (LC) have widespread distribution within South Africa, but with limited coverage within the protected area network. This reflects the terrestrial bias of the current protected area network, which was not designed to protect rivers. Protected area expansion needs to address this bias.\nRecent expansion of the protected area network has improved protection for some species, but many threatened freshwater species—especially freshwater fish—remain under-protected. Improving management within existing protected areas could greatly strengthen conservation outcomes. While protected areas help buffer species from land-use change, stronger management is often needed to meet conservation goals. For freshwater systems in particular, effective conservation requires protection and coordinated management at the whole catchment level, not just within individual protected areas. Further details will be provided in the technical report.",

    "text": "Conservation efforts\nThe Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4 is a critical commitment, requiring signatories to halt human-induced extinctions and improve species’ conservation status by 2030. Achieving this ambitious goal necessitates coordinated efforts among nations to effectively reverse species declines and maintain genetic diversity, particularly within populations of threatened species. South Africa contributes to Target 4, engaging with each taxonomic group and prioritising species for urgent recovery through comprehensive taxonomic Red List assessments. South Africa has initiated a process with each taxonomic group that has comprehensive Red List assessments for their taxonomic groups, to identify and prioritise species in urgent need of recovery to contribute to achieving the GBF Target 4 goals (see freshwater fish recovery efforts).\nAddressing and improving freshwater health will take considerable political will and resources. Many national, provincial, and local initiatives are currently active to improve the conservation of freshwater species, and species in general (see box on FBIS). Several key resources—including the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA), the DFFE Screening Tool, and the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS)(developed by the FRC) —guide decision-making and prevent impacts on freshwater species. The NFEPA is currently being updated into a national strategic spatial plan to integrate and strengthen planning across government and civil society.\nAddressing and improving freshwater health will take considerable political will and resources. Many national, provincial and local initiatives are currently active to improve the conservation of freshwater species, and species in general (See freshwater fish recovery page – add link). For conservation and prevention of future impacts, several tools have been developed and include the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) project and the DFFE Screening Tool, as well as the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS), developed and led by the Freshwater Research Center (see box on FBIS). These tools can be used to prevent impacts on species and guide decision-making. They are only some of the many other resources available to influence better decision-making for the protection of freshwater species. The NFEPA is currently being updated, and will be a strategic spatial plan to integrate and strengthen freshwater ecosystem and species-related planning and decision-making across government and civil society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. Rising to South Africa’s freshwater data challenge\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018 when the previous National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) was published, access to freshwater biodiversity data was limited, which made it difficult to undertake data-driven assessments of trends in the country’s freshwater species and ecosystems. In response to the difficulty in accessing high-quality, comprehensive freshwater biodiversity data, the Freshwater Research Centre (FRC) and partners, with funds from the JRS Biodiversity Foundation, initiated a project to develop the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS) – a data-rich, online platform for hosting and serving freshwater biodiversity data in South Africa. The purpose of the platform is to overcome barriers to data access by harmonising datasets from many different sources into one user-friendly, open access information system.\n\n\n\n\nThe Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS) map interface showing &gt;900,000 freshwater biodiversity records available for South Africa. (© FBIS)\n\n\n\nA new platform for freshwater biodiversity data in South Africa Launched in 2020, the FBIS serves as a platform for the inventory and maintenance of data, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-term change in freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem condition, and guiding future monitoring strategies and management decisions (read the paper). The FBIS complements and links with existing platforms like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the IUCN Red List, and provides users with a suite of powerful tools for visualising, analysing and downloading biodiversity (and associated abiotic) data. Because the platform conforms to international biodiversity data standards, including preserving detailed metadata for each record, it is now possible to access large, user-ready freshwater datasets at the click of a button.\n\n\n\n\nVisualising freshwater biodiversity data using spatial layers and querying a subset of the biodiversity data by selecting a custom polygon area (left), and a dashboard showing a breakdown of freshwater fish data from the selected polygon (right).(© FBIS)\n\n\n\nFrom data to impact\nAs of October 2025, the platform hosts over 900 000 biodiversity records for freshwater taxa within the groups Freshwater fish, Anurans, Invertebrates, Plants and Algae. The data come from various sources, such as existing data platforms like the GBIF, through to historical datasets, data from the peer-reviewed literature, and data from other field surveys and reports. For example, data generated through the recent REFRESH project will be accessible via the FBIS. There are 696 registered users on the platform who have collectively downloaded biodiversity data sets 3 572 times.\nThis improved data access is enabling new insights into species distributions, population changes over time and hotspots of endemism, richness, diversity and threat. The platform is built to support data-driven biodiversity assessments – including the NBA and applications from species Red List assessments to strategic protected area expansion. Data from the FBIS platform have already been used to assess the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving freshwater fish, to create freshwater fish sensitivity layers for the National Environmental Screening Tool, to update the PESEIS 2025 database, amongst others. Freshwater fish records collated through the FBIS have more than doubled the number of South African freshwater fish records on the GBIF.",

    "text": "Monitoring\nProtecting and managing freshwater habitat is vital for securing water resources and the many remaining undocumented or undescribed freshwater species. Although the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) showed clear fish decline, the true freshwater ecosystem and species crisis was likely underestimated due to insufficient data on freshwater-specific groups. The current assessment has improved this by including fairy shrimps (Anostraca) and freshwater crabs. Anostraca data now clearly reveals severe impacts in ephemeral habitats, contrasting with the relatively less threatened status of the more mobile freshwater crabs.\n• In the coming years, there will be a focus on including freshwater Mollusca to expand the freshwater-dependent taxa\n• Further, the proposed updating of NFEPA to include other freshwater taxonomic groups will ensure freshwater priority areas are identified that support critical species conservation.\n• The expansion and strengthening of the River Eco-status Monitoring Programme (REMP) is essential; this can be achieved through coordination and collaboration between all partners from the national government, provincial agencies, NGO’s and researchers. Due to a range of constraints, for example, funding limitations, the activities of the REMP have not been as efficient and effective as they could be.\n• Monitoring of freshwater species is undertaken at the provincial level, yet many conservation agencies have few remaining freshwater ecologists and technicians. In the 2018 inland aquatic NBA technical report (van Devender et al., 2018), a key message was that there was a noticeable decline in skilled staff and budget assigned to monitoring and interventions in freshwater systems. Observations and engagements with expert partners for this NBA suggest that this trend has continued, and there is a need to quantify the loss in capacity and to assess the drivers of this loss in capacity, to make sure that monitoring efforts are resumed to serve as early warnings and to inform planning and decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 6. Calling all citizen scientists who might have an interest in these freshwater creatures\n\n\n\n\n\nA range of freshwater related projects can be found on iNaturalist.

    "text": "Approach\n\nThreat Status Assessment\nSee the Red List explainer page for detailes about the assessment.\nIn the 2025 assessment of freshwater species, there has been a concerted effort to present a more balanced representation of freshwater species and to include more freshwater invertebrates. Nine freshwater groups are included in this assessment, including, for the first time, Freshwater crabs and Anostraca species. This addresses a gap identified in the previous NBA12, where only Odonata represented freshwater invertebrates.\nNoting, that freshwater plants, only a small sample is presented (27 from a 900-representative sample of all plants). A more comprehensive assessment of aquatic plants has been identified as a priority to be able to accurately report on their threat status in South Africa. Further,\nAssessment limitation and improvements needed Freshwater species: The current list of freshwater fishes excludes migratory fishes such as the eel species present in South African freshwater and marine realms, thus representing a knowledge gap. Further work is required to enable comprehensive reporting on the state of migratory fish species.\n\n\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a persistence target for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends on the area protected and on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assessment was applied to 268 mammal species with the persistence targets set either at the area required to protect 10 000 individuals or at a minimum viable population with standardised MVP estimates obtained from meta-analyses undertaken by Hilbers et al. (2017).\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas – quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target is within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness – adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines (such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes, etc.) are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major pressures;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major pressures on species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major pressures on the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.",

    "text": "South Africa’s unique terrestrial biodiversity is globally recognised, with high species diversity and exceptional levels of endemism (especially for plants). The wide climatic range and varied geology and topography result in an equally diverse set of 463 terrestrial ecosystem types. This natural heritage supports vibrant rural and urban land uses and provides essential ecosystem services. The steady loss of terrestrial habitat and decline in species populations due to various human activities, set against a backdrop of accelerating climate change, paints an overall picture of decline in the biodiversity and ecosystem services on which we rely. Gains in protection of species and ecosystems (through biodiversity stewardship programs) and growing sustainable use and restoration efforts are a positive trend. Biodiversity inclusive spatial planning, a well-established practice in South Africa, is a key tool in striking the balance between development and biodiversity.\nThirty percent of South Africa’s terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as threatened, this translates to 11% of the remaining natural habitat. There has been an overall increase in the risk of collapse of terrestrial ecosystems since 2014. While a quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types are Well Protected, the same percentage are Not Protected. The overall trend for protection is positive, with a steady increase in the Protected Areas network - primarily due to biodiversity stewardship programs. The full results can be found on the ecosystem threat status page and ecosystem protection level page.\nA total of 24 678 terrestrial taxa have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria. Of these, 14% are threatened, while in 2018, 13% of 22 667 assessed taxa were threatened. The only new taxonomic group included is the Spiders (2214 taxa) that have very low levels of threat (4%), so the overall increase in the proportion of species threatened is an indication of many species in other taxonomic groups becoming more threatened. Species Protection Levels are increasing, but greater gains could be made through more effective management of protected areas. An overview of species threat status and protection level in the terrestrial realm can be found on the terrestrial species page. Detailed findings, arranged by taxonomic group can be found in the species findings section.\nThe state of biodiversity is shaped by both current and historical pressures. Croplands cover a very large portion of the terrestrial realm (&gt;16%), but there has been limited expansion into natural areas in recent times. In contrast, the expansion of settlements and mining are relevant both historically and currently. Certain activities, such as targeted poaching of succulent plant species and renewable energy installations represent new pressures on biodiversity. Climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity are increasingly prominent, with studies more clearly attributing species declines and landscape changes to temperature and rainfall regime change. A summary of the main pressures in the terrestrial realm can be found on the pressures page.\nPriority actions across all realms are summarised on the priority actions page, and discussed in key messages A2, A4, A6, B1, B3, B4, B5.",

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status results\nEcosystem threat status is a headline indicator established to assess how close ecosystem types are to collapsing (losing vital aspects of their structure, function, or composition). For the NBA 2025 (as for the NBA2018) the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework was applied systematically across all terrestrial ecosystem types. Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more about this indicator on the about ecosystem threat status page.\nNearly one-third (141/463) of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems, representing 11% of the remaining natural habitat of South Africa, are threatened. Among these 63 are listed as Critically Endangered, 68 as Endangered, and 10 as Vulnerable (Table 1). Many of these ecosystems are concentrated in the key economic hubs, particularly in the south-western, north-eastern, and north-western regions of the country, where anthropogenic land-use activities and associated degradation pressures are major drivers of ecosystem change. Many of these threatened ecosystems have naturally restricted distributions, and accelerated habitat loss over the past three decades in these regions has compounded their vulnerability to collapse (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Changes to the National Vegetation Map\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, the National Vegetation Map has been refined, increasing the number of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems from 456 to 463. These boundary adjustments and the addition of new types have influenced both the potential/historical extent of some ecosystems and their threat status categorisation. Refer to National Vegetation Map Project for more details on these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Summary of the assessment outcomes; including the number of ecosystem types per category and proportion of the natural areas remaining per category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory (IUCN RLE)\nNumber of ecosystems\nPercentage of threatened ecosystem types\nNatural extent remaining within South Africa in 2022 (km²)\nPercentage of the remaining natural extent\nPercentage of total terrestrial landmass extent\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered\n63\n13.6%\n9175.151\n0.9%\n0.7%\n\n\nEndangered\n68\n14.7%\n70047.437\n7.1%\n5.5%\n\n\nVulnerable\n10\n2.2%\n30431.996\n3.1%\n2.4%\n\n\nLeast Concern\n322\n69.5%\n871290.432\n88.8%\n68.9%\n\n\nTotal\n463\n100%\n980945.016\n100%\n77.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, the main pressures on terrestrial ecosystems include habitat loss due to croplands, human settlements and plantation forestry. Since 1990, croplands and plantations have not expanded significantly but human settlements continue to expand; these pressures are key factors in the Red List of Ecosystem assessments. Pressures such as invasive alien plants and rangeland overstocking are also important, degrading ecosystem processes and functions. New data on the distribution of invasive alien plants1–5 over large portions of South Africa has contributed to improved assessments, especially of Fynbos and Grassland ecosystem types (key message A4). However, there is still no comprehensive, spatially explicit dataset on land degradation for the country, which limits the ability to fully assess and track these impacts. For more about pressures in the terrestrial realm refer to the pressures page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map (A) shows the historical extent of terrestrial threatened ecosystem types in South Africa, with the inset graph indicating the number of ecosystem types in each Red List of Ecosystems category. Map (B) Shows the remaining natural extent (circa 2022) of threatened terrestrial ecosystems; white areas represent non-natural areas such as croplands, built-up areas, mines, dams and tree plantations. The inset graph in (B) shows the percentage of the total remaining natural habitat (980,945 km²) within each category\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome level results\nA pattern first highlighted in the 2018 RLE assessment6 remains evident: threat levels vary widely across South Africa’s biomes. Fynbos and Grassland are most affected by human-driven and degrading pressures. In Fynbos, 40 ecosystems are Critically Endangered and 27 Endangered, together accounting for 53% of its 126 types. Grassland has 24 (33%) threatened ecosystems, encompassing four Critically Endangered, 14 Endangered, and six Vulnerable. These threatened ecosystems cover about 25% of the remaining natural extent in Fynbos and 28% in Grassland. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt is the most threatened biome, with all its ecosystem types listed as threatened. Other biomes face moderate risk, including Albany Thicket (nine threatened ecosystems, 20% of remaining extent) and Savanna (19, 7%). The Nama-Karoo is the least threatened, reflecting relatively lower pressure on its ecosystems (Table 2, Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

RLE assessments in the terrestrial realm will improve over time as data on ecosystem condition within forests and rangelands (including much of the Grassland, Savanna, Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo and Desert biomes) are gathered, validated and incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Threatened ecosystems per biome, showing (A) the percentage of ecosystem types per biome that fall within each threat category, and (B) the percentage of the total natural habitat remaining in each biome that falls within each threat category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvincial level results\nSimilarly, threat levels also vary considerably across the nine provinces of South Africa. Gauteng, the country’s economic hub, has the highest share of threatened habitat by extent (52%), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (39%) and Mpumalanga (34%). In the Western Cape, Limpopo and North West, approximately 15% of the remaining habitat is categorised as threatened, though there are many more threatened ecosystem types in the Western Cape, a product of the extremely high landscape and plant diversity. In contrast the Northern Cape, with its vast arid landscapes has only 11 threatened ecosystems (covering less than 1% of the remaining natural habitat), making it the least threatened province in the country, however, rapidly expanding mining footprints on the coast and interior combined with landscape level changes in plant community composition (linked to a combination of rangeland management, drought, climate change), are cause for concern (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

    "text": "Red List Index of Ecosystems\nThe Red List Index of Ecosystems (RLIe) tracks changes in ecosystem threat status over time7,8. The methods focus the indicator on genuine changes in status by accounting for the impact of improved data at later time points. RLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear, comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. RLIe was calculated for 463 terrestrial ecosystems at the biome level, across four RLE assessment periods: 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2024. The emerging trends reveal a complex picture of both resilience and vulnerability across South Africa’s biomes.\nThe Indian Ocean Coastal Belt has experienced the steepest decline and has the lowest overall RLIe, falling from 0.50 in 2014 to 0.43 in 2024. All ecosystem types in this biome are threatened and over time they are moving into higher risk categories. This steep downward trend reflects growing pressures from land-use conversion, including the expansion of croplands, urban development, and plantations. The Fynbos Biome, renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, faced substantial historical pressures resulting in low RLIe scores (0.62) but these are reasonably stable since 2018 suggesting that the main drivers of change, particularly agricultural pressure in lowland areas, have been entrenched for many years. In the Desert, Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes there are fewer threatened ecosystems and hence slightly higher RLIe (~0.8) but these scores have dropped substantially since 2014, suggesting accelerating pressures.\nAt the national level, South Africa’s overall RLIe declined slightly from 0.82 to 0.79 between 2014 and 2024, signaling a slow but steady increase in ecosystem threat. The divergent trajectories seen across individual biomes highlight the importance of targeted, biome-specific conservation efforts to address the primary drivers of change shaping ecosystem threat status across the country.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Biomes of South Africa.\nThe moist, winter-rainfall region in the southwest of the country is home to the unique Fynbos biome. Adjacent to this lies the Succulent Karoo biome, an arid winter-rainfall biome with the highest diversity of succulent plants in the world. The Nama-Karoo biome covers the arid, summer-rainfall, central interior of the country. The Savanna biome dominates the northern and eastern summer rainfall regions of South Africa, and is the largest biome in Africa. The Grassland biome occurs mostly on the cooler high-lying central plateau and has high levels of plant endemism. The Albany Thicket biome occurs in the eastern and southern Cape and contains a unique combination of plant forms with an Eocene origin and unique evolutionary history4. The Forest biome is characterised by small patches distributed across the winter and summer rainfall areas of the country. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biome represents the southernmost extent of the moist tropical seaboard of East Africa. The Desert biome occupies a small portion of the extreme northwest of the country, forming the southernmost extent of the Namib Desert.\nThe vegetation map reflects the historical extent of the vegetation prior to major anthropogenic land conversion (ca. 1750). By estimating and mapping the extent and state of our natural ecosystems before large-scale human modifications we establish a baseline against which the state and extent of ecosystems can be monitored. In South Africa we have a wealth of information that allows for the approximation of historical extent5,6. The arid and mountainous character of much of South Africa also means that many landscapes have not seen extensive habitat loss - making estimation of historical extent feasible.",

    "section": "Seven broad themes for action",
    "text": "Seven broad themes for action\nThe fifteen key messages of NBA 2025 highlight a range of actions that can be summarised into seven broad themes:\n\nBiodiversity inclusive spatial planning (key messages A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, B4): Biodiversity and ecological infrastructure are powerful socio-economic engines contributing to South Africa’s development. The negative impacts on biodiversity, both direct (e.g., land clearing, built infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., pollution, changes to natural processes), from land and sea use change can be avoided or minimised through effective biodiversity inclusive spatial planning. South Africa has well-established provincial spatial biodiversity planning and prioritisation processes, plus screening tools for biodiversity sensitivity in development sites (Figure 1). Ongoing investment is needed to keep these plans and tools current with the latest biodiversity data, and ensure they inform decision-making at national, provincial and local levels. Marine Spatial Planning processes offer robust opportunities for biodiversity plans to influence use in the marine realm and along the coast. Biodiversity inclusive spatial plans can also guide ecosystem restoration and expansion of protected and conserved areas.\nPolicy development or refinement (key messages A3, A4, A7, B2, B4, C1): National, provincial and local policies and regulations unlock biodiversity and ecological infrastructure’s benefits to people. NBA 2025 identifies key sectors needing effective policies (providing required frameworks, incentives and governances structures) to address pressures on biodiversity. For example, policy gaps around pollution, freshwater flow requirements to marine environments and management of invasive species introduction pathways can be addressed through cross-sectoral approaches that strengthen interconnectivity between people and biodiversity. Closing these gaps requires strengthening collaboration between all levels of governments, particularly to local government where targeted capacity building and technical support is needed to help municipalities integrate biodiversity conservation and sustainable use responsibilities into their policies and operations.\nEnforcement and compliance (key messages A3, A7, B2, B5, C1, C3): Although South Africa has strong environmental policies, effective enforcement and compliance mechanisms are required to achieve biodiversity conservation outcomes. Compliance and enforcement reporting should be strengthened as this provides both impetus for implementation and means of monitoring progress towards targets. Limited capacity and budgets for compliance and enforcement are major challenges, and effective cooperation and innovative solutions are needed to transform the relationship between people and nature, address the underlying causes of non-compliance and enable adaptive management.\nManagement plans and programme/project implementation (key messages A1, A5, A7, B1, B2, B4, B5, C2, C3): Co-produced local management plans and projects/programmes are key tools for ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity, protecting livelihoods, and restoring nature’s contributions to people. Scientifically-sound project/programme design and robust project management are essential for cost-effective, successful implementation with lasting positive impact.\nInnovation, access to and transfer of technology (key messages A4, A6, C2, C3): Innovation is required to address pressures on biodiversity and persistent compliance and implementation challenges. For example, new approaches for legal wildlife trade may deliver better results than decades of enforcement efforts that have had limited success. Crucial investments include artificial intelligence and new technologies for remote sensing, data science and forensics, alongside fostering innovations in citizen science and stewardship of biodiversity. Building partnerships that facilitate exchange of skills, knowledge and best practice is key.\nData collection and monitoring (key messages A1, A3, A4, A5, B3, B5, C2): Effective biodiversity monitoring depends on continuous long-term data collection and analysis. Without this foundation, biodiversity inclusive spatial planning and biodiversity assessments are compromised. Interventions to mitigate pressures on biodiversity must be planned using the best possible data to ensure return on investment. Measuring impact through targeted data collection and monitoring enables adaptive management of current projects, informs future project improvements, supports meaningful reporting, and contributes to national datasets.\nInnovative financing and resource mobilisation (key message C3): Current financial flows are insufficient for South Africa’s ambitious biodiversity targets. It is essential to ensure that the baseline funding for biodiversity is not eroded while exploring new sources. There is urgent need for coordinated action to scale up innovative public and private financing mechanisms. Blended finance models, biodiversity offsets, green bonds, and other nature-positive finance solutions can help bridge this funding gap, while partnerships with the private sector and development finance institutions can unlock considerable additional capital. Strategic resource allocation and measurable outcomes depend on investment in robust financial tracking systems, natural capital accounting, and transparent reporting.",

    "text": "Reflecting on twenty years since the first NBA\nThese seven themes have remained consistent across all iterations of the NBA, although each has been substantially refined and expanded over the years. Global and national approaches to biodiversity conservation and management have seen important, nuanced changes. For example, the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004 called for expanding the formal (i.e., state-owned) protected area network, but today’s approach recognises that very effective conservation also happens outside formal reserves through private landowner initiatives (e.g., biodiversity stewardship programmes) and community-led other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). The often repeated calls for better regulations and enforcement for certain pressures are now augmented by innovative technologies (e.g., satellite monitoring, AI-powered wildlife tracking), and the move towards a whole-of-society custodianship approach to nature. Similarly, the perennial challenge of inadequate funding has led to numerous diverse and innovative finance mechanisms for biodiversity and  greater focus on economic systems to benefit both nature and people. The NBA has grown in content and participation, and its messaging reflects how conservation thinking and practice has developed.\n\n\n\nIt has been 20 years since the release of the first NBA and the calls for action in NSBA 2004, NBA 2011 and NBA 2018 are all still relevant. The various intervention plans that are co-produced or updated after NBA 2025’s release, in participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, could reflect the past calls to action, while using the modern nuances of biodiversity conservation and nature’s contributions to people.",

    "text": "The framing of action, response and intervention plans\nThe NBA 2025 presents a suite of findings that can inform diverse international, national and local biodiversity initiatives, providing context, indicators and avenues for intervention.\nAt the global level, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets 23 urgent targets for 2030 and four outcome-oriented goals for 2050. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration focuses on interventions to reverse biodiversity loss. The various assessments by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) guide global thinking on biodiversity trends and solutions (e.g., the IPBES Transformative Change Assessment emphasises that transformative change requires a redefined relationship between people and nature). The NBA provides national context and important trends in biodiversity for these processes, and contributes many indicators specifically needed to report on South Africa’s international commitments.\nNational initiatives include South Africa’s National Development Plan 2030, and SANParks’ ‘Vision 2040’ that reimagines the role of conservation as a catalyst of redress, economic advancement and job creation through the Mega Living Landscapes. Furthermore, South Africa’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is being updated around four strategic dimensions: i) conservation (including formal protection, stewardship, OECMs, and targeted species efforts); ii) enhancing nature’s contributions to people (including inclusivity in the biodiversity economy); iii) mainstreaming biodiversity (across all sectors and levels of government and society); and iv) resource mobilisation (innovative, sustainable, and diversified strategies).\nThere are also many local, district and provincial-level initiatives under which actions, responses and interventions can be framed. South Africa has limited resources to implement these plans, and must capitalise on past successes, existing initiatives and strategic innovation to meet national targets for both biodiversity and development. The NBA can guide these initiatives and provide a wealth of data products to support decision-making.",

Of the 20 coastal invertebrates assessed (the first sandy beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species globally), four (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further three (15%) are Near Threatened.

The terrestrial assessments also include many Data Deficient taxa since many genera of plants and invertebrates still require taxonomic work and are not yet sufficiently well delineated for a threat status to be assigned. For the freshwater and terrestrial realms, complete taxonomic groups have been assessed, providing greater confidence in the results.

    "text": "Species protection level\nSpecies protection level measures the contribution of the national protected area network to species persistence. The indicator considers two factors - the contribution of a protected area to meeting a population target, as well as the effectiveness of the protected area in mitigating pressures on species. Species are categorised in four categories, depending on the percentage of their conservation target met.\nThis indicator has been used to assess terrestrial and freshwater species within six taxonomic groups (Figure 3). Plants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 taxa. Peripheral taxa, which have less than 5% of their distribution range occurring in South Africa, were excluded from the analysis. Protection level has been calculated for 2 449 taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Protection level for six South Africa’s indigenous terrestrial and freshwater taxonomic groups. Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa). Protection level for all taxa (A); protection level for South African endemics (B). *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the protection level is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nExcept for freshwater fishes, South Africa’s protected area network protects species relatively well, with more than 50% of taxa assessed as Well Protected in most groups (Figure 3 A). The protection level of birds and reptiles is particularly good, with more than 85% of taxa in both groups being Well Protected.\nProtection levels of endemic species are generally lower (Figure 3 B), with freshwater fishes and amphibians having the highest proportion of endemic species that are Not Protected, 36% and 19% respectively. Endemic mammals are of some concern as 20 taxa (34%) are Poorly Protected and four taxa (7%) are Not Protected.\nThe effectiveness of protected areas in mitigating pressures on species reveals some interesting case studies. When protected areas are not effective, it can result in species falling to a lower protection level category than an assessment based solely on the population protected. While 38% of freshwater fishes are well represented within protected areas, many species are not being effectively protected due to the presence of invasive alien fish species within the protected areas’ freshwater systems and limited management interventions in place to control these invasive species. Pollution and over-abstraction of water upstream of the protected area boundary further compromise protection effectiveness. Consequently, only 23% of South African freshwater fish species qualify as Well Protected once the impact of these pressures is taken into consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaubenya namaquensis, a rare and restricted range species from Namaqualand, experienced a genuine improvement in protection level status as a result of the declaration of new protected areas between 2018 and 2025. (© Nick Helme)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critically Endangered Cape Flats frog (Microbatrachella capensis) (© Kurt van Wyk) improved in protection level due to rehabilitation of wetland habitats within the Table Mountain National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty-five birds (8.3%) are placed in lower protection level categories after effectiveness is included. The effectiveness adjustment reduces the protection level score particularly for wetland species (e.g., flamingos, cranes, pelicans) and raptors (e.g., vultures, harriers).\nAmphibians and plants are also significantly impacted by pressures within protected areas, resulting in 7% of both amphibians and plants assessed in lower protection level categories. While amphibians are impacted by high levels of invasive alien species within protected areas, the main reason for failures in plant protection effectiveness is the high levels of plant poaching in the protected areas of Namaqualand.\nEighteen mammals (7%) are assessed in lower protection level categories due to poaching and bushmeat hunting within protected areas.\nThe Species Protection Level indicator has recently been adapted into the Species Protection Index, following the principles of the IUCN Red List Index of species. The index tracks changes in species protection level over time and is used for national and international biodiversity reporting.\nMany species have improved in their protection level since the last assessment in 2018. A total of 5% of plant species assessed have improved in protection level with the newly proclaimed Mountain Zebra-Camdeboo Protected Environment, Gamsberg Nature Reserve, and Orange River Mouth Nature Reserve. Nine bird species (1%), four amphibian species (3%), nine freshwater fish species (9%), eight (3%) mammal taxa and seven (2%) reptile species have shown improvements in protection level. The improved protection level for reptiles is specifically due to the newly proclaimed De Hoop Dam and Mphaphuli Protected Environments and the Thengwe Nature Reserve, all in Limpopo.",

    "text": "Intersecting threat status and protection level\nWhile overall protection of species has improved, threatened species remain inadequately protected. Less than 30% of threatened amphibian, mammal and plant species, and only 5% of threatened freshwater fishes are Well Protected. On a positive note, nearly 60% of threatened bird and reptile species are Well Protected.\nSome species have benefited from the expansion of protected areas and targeted management interventions, however these successes are limited and most threatened species remain under protected. For example, the Endangered freshwater fish species the Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseudobarbus verloreni) has shifted from Not Protected to Poorly Protected following the declaration of a new protected area that now covers one of its populations. Unfortunately the broader pattern for freshwater fishes is that protected areas do little to shield species from ongoing pressures of invasive species, over-abstraction of water and pollution.\nSpecies threat status and protection level assessments provide a useful basis for guiding prioritisation processes. Highly threatened (Critically Endangered and Endangered) and under protected (Not Protected and Poorly Protected) species represent the most urgent need for conservation action, particularly when they are endemic to South Africa. Across all taxon groups 5% of taxa (127/2 449) fall into this category, and the majority of these are South African endemics (80%, 104/127 taxa). Freshwater fishes and amphibians have the highest proportion of species in this category, 27% (26/96 assessed fishes) and 13% (17/133 assessed amphibians), respectively. Both groups make use of freshwater habitats, which are also typically threatened ecosystems. Five per cent of plant species and close to 10% of all assessed mammal species are both highly threatened and under protected. Birds and reptiles have fewer species (less than 2%) within this category, and these species include habitat specialists and range-restricted species that require specific targeted protected area expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi) is Critically Endangered due to the high rate of loss and degradation of its preferred habitat, seasonal marshland, however, its Protection Level has improved from Not Protected to Poorly Protected, through concerted expansion of protected areas in Mpumalanga and southern KwaZulu-Natal.

    "text": "South Africa’s Species Protection Level (SPL) indicator was developed to complement the Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) indicator, which has been part of the NBA headline indicators since 20041. Species protection level was assessed for the first time in 20182.\nThe SPL indicator measures the contribution of the protected area network to species persistence. The indicator considers two factors - the contribution of a protected area to meeting a population target, as well as the effectiveness of the protected area in mitigating pressures on the species. This factor is included because studies of the contributions of protected areas to species conservation consistently note that effective protected area management is as important for species persistence as increasing habitat protection3–6. Where protected areas are less than 100% effective in mitigating pressures, a penalty factor is applied to the protected area’s contribution to the species target.\nA protection score is calculated for each species, which is the summed scores for individual protected areas where they are confirmed present, and the protection score is compared to the population target and expressed as a percentage of the target met.

However, to track changes in species protection level over time, protection level categories applied to species are combined into a single score, the Species Protection Index (SPI) with a value ranging between 0 and 1. An index value of 1 indicates all species are Well Protected, while the score is 0 when all species are Not Protected.",

Protected areas in South Africa are areas declared under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003)8. The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment maintains a national register of areas recognised by the Act, and this database, known as the South African Protected Areas Database (SAPAD), informs the protection level assessments for species and ecosystems.\nFor each protection level assessment, a spatial layer is prepared representing the extent of the national protected area network at that point in time. Protected areas that have been deproclaimed are excluded. Protected areas are grouped into clusters - which represent groups of adjacent protected areas. Species are considered present in a protected area when there is suitable habitat for the species in the protected area, and the species has been recorded present anywhere within the protected area’s larger cluster.\n\n\nProtected area effectiveness\nInformation on the effectiveness of protected areas in mitigating pressures on species is provided by protected area management effectiveness experts from South African conservation agencies. This information is augmented by national data on the distribution of alien invasive plants within protected areas9, as well as changes in the extent of natural or near-natural areas inside protected areas10.\nProtected area effectiveness is rated in three categories and a penalty factor is applied to the protected area’s contribution to a species’ conservation target where it is not 100% effective in mitigating pressures (Table 2). The effect of the penalty factors is that much larger populations of a species need to be in protected areas to meet the species’ target, as a means to offset ongoing declines inside protected areas.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

This approach is preferred over area-based targets because population size is most closely correlated with persistence11,12, while area of habitat and population size are less well correlated due to large variability in species density13. Individual taxonomic groups use various methods for setting population targets, to accommodate different levels of data availability, as well as the population dynamics and life-history patterns of different species. The methods used to set conservation targets are documented in technical reports referenced on species’ taxon pages.",

Category weights are then combined into an index score similar to the calculation of the Red List Index7. The index is calculated for individual time points in an assessment, to provide a time series indicating trends in species protection over time.\nThe formula for calculating the SPI for a time point t is as follows:\n\\[\nSPI_t = 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_s W_{c(t,s)}}{W_{NP} \\cdot N}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nWc(t,s) is the weight for protection category c at time t for species s\nWNP is the weight for the Not Protected category\nN is the number of species assessed\n\nThis formula returns a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means all species are Not Protected and 1 means all species are Well Protected. The index value changes when species protection is improved or deteriorates enough to cross a protection level category threshold. Improvements can be achieved either through protected area expansion, or improvements in protected area effectiveness. However, improving protection for species that are already Well Protected makes no difference to the index. The index value decreases when protected areas are deproclaimed or when protected area effectiveness decline.",

This indicator provides a systematic mechanism for tracking progress towards achieving Goal A of the GBF, which focuses on maintaining and enhancing ecosystem integrity.\nConceptually, the RLIe mirrors and complements the Red List Index8 (of species), offering comparable insights into ecosystem-level risk. It tracks changes in the threat status of ecosystems over time9,10, with all trend assessments derived directly from the outcomes of IUCN RLE assessments. This indicator reflects genuine changes in ecosystem status, accounting for improvements in data and understanding across assessment periods. Broadly speaking, the RLIe represents the mean of ordinal ranks assigned to each risk category and is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\nRLIE_t = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} W_{C_{i,t}}}{W_{C_O} \\cdot n}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(W_{C_{i,t}}\\) represents the risk category rank for ecosystem \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\).\n\\(W_{C_O}\\) is the maximum category rank (Collapsed = 5).\n\\(n\\) is the total number of ecosystems, excluding Data-Deficient and/or Not Evaluated ecosystems.\n\nRisk category ranks:\n\nCollapsed = 5\nCritically Endangered = 4\nEndangered = 3\nVulnerable = 2\nNear Threatened = 1\nLeast Concern = 0\n\nRLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear and comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. The indicator is designed for flexible application, allowing trends to be assessed for overall risk categories, or by individual criteria to reveal key drivers of ecosystem change. In addition, the RLIe can be disaggregated by South African biome for national reporting, or ecosystem functional group, aligning with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology10,11 for global reporting.",

    "text": "A sufficiently resourced biodiversity sector is crucial to managing biodiversity for all. Resource constraints compromise the ability to understand, track and address the impacts of biodiversity loss and degradation on people and nature. To protect the country’s natural heritage for future generations, South Africa must move beyond business-as-usual and mobilise private sector investment and innovative finance solutions to fund biodiversity.\n\nDespite gradual increases in nominal public sector spending, South Africa’s Biodiversity Expenditure Review highlights a concerning trend that real expenditure (adjusted for inflation) is declining, eroding the purchasing power of existing resources. This fiscal pressure, compounded by South Africa’s constrained macroeconomic environment, poses serious challenges to achieving the country’s biodiversity targets under the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). \n\n\n\nManaging South Africa’s biodiversity is a collective effort that requires collaboration and resources, and moving beyond business-as-usual to diversified and innovative finance solutions. (© Jeremy Shelton)\n\n\nTo address this, the Biodiversity Expenditure Review strongly advocates for diversifying finance flows, including expanding private sector engagement, unlocking green finance instruments such as biodiversity bonds, and fostering public-private partnerships. Private sector partners, particularly financial institutions, have a key role to play in mobilising resources and innovative finance solutions to support more positive outcomes for biodiversity. Funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund offer opportunities to scale up efforts for biodiversity and climate, and complement traditional funding mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and others.  \nThe move towards a more collaborative, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach is key to building an effective resource base for the biodiversity sector and to support positive biodiversity outcomes. This is underpinned by building strong partnerships, exploring new opportunities, strengthening institutions, and building capacity and skills. The Biodiversity Finance Plan for the third NBSAP will provide a clear, evidence-based roadmap to mobilise and align financial resources. Importantly, the country needs to standardise biodiversity tagging across all sectors to improve the tracking and reporting of biodiversity-related expenditures. This is the foundation of a sustainable biodiversity finance framework for South Africa, one that safeguards the country’s exceptional natural heritage, supports socio-economic development, and ensures long-term investment.",

    "text": "Biodiversity patterns and ecological processes are connected in complex ways that cross realms and human-constructed boundaries. Human activities in different sectors, each with separate policies and practices, can impact on the same biodiversity and ecological infrastructure in different ways. Coordinated and collaborative planning and decision-making is essential to account for this interconnectedness.\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives, and safeguarding biodiversity calls for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.\n\n\nBiodiversity provides benefits and essential services to people, like food, clean water and medicines, and enriches our cultural, spiritual and recreational practices. These services are dependent on intact ecosystems, healthy species populations and genetic diversity. The interconnectedness of biodiversity and human wellbeing is highlighted globally through the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity: conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of the components of biodiversity, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation. In South Africa, this interconnectivity is featured in the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity, which provides a vision for an inclusive, transformed society where biodiversity conservation and sustainable use ensure healthy ecosystems and equitable benefit-sharing for present and future generations.\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives of inclusive economic growth, job creation, and improved service delivery and wellbeing for all citizens. The National Development Plan calls for collective responsibility towards the biodiversity that underpins these national goals. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) can provide an opportunity for all actors in the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to work together and contribute to these national goals by strengthening the conservation of biodiversity; promoting and expanding the benefits derived from biodiversity; embedding biodiversity considerations across all sectors and levels of government and society; and strengthening financial and technical support for effective implementation.\nSouth Africa’s policy and legislative framework includes several tools to facilitate cross-sectoral planning and decision-making. Tools like Spatial Development Frameworks (developed at local, provincial and national level) and Marine Spatial Planning require multi-sectoral approaches to balance competing needs. Implementation of these frameworks, while sometimes challenging, can be improved by developing partnerships and working collaboratively. Some institutional arrangements already support this approach, for example, the Inland Water Ecosystem Liaison Committee, convened by the Department of Water and Sanitation, brings together all organs of state with shared mandates for managing and conserving rivers and wetlands. At the subnational level, catchment partnerships are an example of bringing together stakeholders from across government, civil society, research and the private sector to address natural resource challenges in a way that supports social and economic development. Collaborative action across government, all sectors and society towards a more nature positive and inclusive pathway will enable interconnectedness, resulting in thriving ecosystems, species and genetic diversity driving economic growth and wellbeing for all.",

    "text": "South Africa has made progress towards expanding protected areas to be more ecologically representative of ecosystems and species (well established). Spatial biodiversity planning tools continue to guide strategic expansion efforts. By enabling better participation in conservation and restoration, addressing gaps in sustainable finance and enhancing effectiveness of protected and conserved areas, pressures on ecosystems and species can be further mitigated.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas, to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Areas such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape) (© Kerry Sink), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation and recognition as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in partnership with value holders.\n\n\nExpanding the ecological representation of ecosystems and species in protected and conserved areas strengthens their effectiveness in reducing pressures on biodiversity. South Africa has made progress in expanding protected and conserved areas, with spatial planning guiding the inclusion of diverse terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems and their species. For example, the marine protected area network is spatially efficient and represents 83% of marine ecosystem types across 5.4% of South Africa’s ocean. Despite these advances, gaps remain in achieving fully representative coverage, particularly for estuarine and freshwater ecosystem types. Restoration initiatives, including controlling invasive species, could also increase effectiveness of these areas in protecting ecosystems and species. However, resources and capacity for management have not increased alongside the expansion of protected and conserved areas. \nProtected and conserved areas provide multiple benefits, including supporting sustainable jobs in tourism and the biodiversity economy, enhancing cultural and recreational experiences, and contributing to climate resilience and human wellbeing. Effective management of existing protected and conserved areas will ensure that progress made in expansion of these areas continues to deliver these benefits. Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework calls for the conservation of 30% of land, waters and seas by 2030 at the global level, with attention to effectiveness, ecological representativity and equitable governance systems. South Africa, with innovative resourcing strategies (see key message C3), is committed to all elements of the target. \nProtected and conserved areas work well with community involvement. Diversified protection models and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), can provide new opportunities for community-led conservation, livelihood diversification and cultural heritage protection. Initiatives that provide opportunities for communities living in and around protected and conserved areas to become active participants should be enhanced and encouraged. Combining aspects of both natural and cultural heritage in protected area expansion can foster the involvement of indigenous and local communities. Inclusive and participatory stakeholder processes are needed for more effective protected areas that support thriving people and nature. The biodiversity sector must strengthen capacity for social processes across institutions to create innovative partnerships with community and industry. Securing sustainable finance, enhancing institutional capacity, and fostering innovative partnerships with communities and industry are essential to ensuring that protected and conserved areas continue to deliver long-term ecological, social and economic benefits.",

Achieving biodiversity conservation and socio-economic benefits will depend on innovative, integrated management of these ecosystems that combines regulatory enforcement with empowered community stewardship.\n\n\n\n\nThe Heuningnes Estuary in the De Mond Nature Reserve is one of South Africa’s 12 estuarine lakes. (© Peter Chadwick)\n\n\nEstuaries, rivers and wetlands in South Africa are more threatened than ecosystems in other realms. Over 90% of estuarine ecosystem types are threatened and less than 10% are Well Protected. Over 60% of river and wetland types are threatened, while less than 10% are Well Protected. These ecosystems face multiple pressures from altered water flows, pollution, land-use changes, poor land management and biological invasions. Barrier structures, such as roads, and commercial forestry further alter stream flow, groundwater recharge, and hydrology of rivers and wetlands. In estuaries, the availability of cheap gill nets from online retailers has led to an increase in illegal fishing, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. This indiscriminate fishing method impacts many biota, such as sharks, rays, invertebrates, birds, turtles, terrapins, and crocodiles, beyond just the targeted fish species. Freshwater ecosystems and estuaries are complex and do not respond linearly to pressures.\nEstuaries, rivers and wetlands are essential ecological infrastructure for water security, food security, tourism, recreation, spiritual and cultural services, as well as disaster risk reduction and carbon sequestration. They are important havens for many threatened and endemic species. Improving their condition will increase the diversity of benefits delivered as well as the number of people who benefit from aquatic ecosystem services.\n\n\n\nRivers, wetlands and estuaries are essential ecological infrastructure for water security, food security, tourism, recreation, disaster risk reduction and carbon sequestration. Careful management and restoration of Strategic Water Source Areas, river floodplains and estuaries are essential for these benefits to continue. There is no buffer alongside this river channel, leading to extensive encroachment of human land uses into the floodplain, heightening risk to agriculture and downstream areas during flooding. (© Jeremy Shelton)\n\n\nThe dire status of South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems has been documented since the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004. In response, ecological infrastructure, including rivers and wetlands, has received attention in various policy instruments, such as the National Infrastructure Plan and the pending National Wetland Policy. There have also been efforts to secure ecological infrastructure, and protect and rehabilitate rivers and wetlands. Estuary Management Plans have been or are being developed for more than 20% of systems. Most freshwater resources have been classified into levels of resource utilisation, although environmental allocations sometimes fall short of biodiversity requirements. However, these responses have yet to improve the threat status or protection level of aquatic ecosystems.\nInnovative approaches are needed that integrate social, economic and ecological considerations, and place people at the centre of environmental stewardship. Citizen science monitoring of aquatic systems is a powerful tool that assists communities to understand and appreciate these ecosystems, and the services they derive from them. In addition, the implementation of regulatory mechanisms such as environmental authorisations, water use licences and biodiversity offsets must include the requisite resources and capacity for compliance monitoring and enforcement. The recovery of fish and invertebrate resources in estuaries calls for a reduction in fishing pressure, prioritising ecological water reserves for estuaries, and increasing citizen awareness.",

Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure with coordinated efforts across all components.\n\nFreshwater flows into the ocean are essential for functioning coastal and marine ecosystems and the species that live in them. Estuaries demonstrate this interconnectivity between land and sea, and more than 20% suffer severely reduced freshwater flow and 32% are under severe pollution pressure. Flow reduction and poor water quality cause poor coastal ecosystem condition and increased species threat in the estuarine and marine realms. South Africa has very few (only 62) remaining free-flowing rivers that reach the coast without substantial barriers limiting flows and species movement. The water from many of the country’s catchments is already fully allocated for human uses inland, leaving ever decreasing volumes to flow into the ocean.  \n\n\n\nFreshwater reaching the sea is not wasted. Sediment-rich clean water, flowing from catchments through estuaries into the ocean, is essential and provides multiple benefits such as nutrients for fish and sand for beaches and dunes (© Darren Hanner). Actions have been identified to track progress in securing freshwater flow to the estuarine and marine realms.\n\n\nSufficient freshwater flow into the ocean maintains water quality, salinity regimes, and estuarine connectivity that supports fish nursery functions vital for marine fisheries. Freshwater flow enables the movement of sand and sediments, maintaining beaches and dunes, which are tourism and coastal resilience assets that help protect people from sea storms. Fisheries associated with muddy ecosystem types (e.g., prawns, sole) require mud delivery through freshwater flows to the sea. Species that move between marine and freshwater environments during their life cycle (e.g., eels [Anguilla spp.] and the commercially-important dusky kob [Argyrosomus japonicus]) are particularly vulnerable when estuarine connectivity and functioning are altered. \nEcological infrastructure, such as catchments, rivers and wetlands, together with built infrastructure, facilitates and regulates freshwater flows into the sea. A lead agency is needed to coordinate the development of an officially accepted standard protocol for the determination and implementation of flow requirements for fluvial-dependent marine ecosystems and resources. Then, alignment of strategies amongst stakeholders, such as the National Water Resources Strategy and Water Resource Classification, can ensure that flow requirements are implemented. Coordinated monitoring, data management and sharing will further support this effort. Investing in water resource monitoring and reporting is crucial to understand trends in streamflow quality and quantity, including associated declining estuary and coastal ecosystem conditions. Natural capital accounting, including the subnational water resource accounts and Strategic Water Source Areas accounts provides insights into how water moves across the landscape. Catchment Management Agencies play a key role by encouraging partnerships across sectors for collaborative water governance. Finally, coastal and estuary management plans must detail freshwater allocation, fish resource use, water quality management and appropriate land-use activities.",

Concentrated fishing pressure by multiple actors, including recreational fisheries, is the cause of ecosystem degradation in some areas and increases extinction risk of target and bycatch species. The many coastal species threatened by fishing include some endemic seabreams, several kob species and some invertebrates. Formerly common species like South African abalone (Haliotis midae), West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) and white mussels (Donax serra) are now Endangered due to overexploitation. Fishing has led to genetic consequences for seventy-four seabream (Polysteganus undulosus) and kob species (Sciaenidae). It also affects many seabirds, including the including the threatened African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), Cape gannet (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorant (Phalacrocorax capensis), and many sharks and rays. Fisheries management efforts have resulted in the partial recovery of some seabream species, including slinger (Chrysoblephus puniceus), carpenter (Argyrozona argyrozona) and Cape bream (Pachymetopon blochii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, Cape bream (Pachymetopon blochii).

(© Geoff Spiby)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverfishing has consequences for food security and livelihoods affecting small-scale, recreational and commercial fisheries. The marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers and has substantial yet unquantified impacts on marine biodiversity and other fishery sectors. Recreational fishers compete with small-scale and commercial fisheries, but remain largely unmonitored and ineffectively regulated.\nTo ensure fair and sustainable fisheries that support ocean life and human livelihoods, effective management plans based on scientific evidence should be implemented for all sectors, to manage the impacts on ecosystems, species, genes and people. Fortunately, the number of assessed stocks has grown due to new methods in stock assessment, and South Africa has made progress with ecological risk assessments. The country can expand on this foundation to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Better inclusion of recreational fisheries in policy and planning could reduce sectoral conflict and ensure equitable resource distribution. Key strategies include rebuilding overfished stocks, enhancing monitoring, and ensuring sufficient capacity for Red List and stock assessments. Specific actions should focus on reducing harmful practices, reducing bycatch, regulating (especially online sales/imports) and reducing gill net use, increasing compliance, improving spatial management, preserving genetic diversity, and promoting responsible resource use. Diversifying shark control measures can help reduce fishing pressure on threatened shark, ray, mammal and turtle species. Ensuring policy coherence and aligning monitoring efforts will be essential to manage growing demand and limited marine resources sustainably.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The negative impacts of pollution continue to increase in South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems, exceeding sustainable limits and affecting biodiversity, human wellbeing, and economic development (established). South Africa has advanced water policy, however, there is a need to strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement for aquatic ecosystems.\nSouth Africa’s rivers, wetlands, groundwater, estuaries and marine ecosystems are vital for water and food security, yet are compromised by pollution that contributes to a third of aquatic ecosystem extent being in poor condition. Half of South Africa’s estuaries have moderate to very high levels of pollution. The pollution originates from point and non-point sources, including agricultural return flow, discharge from wastewater treatment works, sanitation distribution networks, unmanaged urban stormwater, and other production and industrial processes. Poor solid waste management, particularly from rural and peri-urban areas upstream or near to water resources, also impacts water quality. Pollution disrupts the functioning of terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, compromising ecosystem services, causing eutrophication and oxygen depletion and local die-off of aquatic species, and often supporting uncontrolled spread of invasive aquatic plants. Emerging pollutants such as microplastics, persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PFAS1) and pharmaceuticals threaten water safety and aquatic biodiversity. Recent studies have detected DDT2 and other organochlorine pesticides in Lake Sibaya, coral reefs and offshore marine ecosystems.\nSouth Africa’s aquatic ecosystems have limited pollution assimilation capacity, which is being exceeded. Contaminated water has public health implications and reduces the availability of clean drinking water, and water of suitable quality for food production and other economic activities. Toxins from pollution accumulate in food chains, affecting both aquatic life and the human communities that depend on ecosystems for food security and livelihoods. These impacts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities who are directly reliant on natural water sources.\nSouth Africa needs to improve management of pollutants, particularly for wastewater, agricultural runoff, urban stormwater and emerging contaminants. With increased demand on water resources and considering the water-food-energy nexus, there is a need for alignment in policy, law and governance for integrated water quality management. Recent achievements include the publishing of the National Water Resource Strategy III in 2023, the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Coastal Marine Waters in 2022, and the Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill in 2025. These recent advances in water policy now require well-resourced action. It is vital to amplify current investment in modernising wastewater treatment works to ensure they meet current and future demands. Innovative urban drainage solutions should be instituted to improve stormwater management. Pollution levels in aquatic ecosystems should be effectively monitored. Water pollution is a complex developmental, economic, social, and environmental issue. Addressing it effectively requires an integrated, participatory approach and collaborative partnerships across all levels of society, including government, the private sector and civil society.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accelerated climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts on biodiversity and people, with increasing irreversible losses and disturbances (well established). Intact and well-managed biodiversity helps people to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Integrated solutions involving biodiversity, society and climate action are key to adapting to climate change.\n\nClimate change has caused irreversible losses of species and range shifts, as well as changes in ecosystem structure and disturbance regimes in all realms. More than 200 South African species have experienced severe population declines and increased extinction risk due to climate change, such as the iconic halfmens (Pachypodium namaquanum) and Namaqua dune mole rat (Bathyergus janetta). In the South African ocean, climate-driven shifts in prey species’ ranges contribute to a decline in seabird numbers and the worst coral bleaching in history is currently underway. Estuarine fish species (e.g., spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii) have extended their ranges by hundreds of kilometres, changing estuarine food webs. Climate change also amplifies other pressures on biodiversity such as biological invasions, habitat loss, pollution and changes to freshwater flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling up renewable energy is part of South Africa’s Just Energy Transition, and must be accomplished in a way that considers biodiversity. For example, this blade patterning experiment is ongoing at the Umoya wind farm in Hopefield, where painted blades show reduced bird fatalities. (© Robert Simmons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruptive flooding is now a seasonal reality in several provinces due to climate change. In 2022, KwaZulu-Natal experienced extensive flood damage like the Umdloti beachfront in this image (© Ryan Daly). The Palmiet area was less affected thanks to the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project. The project had recruited EnviroChamps from the community to clear alien vegetation along the river and monitor for blockages of sewers and stormwater drains in the two years prior to the 2022 floods.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, climate thresholds have now been reached. The year 2024 was the first on record with a mean temperature more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean. South Africa will likely become drier in the west and have intensified rainfall events in the east, with the interior warming faster than the global terrestrial mean. Biomes will likely change (e.g., Fynbos and Succulent Karoo drier and Savanna more woody), and species extinction risk is likely to increase. Environmental cycles and ecosystem processes that humans depend on are changing. Rising sea levels cause coastal erosion and infrastructure damage; shifting fire regimes impact property and air quality; warmer temperatures threaten water quality through increased eutrophication; and extreme weather events like droughts, heavy rainfalls and strong winds undermine safety and livelihoods.\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy remain important for mitigating climate change. Recognising the connection between climate, biodiversity and society helps to identify additional integrated solutions. Ecosystem-based adaptation is the use of biodiversity to help people adapt to and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Ecological infrastructure, such as wetlands, rivers, estuaries, coastal dunes and kelp forests, helps to protect people and built infrastructure from the impacts of extreme weather events. Well-managed ecological infrastructure can support resilient agricultural production and maintain a steady supply of water. Programmes that maintain and restore ecological infrastructure and ensure connectivity across landscapes and seascapes are cost-effective ways to preserve nature’s adaptive capacity. Investment in inclusive climate action that reduces risk and prioritises equity and justice is essential.",

    "text": "The focus of NBA 2025 was on creating transparent and repeatable workflows hosted on accessible repositories, and ensuring that the entirety of the results expected in the NBA are online via a searchable website. In addition, there was also substantial new work that was accomplished between the release of NBA 2018 and the release of NBA 2025. The following is what is new in NBA 2025:\n\nExcellent progress has been made regarding automated condition assessments to support the NBA 2025 inland wetlands threat status; NBA 2025 provides interim regional wetland types while a rigorous update of the typology is underway to provide more detailed characterisations; and work towards a revised National Wetland Map remains ongoing using a multi-partner, mixed approach that integrates GIS-based wetland predictive modelling, remote sensing and specialist mapping and validation (both field and desktop).\nRiver condition data (PES) was updated nationally as part of a WRC project and this data was used to update and improve river ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe Marine Ecosystem Map Version 2023 is used in this NBA and represents a minor update to the 2018 map, with the reintroduction of a pelagic layer in deeper waters beyond the shelf. In the meantime, a data-driven framework for updating the map has been in development and will represent a more substantial update in time for the next NBA. Condition data was not updated, however assessment methods have been improved.\nThe new version of the Vegetation Map of South Africa, released in early 2025, informed the terrestrial ecosystem assessments.\nVarious research and mapping projects have made new data available on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien plants; these data have been used to improve terrestrial ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe NBA shows trends in terrestrial ecosystem threat status with one of the world’s first applications of the Red List Index for ecosystems (RLIe), showing trends in ecosystem risk. The index can be disaggregated using national biomes or the IUCN Global Ecosystems Typology Level 3 – the latter useful for international comparisons.\nTrends in ecosystem protection level in the terrestrial realm are explored using the new Ecosystem Protection Level Index.\nThree new taxonomic groups have been included in NBA 2025: freshwater crabs, Anostraca (fairy shrimps) and spiders, and revised assessments of birds, mammals, reptile and amphibians have improved the Red List Index that tracks changes in threat status over time.\nBuilding on the efforts begun for NBA 2018, the genetic component of the NBA now pilots international indicators of genetic diversity.\nThanks to Statistics South Africa’s 2024 publication Experimental Biodiversity-based Tourism Estimates for South Africa, the updated Biodiversity Tourism statistics are used in the benefits infographic."

    "text": "The NBA is produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) as part of its mandate to report regularly to the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on the status of the country’s biodiversity. SANBI operates through the Network of Partners Model, recognising that such a technically demanding and wide-ranging scientific assessment cannot be achieved without substantial support from numerous partners. This model not only ensures the completion of the NBA, but also fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa. The co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.\nNBA 2025 would not have been possible without the substantial in-kind contributions of time, data and expertise from numerous individuals and institutions. From November 2019 to October 2025 more than 490 individuals from approximately 110 institutions contributed over 23 000 person-days of work. Their dedication and expertise are sincerely appreciated – the NBA truly is a multi-stakeholder endeavour.\nSANBI is particularly grateful for the strategic and long-term partnerships that supported leadership of the Estuarine (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and Coastal (the Institute for Coastal and Marine Research at Nelson Mandela University) Components of the NBA. Their clear and experienced leadership of these complex components was invaluable.\nVarious governance structures guide the NBA, ensuring a broad range of experts and stakeholders contributed to the assessment. We extend our thanks to the members of the various ecosystem committees and species working groups for their technical inputs; the NBA 2025 Core Reference Group for leading the complex content; the internal SANBI Cross Functional Steering Committee for oversight and support; and the Strategic Advisory Committee (consisting of senior officials from various government departments and entities, non-governmental organisations and private sector associations) for cross-sectoral inputs and advice on communicating NBA 2025 findings. Appreciation also goes to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment intergovernmental structures where the NBA key messages were tabled for inputs.\nFinally, thanks to all the talented photographers who generously donated their images for use in NBA 2025, both in this publication and on the website. Their contributions greatly enrich the presentation and communication of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity."

It is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute’s (SANBI) mandate, in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). The Act specifically states that SANBI ‘must monitor and report regularly to the Minister on (i) the status of the Republic’s biodiversity and (ii) the conservation status of all listed threatened or protected species and listed ecosystems’.\n\n\n\nThe NBA 2025 is the 4th edition released, and the first to be accompanied by a website.\n\n\nThe scope of the NBA is broad, assessing biodiversity at the ecosystem and species level, and addressing aspects of genetic diversity. The assessment covers all of South Africa’s territory, across land and sea, including its subantarctic territory of the Prince Edward Islands. Information is organised by realm (terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine (benthic and pelagic)), and the cross-ream coastal zone and the subantarctic region. For species, information is organised by taxonomic group and summarised for each realm.\nRead more about the purposes and uses of all the NBA products here.",

There are many ways that individuals become involved in the NBA, from contributing data or providing advice, to helping undertake analyses and being part of the author team. This fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa; and this co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.\nThe vast majority of contributions to the NBA is on a volunteer basis without any financial compensation from SANBI. Without these voluntary contributions from experts and institutions outside of SANBI, the NBA would not be possible.",

Almost 1 000 distinct ecosystem types have been described and for the purposes of the NBA these are grouped into four realms: terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine. The cross-realm coastal zone is made up of selected terrestrial and marine ecosystems and all estuaries, and the Subantarctic is made up of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Prince Edward Islands, 1 700 km south of mainland South Africa.\n\n\n\nTundra vegetation on Marion Island– part of South Africa’s subantarctic territory; waterlogged mires, fern-dominated slopes and coastal salt spray habitats can be seen.

Note the logaritmic scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is rich in species (Figure 2) and is home to an estimated 67 000 animal species, although many invertebrates remain undescribed or undiscovered. The 2025 South African National Plant Checklist records 23 514 taxa and 21 539 species, of which 20 204 are indigenous. Remarkably, 60.5% of these indigenous species are endemic to the country.\nCurrent estimates indicate that South Africa harbours approximately 8% of the world’s non-vascular and 6% vascular plant species; and 10% of the world’s dung beetle, 7% of bird, 6% of bee, 5% of mammal, 3% of reptile, 2% of amphibian and 1% of freshwater fish species. In the marine realm, South Africa supports 15% of the world’s shark, ray and chimaera species, 15% of nudibranch, 13% of marine (bony) fish, and 5% of seaweed species (including brown, green and red algae). Several terrestrial invertebrate groups have high richness relative to global statistics, with South Africa hosting nearly 5% of the world’s butterfly, 4% of spider, and 3% of dragonfly and damselfly species.\nTwo-thirds of South Africa’s plant species are endemic, and its cycads represent 10% of the global species count with 92% endemism. Around half of the South African species of amphibians, butterflies, bees, spiders and freshwater fishes are endemic, as are nearly 40% of dung beetle and reptile species. Approximately 30% of seaweed species and 40% of South Africa’s estimated 10 000 marine animal species are endemic, the vast majority being invertebrates.\nMicroorganisms (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, fungi, viruses), an often-overlooked and largely unassessed group, are essential for healthy functioning of natural and agricultural systems in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given the country’s immense diversity of floral and faunal species, and that each species has its own array of microbial species associated with it, it is likely that these are also diverse. For example, it has been estimated that each unique vascular plant species in South Africa is associated with at least seven unique fungal species, implying more than 171 000 fungi species (an underestimate, as fungi associated with invertebrates are not included).\nFind out more in this downloadable biodiversity profile factsheet.\n\nRecommended citation\nDayaram, A., Van der Colff, D., Mtshali, H., Klopper, R., Le Roux, M., Poole, C., Dlamini, T., Sink, K., Currie, J., Skowno, A., Jones, G., Khatieb, S., Mogajane, K., Hamer, M., Truter, M., Jacobs, A., Venter, F., & Seymour, C. 2025.

    "text": "Benefits of biodiversity\nThe 2019 Compendium of Benefits of Biodiversity describes the how biodiversity provides multiple benefits to the economy, society and human wellbeing. The sections below contain a summary of key elements of the Compendium, with edits and some recent additional information. SANBI has prepared a series of factsheets on the benefits of biodiversity and links to these are provided within the relevant section:\n\n1. Biodiversity and jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa’s biodiversity provides substantial employment in a range of sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor every one job involved in managing and conserving biodiversity, there are five jobs in economic sectors that depend on biodiversity. This means that continued investment in biodiversity conservation helps to provide sustainable employment, contributing to one of South Africa’s primary national development goals.\nIn a study completed in 2019, it was estimated that jobs directly related to biodiversity totalled approximately 418 000. This was comparable to the number of jobs in the mining sector at the time and represented 2.6% of national employment. There was agreement that this was likely an underestimate, and that further work was needed to fully and correctly estimate biodiversity-related employment. Work is underway with Statistics South Africa on a Biodiversity Economy Satellite Account.\nImportantly, there are jobs dedicated to managing biodiversity and/or maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure (e.g. in protected areas or conservation authorities) and/or research, and for every one of these jobs there are approximately five other jobs that depend on utilising biodiversity – either consumptive or non-consumptive use. These utilisation jobs are in sectors such as fisheries, wildlife ranching, biodiversity tourism, traditional medicine, crop agriculture, biotrade and more.\n\n\n\nHealthy rangelands are vital to both livestock and wildlife ranching, and there are an estimated 245 000 jobs on these farms across South Africa. (©John Power)\n\n\nMany biodiversity-related jobs are outside major urban centres and are labour intensive, contributing to rural development, poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. In a context where employment in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture is declining, biodiversity-related employment is based on a renewable resource that, if appropriately managed, can provide the foundation for long-term economic activity and growing numbers of jobs. This means that efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity should be seen not as a cost to the economy but as an investment in a resource that supports wider economic activity and employment.\nDownload the Biodiversity provides jobs factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Biodiversity and food security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity is essential for food security.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity plays an important role in commercial agriculture, which supplies food in large quantities to the majority of the population.\nNatural patches that surround farms are the source of pollinators and natural enemies of agricultural pests. Fruit and vegetable crops, which are often pollinated by animals, contain nutrients that are important for health. South Africa is unique in that it uses two indigenous sub-species of bees for pollination, which are far more disease resistant than managed alien honey bees used in other parts of the globe. Natural predators also help to control pests that destroy crops.\nMore than 70% of South African land is used as grazing for livestock or game, sectors that are extremely important to the South African economy because only 11% of our agricultural land is suitable for cultivation.\nIn many parts of South Africa, people rely on foods collected directly from the wild, including 1 300 edible plant species and many edible insect species.\nNumerous coastal communities rely on subsistence fishing for food, and South Africa’s 22 commercial fisheries extract many tonnes of seafood from the ocean annually.\n\n\n\nApproximately 147 coastal communities in South Africa participate in small-scale fishing, and the marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers. (© Ryan Daly)\n\n\nIn addition to direct benefits, there are numerous soil, nutrient cycling and water-related ecosystem services that create the necessary environment for productive agriculture and that support the harvesting of wild species for food.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Biodiversity and water security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa is a water scarce country, and healthy rivers and wetlands help to ensure the flow and quality of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) are the 10% of the land area of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini that supply 50% of water to these countries. They are a vital form of ecological infrastructure, feeding major dams and providing water that is essential for people and the economy, often in urban centres some distance from the SWSAs themselves. Sound science has been used to delineate SWSAs for surface water and groundwater, and to better understand their contributions and the pressures they face. Securing SWSAs will involve implementing a range of different mechanisms to protect, restore, manage and monitor them. Doing so across this small fraction of land will help to reduce risks to water security now and in the future. The benefits for water security will become even more important as South Africa adapts to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nSWSAs are vital ecological infrastructure for national water security.

Ecological infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEcological infrastructure is as important as built infrastructure, especially for climate resilience and adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystems, climate and human society are all deeply interconnected. Healthy ecosystems act as living infrastructure that provides services such as filtering water, moderating floods, storing carbon, and helping communities adapt to climate change.\nEcological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that generate or deliver valuable services to people, such as freshwater, climate regulation, soil formation and disaster risk reduction. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is just as important for providing services to people and underpinning socio-economic development. Ecological infrastructure includes, for instance, healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. South Africa has abundant ecological infrastructure, providing opportunities to support development and unlock economic potential. Ecological infrastructure’s value is seldom captured in market transactions and we tend to under-invest in it. Some examples of the range of benefits provided by ecological infrastructure to the public are:\n\nSouth Africa is a water scare country, and ecological infrastructure such as healthy catchments, wetlands and riparian areas supports numerous water-related ecosystem services, including regulating the flow and quality of water;\necological infrastructure on the coast, such as dunes and kelp forests, provides protection of built infrastructure from natural hazards;\nestuaries are vital ecological infrastructure for food security, as they provide a nursery function for important fish species;\necological infrastructure, like wetlands, rivers and their catchments, coastal dunes and healthy rangelands, help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change (known as Ecosystem-based Adaptation); and can help to protect communities from the impacts of extreme weather events, and make the provision of food and water more resilient to changes in climate.\n\nMaintaining functional ecological infrastructure in strategically important areas will secure and improve various ecosystem services important to South Africans, enhancing investments in built infrastructure, complimenting national parks and protected areas, supporting rural development, job creation and job security, and supporting water and food security. Maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure are cost-effective ways to lessen the impacts of climate change on society and the economy.\nDownload the 2023 Ecological infrastructure for climate change adaptation factsheet.\nDownload the 2013 Ecological infrastructure factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The biodiversity economy and innovations from biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has a growing biodiversity economy based on indigenous mammals and our unique flora.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are an estimated 10 000 wildlife ranches that engage in a range of commercial activities such as ecotourism, intensive game breeding, live game sales, trophy hunting and biltong hunting. Game meat and biltong are produced from 21 different species. The most recent estimates (2015) show that the economic contribution of the sector may be as much as R14.4 billion, directly providing 65 000 jobs. The fact that wildlife can be private or communal property has resulted in stable or increasing large mammal populations in South Africa. This industry relies heavily on biodiversity, and wildlife ranching is a vitally important land use for both socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. However, it can have negative impacts on biodiversity if conducted too intensively.\n\n\n\nFencing in wildife ranches allows for intensive management but carries an environmental cost. (© John Power)\n\n\nA 2015 survey found that there are 549 retail products that contain South African indigenous plant resources and/or bee products from just 24 South African species. There is likely large potential for growth in the bioprospecting sector, with potential for more retail products that make use of resources from indigenous species.\nSouth Africa’s flora is world-renown and supplies important horticultural gems to the world. For example, our indigenous Strelitzia reginae (bird of paradise) flower was crowned the flower of Los Angeles in 1952. Species of the Cape flora, especially, rank among the world’s favourites. Breeders have invested huge effort and expertise towards the production of new and exciting ornamental and cut flower selections. Species and hybrids of South African genera that are in high demand are: Agapanthus, Arctotis, Crocosmia, Disa, Eucomis, Erica, Haemanthus, Ixia, Lachenalia, Leucadendron, Leucospermum, Lobelia, Mimetes, Nerine, Nymphaea, Ornithogalum, Osteospermum, Pelargonium, Protea, Rhodohypoxis, Serruria, Sparaxis, Strelitzia, Streptocarpus, Tulbaghia, Venidium, Watsonia and Zantedeschia. Many of South Africa’s indigenous plants are still awaiting research to unlock their full potential and maximise the opportunities offered by our exceptionally rich floral wealth to ensure that local people benefit from this potentially valuable resource.\nSouth Africa has a list of 1 593 taxa (species, subspecies and varieties), and 220 of these are priority indigenous taxa, that are important relatives of commercial crops around the world. These crop wild relatives are a vital resource of genetic material that can be used in plant breeding to enhance crop production. Several areas around South Africa have been identified as important areas for crop wild relative richness.\nBiomimicry is the process of learning from nature and emulating its forms and processes in engineered situations. Several biomimicry solutions have been gleaned from South African species, such as tougher ceramics based on the strong structure of abalone shells, wind turbine design based on whale flippers, and architectural cooling based on termite mounds.\nDownload the The Biodiversity Economy Project factsheet. This project was initiated in 2022 to expand protected areas across the country, while also ensuring that the communities located within and around these areas will reap the benefits associated with their local biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Biodiversity and tourism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTourism is a large and growing contributor to the South African economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country’s striking natural scenery and rich biodiversity are popular drawcards, with beaches, coral reefs, kelp forests, mountains and wildlife some of the top tourism attractions. Biodiversity tourism is tourism that involves the use or enjoyment of biodiversity. In 2019, domestic and international biodiversity visitors collectively spent R60.6 billion in South Africa, providing 91 836 jobs. Protecting South Africa’s wealth of biodiversity assets will safeguard one of the country’s most competitive tourism advantages, and ensure that biodiversity tourism can increasingly create revenue and jobs.\n\n\n\nIn 2019 biodiversity tourism contributed R27.7 billion to GDP. (© John Power)\n\n\nDownload Biodiversity is a tourism asset factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Biodiversity and health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity is important for South African’s health and everyday wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiencing nature has mental and physical health benefits and is important for South African’s everyday wellbeing. Studies show that natural green spaces can improve the mental health of urban residents, and an active outdoor lifestyle can promote physical wellness.\nNatural areas in cities can help filter out air pollution and reduce urban heat effects.\nThere are approximately 2 000 medicinal plant species in South Africa, and around 656 are commonly-traded. Remedies that use medicinal plants are based on centuries of cultural practice and indigenous and knowledge. The traditional medicine sector operates in parallel with allopathic medicine. Synthesising work undertaken in 2018 (a report done for SANBI title ‘Understanding the diverse economic value of medicinal plants to the South African economy’) revealed the following:\n\nTraditional medicines are used by 70% of South Africa’s people, are essential to the work of some 200 000 Traditional Health Practitioners and provide a further ~93 000 income generating activities in the informal sector for harvesters and traders.\nIt is estimated that the informal African Traditional Medicine (ATM) industry is valued at about R18 billion per year.\nAs much as 40 000 tonnes of medicinal plant raw material are traded per year in the informal sector.\n\nIncreases in volumes traded are having a negative impact of the threat status of a number of species – the Red List assessments from 2024 show that 143 medicinal plant species are threatened (14 Critically Endangered species, 44 Endangered, and 85 Vulnerable), and a further 69 species are of conservation concern (e.g. Near Threatened, Rare or Data Deficient).\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Biodiversity and cultural or spiritual practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many South African societies, people believe in a vital spiritual or cultural connection with an animal, plant or place. There is increasing evidence that interacting with nature brings measurable emotional and mental benefits to people as well as physical benefits, and that a decline in this interaction can cause deficits. Natural spaces and indigenous species have huge value and significance to South Africans no matter whether we live in an urban or rural environment. Biodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life, as well as a role in our enjoyment of life.\n\n\n\nNatural places are important for various cultural and spiritual practices. (© Peter Chadwick)\n\n\nOur natural ecosystems, plants and animals have influenced our evolution and cultural and spiritual development. These influences are woven into languages and place names, as well as the religion and folklore supporting spiritual and cultural life. This web of associations with biodiversity forms an important part of South Africans’ national identity.\nSpecies with cultural or spiritual significance include Tulbaghia violaceace, Cymbopogon validus, Bucorvus leadbeateri and Lamprophis fuiginosus among many others.\nThere are some exceptional natural areas in South Africa that are associated with cultural and spiritual beliefs and are considered sacred sites. Examples include Mapungubwe Hill, Table Mountain, Gompo’s Rock and Lake Fundudzi. These sites, which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance, are a vital part of connecting communities to their heritage, and hold potential as other effective area-based conservation measures if they are not already under some form of protection.\nBiodiversity also provides opportunities for education (outdoor classrooms) and for ordinary citizens to contribute to biodiversity science across the country through citizen science initiatives.",

    "text": "The various products of the NBA\nThe NBA’s products can be summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInput datasets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA has a strong focus on presenting spatial information (e.g. maps of ecosystem types, maps of ecological condition, species distribution maps, maps of threat status and protection level, etc.), and also makes non-spatial datasets available (e.g. species checklists). Each of these datasets are accompanied by their metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWorkflows for analyses and indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nA key focus of NBA 2025 was to ensure that the workflows for undertaking these analyses were published on repositories such as GitHub. This ensures that the NBA analyses are reproducible and mitigates any loss of knowledge or data should there be a change in staff undertaking the analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteResults of analyses\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of NBA analyses are usually indicators or other metrics, dispalyed as graphs or maps. These are all made available for users, with a recommended citation. Workflows and analytical code and documentation are available in various repositories (e.g. GitHub), technical reports are (available through FigShare, Dryad or similar, or SANBIs institutional document library - OPUS) and through publised scientific articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key messages distill some of the most important findings of the NBA in a way that is accessible to various audiences. Each key message includes a summary paragraph with a confidence statement. The messages draw on evidence from an NBA analysis (e.g. Red List status, ecological condition); describe why this is important (e.g. what are the consequences for people); and give some practical actions, responses and interventions that can be done. The key messages should be considered with their underlying data and analyses to inform sector-specific strategies and action plans, cross-sectoral planning and interventions, research strategies, scenario planning, and other action plans or response strategies that may be co-produced subsequent to the NBA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFacts and statistics about the benefits of biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the seven goals of the NBA is to highlight the benefits of biodiversity for people and the economy. There is a webpage on the ‘importance of South Africa’s biodiversity’ and each key message contains some information on why the finding is important. Links to additional information about nature’s contributions to people are also provided throughout the NBA website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePriority actions, responses and interventions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA indicators reveal potential avenues through which pressures on biodiversity can be reduced and biodiversity conservation outcomes and sustainable resource management may be improved. Each key message in the NBA makes a ‘call to action’ that addresses the finding and identifies specific interventions that could be considered. Through this process, the NBA contributes to the body of knowledge that enables the multitude of stakeholders to co-develop, through participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, the various policy responses and detailed action and implementation plans required for the benefit of both biodiversity and people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummaries\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch via surveys, consultations and a systematic review after NBA 2018 revealed that few users want a full printed synthesis book and that most users want to search for exactly what they are interested in. The move to the online website with regular updates is accommodating user needs. However, the value of a shorter less-technical printed booklet is still recognised for several reasons – including: it is a tangible product for high-level officials to showcase at a launch function; it provides media personnel with a colourful summary that may entice them into exploring certain NBA results more deeply; it serves to entice new users of the NBA into exploring the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePopular products\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other popular products are created from NBA results, and may depend on the audience – e.g. press releases, films, pre-recorded PowerPoint presentations, fact sheets, social media posts, conference presentations, popular articles, etc. Some of these items form part of the NBA Communication Plan, which is aimed for immediately pre- and post- the NBA release event, and are produced by SANBI and its NBA partners. However, all users of the NBA are welcome and encouraged to create their own popular products - making use of the results in ways that are meaningful for their particular audience.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Uncoordinated land- and sea-use changes cause biodiversity loss, degrade ecosystems and undermine the ecosystem services they provide (established). Biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services to support people and the economy. Strengthening collaborative, biodiversity-inclusive planning is essential to safeguard South Africa’s natural capital while enabling development.\n\nAcross the country’s landscapes and seascapes, habitat loss, fragmentation and declining ecological function are reducing the capacity of natural systems to deliver crucial services. On land, habitat loss is primarily driven by expanding human settlements and the establishment of new croplands, with over 100 000ha lost annually between 1990 and 2022. Encouragingly, the rate of loss shows signs of slowing since 2014. In the freshwater and estuarine realms, direct habitat loss from, for example, mining, croplands and housing developments, is a major pressure on aquatic biodiversity, alongside flow reduction and pollution. Direct habitat loss from mining and energy generation is relatively limited compared to other forms of land use (&lt;1% of land in South Africa), but intense, persistent and cumulative impacts often extend beyond the direct footprint, especially in aquatic realms where effects cannot be easily contained. In the marine realm, there are substantial direct impacts on biodiversity from coastal and offshore mining, and oil and gas extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand mining is an escalating pressure on the South African coast and in estuaries, impacting coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.

When these developments are positioned appropriately and managed sustainably, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation can be prevented. Healthy ecosystems are the foundation for South Africa’s social, economic, and environmental wellbeing. They provide essential services to sustain life and livelihoods such as clean water, food security, climate regulation and disaster risk reduction.\nSouth Africa has a strong foundation for systematic biodiversity planning and supportive legislation, but implementation gaps remain. Action is urgently needed to better integrate biodiversity into spatial planning and decision-making at all levels of government and across all sectors. Development decisions should be informed by the best available science and local knowledge, ensuring that future land- and sea-uses align with ecological sustainability. Strategic Environmental Assessments, updated environmental guidelines (such as the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline), and enhanced cross-sector coordination are required to manage cumulative impacts to safeguard species and ecosystems. By strengthening participatory, integrated, biodiversity-inclusive planning, and embedding biodiversity considerations into all development processes, South Africa can balance economic growth with the protection of its natural capital, securing the ecosystem services that are needed to support current and future generations.",

    "text": "South Africa has over 3 500 alien species present outside of captivity or cultivation, at least a third of which are invasive (established but incomplete). New alien species arrive every year and those present in the country continue to spread and cause negative impacts. Better planning and monitoring are required to ensure effectiveness of interventions aimed at managing biological invasions for the benefit of biodiversity, people and the economy.\n\nSince 2018, South Africa has detected around three new alien species per year. Invasive species continue to spread and are found throughout the country. The national survey of invasive plants showed that coverage of selected invasive species increased by 10.6% between 2008 and 2023. Recent estimates indicate that 17% of terrestrial ecosystem types show greater than 10% cover by invasive alien plants. Biological invasions contribute to the listing of 31% of threatened terrestrial ecosystems, and 36% of all threatened species. \nInvasive alien species are having increasing impacts on nature, water security, people and the economy. Studies show that biological invasions use 3–5% of South Africa’s precious surface water runoff each year, which is a direct threat to water security in a water-scarce country. They also reduce the value of livestock production from natural rangelands by R340 million per year, impacting both food security and livelihoods.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s third national report The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa (2022) provides important information and recommended actions. (© SANBI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive species, such as the black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) pictured here, are found across the country, impacting many Strategic Water Source Areas (© Tsamaelo Malebu). Efforts to improve water security by clearing alien plants in catchments are ongoing at various scales, For example, the efforts of the Greater Cape Town Water Fund has resulted in clearing of more than 46 000 ha of invasive trees in five years (2018-2023), with an estimated recovery of over 15.2 billion liters of water per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge of the distributions of alien plants has increased through the national survey, as well as through citizen science and the digitisation of historical records. Biological invasions have also been successfully managed in some cases, including through biological control, with positive returns on investment. Successful eradication includes the estuarine cordgrass (Sporobolus alterniflorus) from the Great Brak Estuary and the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from the Rondegat River. Prevention is crucial, through management of introduction pathways, particularly in marine systems where eradication is often unfeasible. Finalisation of the Ballast Water Management Bill is essential to preventing marine introductions. The establishment of the Border Management Authority aims to improve the prevention of illegal and accidental introductions. Management plans with clear goals and consistent monitoring will improve the effectiveness of invasive species control. Several global and national initiatives provide a framework for managing invasive species. These include the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 6) and the Invasive Alien Species Assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. At a national level, South Africa is guided by the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa’s Biodiversity and the draft National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan. With judicious investment and integrated governance, the impact of biological invasions on South African society can be reduced and any potential benefits researched and optimised.",

    "text": "Illegal harvesting and trade of South Africa’s species is increasing, with conventional law enforcement and legislative approaches failing to prevent population decline and near extinction of several species (established). Interventions that increase revenue within the conservation sector and contribute meaningfully to local livelihoods are required.\nSouth Africa’s rich biodiversity, combined with socio-economic challenges, has led to increasing illegal trade of numerous high value species in all realms. Around 9 500 southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum; Near Threatened) were poached between 2010 and 2023. Tens of thousands of plants of South Africa’s 37 cycad species (Encephalartos spp.), 71% of which are threatened, have been illegally harvested from wild populations in the last three decades – even from protected areas. A lack of effective guardianship of Endangered South African abalone (Haliotis midae) has seen an estimated 90% reduction in abundance over the past 35 years. The West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) has changed from Least Concern to Endangered largely because of illegal fishing. Official seizures and analyses of online trade show that reptiles, medicinal plants, seahorses, pipefish, sea cucumbers, marine gastropods (cowries, cone-shells, etc.), fish maw (swim bladders) and live ornamental aquarium species (including sharks, rays and corals), are being targeted. Some illegal harvesting methods (e.g., the use of gill nets for illegal fishing) are indiscriminate, affecting non-target species as well.\nSince 2020, illegal harvesting of ornamental succulent and geophytic plants, in high demand in Europe and Asia, has seen a dramatic escalation in the Succulent Karoo Biome where range-restricted endemic plant species are easily accessible and local people have limited livelihood opportunities. Over 1.1 million harvested plants have been confiscated, 632 species populations are in decline, and the populations of 12 endemic species have been reduced to functional extinction1.\nAddressing illegal wildlife trade through conventional law enforcement, focussed on stringent legislative measures such as trade prohibitions, is failing. For example, despite substantial enforcement, policy and management efforts directed towards curbing the poaching of rhinos, many have been killed within state-owned protected areas, leaving the private sector with the responsibility of protecting just over half the national herd. Similarly, 96 million South African abalone have been poached in 10 years, despite a severely reduced catch limit for the legal fishery. Many of the comprehensive response strategies and management plans, particularly for cycads and succulents, are severely under-resourced and poorly implemented, while conservation agencies lack resources for effective compliance measures.\nContributing to a sustainable biodiversity economy through legal trade offers a new frontier for addressing wildlife crime by supplying persistent demand whilst directly tackling socio-economic challenges and generating funds for conservation. Molecular techniques, such as DNA and stable isotope forensics, as well as the use of artificial intelligence, 3D printing and other accessible digital technologies that improve monitoring, training and databasing, provide innovative technological solutions for ensuring that trade is well-regulated and does not threaten wild populations.",

A whole-of-society approach is required for recovery efforts to meet national and international responsibilities.\n\nSouth Africa’s most threatened taxonomic groups are freshwater fishes, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) and succulent plants. Up to 66% of freshwater fish taxa are threatened, due to invasive alien fish and habitat modification. Other plants, reptiles, birds and mammals are also showing increased rates of decline over the past decade. More than 100 species have moved from Least Concern to threatened categories on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2018. The main cause has been population reductions linked to climate change (see key message A1) in the western parts of the country impacted by severe drought. The worst impacted region is northern Namaqualand, where endemic plants, beach macrofauna and reptiles have also experienced declines as a result of expanding mining activities. The increase in illegal trade has caused severe declines to species in use (see key message A6), including endemic plants, some marine invertebrates and cartilaginous fishes. Estuarine degradation, fishing and lethal shark control measures contribute to the threat status of cartilaginous fishes. Their decline is a global trend, yet with several endemic species, South Africa has a responsibility to protect them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) and green sawfish (P.  zijsron), were once common along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and in estuaries, but are now considered Critically Endangered within our waters (© Dennis King). Building on progress, South Africa can further diversify and modernise shark management measures to improve marine species status without unduly increasing risks to bathers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 55 plant species endemic to the Richtersveld region have been uplisted to highly threatened categories since NBA 2018 due to the combined impacts of climate change and rapidly expanding mining activities. All three species of tree aloes found in the Richtersveld, including this quivertree (Aloidendron dichotomum, Vunerable), were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2022 as threatened as a result of population declines due to climate change. (© Wendy Foden)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe threatened status of several nearshore marine species is of concern for food and livelihood security (see key message A5), as is the status of other species harvested for food and medicine. Species support crop agriculture, the wildlife economy, tourism and many other jobs. South Africa is a megadiverse nation and has committed to global efforts to address the species extinction crisis. Target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for a concerted effort to halt human induced extinction of threatened species and for the recovery and conservation of species.\nSouth Africa has many conservation tools available for species recovery. Sufficient resourcing is required to ensure Red List assessments are conducted and updated for all taxonomic groups at least every 10 years. Additional species information needs to be included in the National Environmental Screening Tool, particularly for the marine realm, and in Spatial Development Frameworks and Integrated Development Plans. In cases where species have experienced extreme losses and recovery is required, multiple partners need to work together. South Africa’s Centre for Species Survival and the IUCN National Species Specialist Group have developed and costed recovery plans that estimate a 10-fold increase in spending on species recovery is required for South Africa to meet its obligation under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Expanding protected and conserved areas and improving their effectiveness for under protected and threatened species remains crucial to safeguard South Africa’s rich species diversity (See key message B4).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The first assessment of genetic health based on two international indicators suggests declines in the genetic diversity of South Africa’s species (established but incomplete). More South African taxa need to be assessed to better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, and genetic richness analyses need to be incorporated into protected area expansion strategies.\n\n\nThe Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 4) uses the proportion of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 (Ne 500 indicator) to assess genetic health. Ne represents the number of breeding individuals in a population. When Ne is above 500, populations are large enough to sustain genetic diversity. Populations below this threshold lose genetic diversity, increasing their risk of extinction. An initial assessment of 126 species from various taxonomic groups in South Africa, across different ecosystems and threat levels, found an Ne 500 score of 0.42, meaning that 58% of assessed populations are below the threshold, suggesting substantial genetic erosion. These populations are smaller than is necessary to ensure their long-term persistence and the overall adaptive potential of the species. Alarmingly, even Least Concern and Near Threatened species showed poor genetic indicators, suggesting undetected genetic decline not captured by extinction risk assessments. Similar trends have been seen globally. A complementary indicator tracks the proportion of species’ populations still present (PM indicator). South Africa scored 0.95, suggesting that most populations of the assessed species have not yet disappeared. This offers hope that with effective management, the genetic health of South Africa’s species can still be recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus). (© Tim Kuiper)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. The brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea). (© Endangered Wildlife Trust)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA and B: these two species are categorised as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, yet their genetic population size (Ne) may already fall below the threshold for long-term survival. Falling below the threshold of Ne &gt; 500 raises concerns about species’ abilities to maintain genetic health and adapt to environmental change.\n\n\nGenetic diversity underpins a species ability to adapt to environmental changes. Low genetic diversity increases extinction risk, especially under pressures such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, inbreeding, hybridisation, unsustainable use and poorly managed translocations. Safeguarding evolutionarily distinctive species will enable adaptive potential to be maintained within an ever-changing environment. \nTo better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, efforts are underway to assess complete taxonomic groups. Increased investment is needed in genetic monitoring (i.e., comparing genetic metrics at multiple time points) to acquire more precise estimates of genetic indicators. Additional indicators based on phylogenetic diversity (e.g., the EDGE index – evolutionarily distinct, globally endangered; and the Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity indicator) are being piloted, and are important for ensuring that evolutionarily distinctive species are protected. Importantly, environmental impact assessments and spatial planning should integrate landscape-level genetic richness, particularly for threatened species, by using genetic data or their proxies in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, in systematic biodiversity planning and for strengthening the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy.",

    "text": "Nature’s contributions to people are at risk due to poor ecological condition of ecosystems and pressures on important species (established). Restoration and recovery programmes, that are guided by science, implemented collaboratively and properly monitored are essential to ensure lasting benefits for both people and nature.\n\n\n\n\nIt is vital that ecosystem restoration and species recovery programmes are designed scientifically, and then evaluated for their effectiveness so that future programmes are cost-effective and have the best possible results for people and biodiversity. Species recovery projects may involve costly translocation efforts – here some leopards are checked before their relocation. (© North West Department of Economic Development, Environment, Conservation & Tourism)\n\n\nMore than half of South African ecosystems are in poor ecological condition. A particularly high proportion of wetland (51%), river (75%), estuarine (82%) and coastal (48%) ecosystem extent is Moderately to Critically Modified. Species also suffer from multiple pressures, including unsustainable use, poaching or other impacts from human activities (e.g., pollution).\nOften, the ecosystems and species that are most useful to people are those whose condition deteriorates the most. Wetland and river ecosystems provide people with essential water, and estuarine and coastal ecosystems are widely used for recreation, fishing and settlements. These ecosystems begin to lose their ability to provide these vital services as their condition deteriorates. In the same way, species that are used for harvesting or trade are susceptible to unsustainable use that threatens the resource. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 2) calls for 30% of degraded ecosystems to be under effective restoration by 2030 in order to enhance ecological integrity and recover the benefits people receive from ecosystems. Target 4 calls for the recovery and conservation of species, in particular threatened species. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification also sets targets to avoid and slow degradation, and restore degraded lands to a natural, productive state (also part of the Sustainable Development Goals).  \nPreventing species decline or ecosystem degradation should always be the primary focus. However, species recovery and ecosystem restoration programmes can be effective interventions when done in a responsible and scientifically sound manner. Prioritising where such initiatives should occur can ensure cost-effectiveness and lasting positive impacts for both people and biodiversity. Several recent initiatives focus on using spatial biodiversity data to scientifically plan restoration initiatives. For example, the National Coastal and Marine Spatial Biodiversity Plan has been used to identify strategic priorities for restoration in coastal and marine ecosystems, and South Africa’s Essential Life Support Action Areas map identified areas that should be prioritised for restoration on land. These efforts reiterate the value of spatial biodiversity information, such as the NBA threat status and protection level analyses, in supporting national priorities and actions. Species recovery initiatives should be equally well planned, as it is estimated that investments exceeding R1 billion are needed over the next five years to recover species under severe threat in South Africa (see key message B1). Monitoring and evaluating (see key message C2) of ecosystem restoration and species recovery interventions is crucial yet often neglected. Counterfactual impact evaluation and a national information system for restoration and recovery programmes are both essential for adaptive management, improving future projects and reporting meaningfully. Restoration and recovery should always be a collaborative effort, involving indigenous knowledge and a whole-of-society approach to future-proof programmes with diverse stakeholder expertise.",

However, gaps remain in the monitoring and detection of changes in species populations, ecological condition and community composition across realms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen science empowers individuals, schools and communities to contribute to biodiversity monitoring. Here a budding citizen scientist is taking a soil sample in a wetland area.

Occurrence data from this programme was served through the SeaMap Project, and are contributing to a more data-driven marine ecosystem map and spatial biodiversity planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring allows for a comprehensive understanding of a system or process by tracking trends across time and space. It directly supports decision-makers to identify emerging issues of concern and adjust management actions to address these. The collation of data from various field-based monitoring efforts supports reporting on the status of biodiversity at the provincial, national and international scales. Strengthening monitoring mechanisms and coordination will be crucial for driving accountability, transparency, and learning through the revised National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). A robust national biodiversity monitoring framework can play a pivotal role, and its success will depend on: i) the extent to which national indicators comprehensively reflect the goals and targets of both the NBSAP and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; ii) the degree to which the three spheres of government, non-state actors, and other stakeholders actively adopt and apply the national monitoring system in planning and reporting; and iii) the accessibility and openness of biodiversity data and metadata ensuring that information is shared widely, used meaningfully, and contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of South Africa’s biodiversity. \nBiodiversity monitoring can be advanced by investment in innovative technology and data science. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, are particularly useful for unobtrusively monitoring vast, inaccessible areas. Artificial intelligence can process and analyse large volumes of data to identify subtle changes in real-time, allowing for more proactive responses to emerging pressures. Biodiversity monitoring should also align with global best practices and build on existing international monitoring initiatives. Partnering with international institutions and initiatives will enable enhanced technical support, harmonised data collection standards, access to advanced technologies, and invaluable insights into the creation of data processing workflows. Monitoring should continue to harness the value of citizen science, which reduces data collection costs while increasing the scale of data collection. Citizen science has the added benefit of empowering individuals to contribute to conservation efforts and strengthening community involvement in addressing global challenges like climate change. Citizen science programmes require constant fund raising and awareness building, and coordinated campaigns to secure these efforts are essential.\n\n\n\nThe Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers (CREW) Programme has a dedicated network of citizen scientists who upload observations to iNaturalist.

Protected areas are vital for ecological sustainability and climate-change adaptation. They also serve as the backbone of the ecological infrastructure network, protecting the areas that deliver important ecosystem services to people.\nEPL is calculated using protected areas, recognised under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003)2. The Act provides for several categories of protected areas, including Special Nature Reserves, National Parks, Nature Reserves, Marine Protected Areas, and Protected Environments. In addition, it also recognises World Heritage Core Sites, especially Protected Forest Areas, and Mountain Catchment Areas. The EPL indicator does include a narrow range of legally secure Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) as contributing to meeting protection targets (Figure 1) and, as additional OECMs are evaluated and mapped across the country they will be considered in the computation of the indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

With the publication of the Global Biodiversity Framework (most notably Target 3), a 30% target has been adopted for the NBA 2025 ecosystem protection level indicator.

    "text": "Threat categories\nThe system uses quantitative criteria to assign species to categories indicating relative risk of extinction, from Least Concern (low risk of extinction) to Critically Endangered (highest risk of extinction). The criteria are based on scientific evidence of factors influencing risk of extinction across all species, except micro-organisms1. It is designed to be applicable under various levels of data quality and uncertainty, but species can also be classified as Data Deficient when they are too poorly known to determine their risk of extinction. Species classified as Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable are collectively referred to as threatened species.\nSpecies are classified as Extinct only when there is no reasonable doubt that there are no remaining living individuals of the species, with the aim to avoid erroneous classifications that may lead to the withdrawal of conservation efforts. Some Critically Endangered species are tagged “possibly extinct”. This tag is used to highlight species that are suspected to be extinct, but the strong evidence required to confirm extinction is not yet available. Species that remain only in cultivation or captivity are classified as Extinct in the Wild.\nFor most South African species assessments apply only to the parts of a species’ range within the borders of South Africa and its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the region of ocean that extends 200 nautical miles from the coast. For species that are not endemic to South Africa, in other words, their distribution extends beyond the borders of South Africa or the EEZ, the IUCN’s regional assessment procedures are applied. An exception is made for species with only a very small proportion (&lt;5%) of their global range inside South Africa, where the species’ global status is adopted as the national status. This avoids potential over-inflation of threatened species lists with species that may have restricted distributions in South Africa, putting them at higher potential risk of local extinction, while they are widespread and not at risk of extinction outside South Africa.\nThe use of regional assessment methods introduces an additional national sub-category of extinction, Regionally Extinct (RE), which indicates species that are extinct within South Africa, but may persist elsewhere outside the country. Some taxonomic groups choose to distinguish species that are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), but have narrow distribution ranges (typically less than 500 km2) in the national sub-category Rare. These species are considered national conservation priorities despite their classification as Least Concern under the IUCN system.\nSouth Africa’s Species Threat Status indicator therefore reports the proportion of species in each of 10 national threat categories (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

IUCN Red List criteria is typically applied to all indigenous species in a taxon group, not just those that are suspected to be in danger of extinction. Incomplete or selective assessments may present a biased view of the state of biodiversity, and could result in inappropriate allocation of scarce conservation resources, and even undetected extinctions3,4.\nA key feature of biodiversity reporting is measuring how species’ risk of extinction change over time, as a means of detecting whether targets to avoid species extinctions are being met. Tracking trends in risk of extinction requires regular reassessments of species’ risk of extinction, which can be challenging in highly speciose groups such as plants. For such groups, an alternative approach is to take a random sample of species from national checklists of indigenous species, and focus more regular reassessment efforts on the selected species. The statistical assumption is that because the sample is random, trends in extinction risk in the sampled species is representative of true trends in the taxon group5. When sampling, South Africa follows the recommended sample size of 900 species6.\nNational Red List assessments for animals are reported on SANBI’s Red List of South African species website, while assessments for plants can be found at the Red List of South African plants website.",

    "text": "Red List Index of species\nThe Red List Index of species (RLI) combines the risk of extinction of all species in a comprehensively assessed taxon group or a representative sample into a single statistic that can be used to track changes in species’ risk of extinction over time. The index follows a process of retrospectively adjusting species’ assessments at earlier time points so that only genuine changes in extinction risk are included in the index7.\nThe index value ranges from 0 to 1. Values closer to 0 indicate higher proportions of species at high risk of extinction, with 0 reached when all species are extinct. Values closer to 1 indicate higher proportions of species at low risk of extinction, with all species being Least Concern resulting in an index value of 1. The slope of the line between time points indicate how fast species are moving towards extinction (negative trends) or recovering (positive trends), with steeper lines indicating faster decline or recovery. Strong negative changes in the slope of the index are indicative of rapidly emerging pressures on species that require urgent action.\nSouth Africa uses species’ national Red List status when calculating the national RLI, rather than the global disaggregation method of area-weighted adjustments to species’ global Red List status8. This method is preferred because South Africa invests significant efforts into species conservation, resulting in some species assessed nationally at a lower risk of extinction than their global assessments.\nThe RLI is calculated by applying weights to Red List categories in increasing order of risk of extinction, from 0 for Least Concern, to 5 for Extinct/Extinct in the Wild. The number of species in each category is multiplied by the category weight, and these values are summed. This value is compared to a maximum value where all species would be extinct. Data Deficient species are excluded from the index calculation, but used to inform the confidence intervals of the indicator value7. More Data Deficient species means larger uncertainty around the indicator value.\nThe formula for calculating the RLI is as follows:\n\\[\nRLI_t = 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_s W_{c(t,s)}}{W_{EX} \\cdot N}\n\\] where:\n\nWc(t,s) is the weight for threat category c at time t for species s\nWEX is the weight for the Extinct category\nN is the number of species assessed, excluding those that are Data Deficient",

    "text": "The trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI). The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1 where lower values indicate that more species within the taxonomic group are at a high risk of extinction, the slope of the plot shows the rate of decline towards extinction. If the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The RLI is calculated only for comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups or groups where a representative sample has been selected. Changes in status over time have been tracked for 13 taxonomic groups (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The Red List Index (RLI) for taxonomic groups assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time, e.g., note the sharp decline in sharks, birds, mammals and plants. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). The newly assessed group Anostraca (fairy shrimps) are threatened by degradation of ephemeral wetlands. *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the threat status is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nIncreases in extinction risk are evident for most groups, but a marked increase in rate of extinction since the last assessment is evident from the change in slope of declines for reptiles, birds, mammals and plants (Figure 1). Increases in threat status for birds have largely been due to freshwater birds impacted by increasing levels of pollution and other forms of habitat degradation, while the main drivers of declines for mammals, plants and reptiles have been climate change and loss of habitat for mining and renewable energy developments. Most plants that have been uplisted due to increasing levels of extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape (Figure 2). The province was severely impacted by the drought over the past decade, and is experiencing ongoing pressure from mining, succulent poaching and renewable energy developments. The two groups at highest risk of extinction are freshwater fishes and cartilaginous fishes. Sharks, rays and chimaeras are included on South Africa’s RLI for the first time, with the majority having wide ranges that extend outside South African territory. Many of these cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, have slow growth and low reproductive output, and many are declining across their ranges due to overfishing (including from recreational fisheries and as bycatch from industrial fisheries), lethal bather protection measures and habitat degradation. Half of South Africa’s freshwater fishes are endemic, with many concentrated in Western Cape river systems. While only due for reassessment in 2026, the declining status of rivers and dwindling resources available for management actions where many of these species are concentrated likely means that they will continue on a declining trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The distribution and density of species (per km2) that have increased in threat status since NBA 2018, for A, plants; B, terrestrial and freshwater animals; and C, marine animals (including sharks, sparids and marine birds only). Plants in the Northern Cape’s Namaqualand region are under the most severe pressure from climate change related drought, mining and succulent poaching, while the impacts on terrestrial and freshwater animals are widespread but linked to areas with high habitat loss and degradation. In the marine realm, increased risk to species is attributed to multiple pressures with coastal mining, estuarine degradation, flow reduction, overfishing and lethal shark control measures contributing to worsening species threat status.",

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. The indicator was developed in South Africa and has been used as a headline indicator in national reporting since 2005. Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined targets ranging from 16 to 32% (linked to the extent and condition of types within protected areas). Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about the indicator here.\nWetlands and rivers have the lowest overall protection levels of any realm, with over 80% of ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected (referred to as under-protected) (Figure 3). This is driven in part by the poor ecosystem condition of many freshwater ecosystems (only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem targets). A high proportion of estuarine ecosystem types have some level of protection, but very few are considered Well Protected. Protecting estuaries is challenging, given the range of pressures that can impact them directly and their upstream catchment areas. Marine protection improved dramatically in 2018/2019 with the declaration of 20 new Marine Protected Areas – this translates into higher levels of protection within the marine realm when compared to the terrestrial realm. The marine realm has a small number of large ecosystem types that are under-protected and this results in a difference between the percentage of types in each category (Figure 3) and the extent of each category (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Number of ecosystem types in each protection level category in each realm (A), the percentage extent in each category in each realm (B) (for rivers length is used as the unit of extent, for all other realms area is used). In addition to the realms, the plot also shows results for the coastal zone, made up of estuaries and selected marine and terrestrial types, and the subantarctic territory of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial patterns of protection level reflect the geography of the protected area network: terrestrial ecosystem types around large national parks (e.g., Kruger National Park in the northeast of the country) are Well Protected (Figure 4 A). Under-protected regions on the mainland include the grasslands of the Free State and interior of the Eastern Cape, and the Nama Karoo. Other gaps in the protected area network are evident in the offshore eastern portion of the marine realm, the southern Eastern Cape coast and the Northern Cape coast (Figure 4 A, B). Most coastal ecosystem types are represented in protected areas, although only a quarter of the extent is Well or Moderately Protected. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area in South Africa’s subantarctic territory provides protection to most ecosystem types, with almost half the types being Well Protected, however, these comprise a small portion of the territory (Figure 4 E).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Ecosystem types that are highly threatened (Critically Endangered or Endangered) but under-protected (Not Protected or Poorly Protected) can be considered to be in urgent need of conservation action (Figure 5). Priority ecosystem types could need additional protection, focussed management intervention or could be restoration priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Highly threatened and under-protected ecosystems of the marine and terrestrial realms (other realms not visible at this scale).\n\n\n\n\nIn the marine realm, 17% (27/163) of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under-protected, prevalent on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge and parts of the Kwazulu-Natal Bight.\nA quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types (115/463) are highly threatened and under-protected. The Fynbos Biome and Namaqualand contain many Critically Endangered and under-protected ecosystem types while the grasslands of the interior and the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt have many Endangered and under-protected types.\nOver a third of river ecosystem types (82/222) and a third of wetland types (29/82) are highly threatened and under-protected.

The NBA 2025 adopted this approach with some minor language changes. Figure 1 is for the realms, the coast and the subantarctic, and Figure 2 is for taxonomic groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Key pressures on biodiversity in each realm, informed by Red List of Threatened Species and Red List of Ecosystems assessments. The size of the bubbles indicates the relative importance (on a scale of 0-5) of each pressure class.\n\n\n\nIn the estuarine and marine realms, and in coastal areas, unsustainable use of biological resources (in this case overfishing of key species, along with associated impacts on non-target species) is a significant pressure on biodiversity (key messages A5 and A6). There is increasing illegal harvesting and trade of numerous high value species in the terrestrial and aquatic realms, with population declines and near extinction of several species. Overuse of rangelands, which results in loss of shrub and herbaceous cover and leads to increased erosion, is a direct pressure to terrestrial species and ecosystems and an indirect pressure on freshwater ecosystems.\nModifications to natural systems such as changes in hydrological regime are major pressures on biodiversity in freshwater, estuarine, many coastal and selected terrestrial ecosystems (key message A7). Over-abstraction of water and dam construction have direct negative impacts on species and ecosystems, and indirect impacts through disruption of important ecological processes such as sediment supply.\nChanges to fire regimes linked to management imperatives, climate (drought events and high winds) and an increase in fuel loads from invasive alien plants are important natural system modifications in the terrestrial realm that have a detrimental impact on biodiversity. Species that have evolved special adaptations to survive fire, such as certain lycaenid butterflies and Fynbos plants, struggle to cope with fires that have increased intensity and occur more frequently than in the past. South Africa’s iconic Brenton blue butterfly has likely gone extinct as a result of high invasive plant fuel loads in the Garden Route region of South Africa coupled with climate change linked intense wildfires.\nPollution of aquatic ecosystems from a combination of acid mine drainage, mining, industrial and urban wastewater, stormwater, as well as agricultural return flows, negatively impact water quality (key message A3). When combined with flow regime changes, pollution represents a major additional pressure on freshwater, estuarine and coastal biodiversity. For example, freshwater bird species are becoming more threatened due to pollution.\nClimate change is an accelerating threat across all realms, and amplifies other pressures such as invasive species, disease, habitat loss, flow reduction and habitat degradation (key message A1). Climate change may also be associated with more severe or extended droughts. Multiple indigenous terrestrial species from the western arid regions of South Africa have experienced significant population declines as a result of a severe extended drought over the past decade. Though impacts of climate change on biodiversity are best understood in the terrestrial realm, coastal and estuarine ecosystems are particularly at risk from extreme weather events, especially where human settlements limit the natural resilience of these ecosystems by encroaching into dune systems and the Estuarine Functional Zone.\nHabitat loss as a result of land clearing for croplands, plantation forestry, human settlements and mining is the primary pressure in the terrestrial realm (key message A2). Mining is one of the main drivers of increased risk of extinction for reptiles, mammals, amphibians and plants, and several coastal ecosystem types in Namaqualand. Intensive agriculture, in the form of croplands and pastures, significantly impacts most terrestrial and freshwater species groups assessed to date.\nBiological invasions impact all realms, with predatory alien fishes substantially impacting indigenous fish species in rivers (key message A4). A wide range of woody invasive plant species impact riverine areas, wetlands and mountain catchments in particular and cause severe declines to South Africa’s indigenous plants and amphibians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "The IUCN proposes a threats classification scheme with a hierarchical structure for various pressures on biodiversity. The NBA 2025 adopted this approach with some minor language changes. Figure 1 is for the realms, the coast and the subantarctic, and Figure 2 is for taxonomic groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Key pressures on biodiversity in each realm, informed by Red List of Threatened Species and Red List of Ecosystems assessments. The size of the bubbles indicates the relative importance (on a scale of 0-5) of each pressure class.\n\n\n\nIn the estuarine and marine realms, and in coastal areas, unsustainable use of biological resources (in this case overfishing of key species, along with associated impacts on non-target species) is a significant pressure on biodiversity (key messages A5 and A6). There is increasing illegal harvesting and trade of numerous high value species in the terrestrial and aquatic realms, with population declines and near extinction of several species. Overuse of rangelands, which results in loss of shrub and herbaceous cover and leads to increased erosion, is a direct pressure to terrestrial species and ecosystems and an indirect pressure on freshwater ecosystems.\nModifications to natural systems such as changes in hydrological regime are major pressures on biodiversity in freshwater, estuarine, many coastal and selected terrestrial ecosystems (key message A7). Over-abstraction of water and dam construction have direct negative impacts on species and ecosystems, and indirect impacts through disruption of important ecological processes such as sediment supply.\nChanges to fire regimes linked to management imperatives, climate (drought events and high winds) and an increase in fuel loads from invasive alien plants are important natural system modifications in the terrestrial realm that have a detrimental impact on biodiversity. Species that have evolved special adaptations to survive fire, such as certain lycaenid butterflies and Fynbos plants, struggle to cope with fires that have increased intensity and occur more frequently than in the past. South Africa’s iconic Brenton blue butterfly has likely gone extinct as a result of high invasive plant fuel loads in the Garden Route region of South Africa coupled with climate change linked intense wildfires.\nPollution of aquatic ecosystems from a combination of acid mine drainage, mining, industrial and urban wastewater, stormwater, as well as agricultural return flows, negatively impact water quality (key message A3). When combined with flow regime changes, pollution represents a major additional pressure on freshwater, estuarine and coastal biodiversity. For example, freshwater bird species are becoming more threatened due to pollution.\nClimate change is an accelerating threat across all realms, and amplifies other pressures such as invasive species, disease, habitat loss, flow reduction and habitat degradation (key message A1). Climate change may also be associated with more severe or extended droughts.

    "text": "Ecological condition across realms\nEcological condition is estimated using a range of different approaches across the realms, but is essentially the product of spatially representing the various pressures exerted on biodiversity. Ecological condition in the terrestrial realm relies primarily on land cover change, invasive species and overgrazing data; cumulative pressure mapping is used in the marine realm; and a multi-criteria ecological condition framework is used in the estuarine and freshwater realms. The different systems were aligned as far as possible in the NBA to allow for cross-realm comparisons of ecosystem condition and unified terminology.\nThe marine and terrestrial realms are similar in terms of their relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (~70%). In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact (Figure 3). For example, the Cape lowlands have extensive winter field crops while the mountainous areas of the Cape see far less intensive agriculture; all bay ecosystem types, the shelf edge and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight are subject to multiple pressures while many deep-sea ecosystems beyond the shelf have yet to see extensive modification.\nIn stark contrast, freshwater wetlands and rivers, as well as estuaries, are predominantly heavily modified, and in poor ecological condition (key message B2). These realms are geographically constrained, and pressures tend to concentrate. Only 18% of estuarine area, 49% of wetland area and 25% of river length are considered to be in natural/near-natural condition. Coastal biodiversity is also under particularly high pressure and approximately half of the ecologically determined coastal zone remains in a natural/near-natural condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Ecological condition map (terrestrial and marine). The legend shows the categories used across the different realms.

While there are some long-term site-based and species monitoring programmes, many suffer from a lack of resources. Abiotic information (e.g., water turbidity, sediments, temperature, pesticide load, microplastics, etc.) is crucial for mapping ecosystems and their condition, and much of this information is not collected and/or poorly understood in terms of their impacts on ecological condition.

Initiatives such as the SeaMap and REFRESH projects have helped fill some gaps in marine and freshwater invertebrate data, yet limited taxonomic capacity, few full-time taxonomist positions and declining collections expertise remain major constraints.

The mapping and classification of South Africa’s aquatic systems, especially riparian areas, wetlands and the deep sea, remain a challenge due to limited foundational data and ground-truthing.\n\n\nMeasuring and mapping ecological condition and pressures data\nEcological condition data underpins our ability to assess the risk of collapse of ecosystems. Since the NBA 2018, new data on invasive alien plant species density and distribution have enhanced our RLE assessments on land, and focussed research on rangeland condition is starting to bear fruit – though comprehensive data sets will only be finalised in 2026-2027. Climate change models have improved and inform species assessments, and will be used in future ecosystem assessments. Marine pressure data are outdated and limits reliable condition assessment in the marine realm. Recently, extensive ecological modelling work has resulted in comprehensive wetland health data. The automated WET-Health 2.0 links seamlessly to the widely used field assessment methodology, and allows broad assumptions to be drawn on which driving component (hydrology, water quality, vegetation or geomorphology) is most impacted per wetland, each wetland buffer and the wetland’s receiving catchment.

Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined ecosystem targets (ranging from 16 to 32%)1,2. Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about this indicator on the about ecosystem protection level page.\nOver three-quarters (76%) of South Africa’s 463 terrestrial ecosystems received some form of statutory protection. However, levels of protection vary widely; 121 ecosystems are Well Protected, 67 are Moderately Protected, 163 are Poorly Protected and 112 are Not Protected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This expansion reflects the declaration of new protected areas primarily through biodiversity stewardship programs. Other effective area based conservation measures (OECMs) have not yet been fully assessed and mapped in South Africa and it is likely that the Protected and Conserved Areas estate (including both PAs and OECMs) covers substantially more than 10% of the landmass. key message B4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Protected Areas in the Terrestrial realm circa 2024.\n\n\n\n\nBiome and provincial level results\nAt a biome level, most Well Protected ecosystems are concentrated in the Fynbos (38) and Savanna (27). The very large National Parks (Khalahari Gemsbok and Kruger) in the Savanna Biome and the extensive Provincial Protected Areas and Mountain Catchment Areas in the Fynbos Biome mean that protection targets for numerous ecosystem types are met or exceeded. The Forest Biome, which has a limited natural extent in South Africa, is Well Protected, in part due to regulations related to the National Forests Act4 and cultural practices. In contrast lowland Fynbos, grassland and Karoo ecosystems tend to be under protected (Poorly Protected or Not Protected) (Figure 3) reflecting the need to improve their representation in the protected area network (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Protection level map of terrestrial ecosystem types. The inset graph shows the percentage of ecosystem types that fall within each protection category.\n\n\n\nEcosystem protection patterns at the provincial scale largely mirror those observed at the biome level. The Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape contain the highest numbers of under-represented ecosystems within the protected area network (Figure 3), many of which overlap with the Cape Floristic Region, a globally recognised biodiversity hotspot with exceptionally high ecosystem diversity. In contrast, provinces such as Gauteng and Limpopo, which have fewer ecosystems overall, still exhibit a high proportion of under-protected ecosystems (Figure 2), highlighting persistent gaps in representation even where total ecosystem numbers are lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Protection level per terrestrial biome (A) and per province (B); the percentage of ecosystem types within each protection level category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem Protection Level Index\nEcosystem Protection Level can be tracked over time using the ecosystem protection level index (EPLI). The overall (aggregate) trend between 2018 and 2024 reflects the steady increase in the PA estate overall, mostly due to various biodiversity stewardship programs and the establishment of a new National Park in the Nama-Karoo (note the low level of protection for the Nama-Karoo and the more pronounced increase in protection level since 2018). The EPLI plot shows how well protected the Forest Biome is, but it also shows that that no increase in protection have occurred in the biome recently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

    "text": "Approach\nTerrestrial ecosystem protection level was calculated by assessing the degree to which protected areas targets for each ecosystem were met. Land cover, invasive alien plant data, terrestrial ecosystem maps (vegetation map) and protected areas maps for 2018 and 2024 were cross tabulated, allowing the calculation for each ecosystem type: i) the full extent of the type, ii) the full extent of the type within the PA network, iii) natural remaining the extent of the type within the PA network (including invaded areas), iv) the extent of invasion by alien plants within the PA network for each type.\nThe extent of each type within the PA network was adjusted for habitat loss and invasion. The natural remaining extent within the PA network was adjusted downwards by subtracting 70% of the invaded extent within the PA network. This step ensures that effectiveness of PA network is accounted for to a degree by preventing areas heavily degraded by invasive alien plants from fully contributing to ecosystem representation targets.\nEcosystem protection level index (EPLI) calculation (Harris et al., in review) is based on the concept of the Red List Index of Species and tracks changes in protection categories between time points (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.

    "section": "Habitat loss",
    "text": "Habitat loss\nThe loss of natural habitat is the single biggest cause of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the terrestrial environment. Outright loss of natural habitat takes place mainly as a result of conversion of natural vegetation for cultivation of croplands, mining, plantation forestry, human settlements and other infrastructure development1. Patterns and trends linked to land-use and land cover change are closely linked to changes in terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem extent. Habitat loss is also usually associated with habitat fragmentation, which further impacts ecological functioning and viability of species, particularly in the context of climate change and biological invasions.\nBased on the national land cover, 81% of South Africa (986 051 km2) was in a natural state in 1990 (Table 1). By 2022 natural areas were estimated to have declined to 78% (946 090 km2). Habitat loss, as a result of historical (1750–1990) and recent (1990– 2022) clearing of natural habitat for field crops, horticultural crops and planted pastures, is the largest pressure on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity in South Africa and has affected 17% of the land area.\nClearing of natural habitat for new croplands between 1990 and 2022 amounted to 13 676 km2. The relatively mesic eastern portions of South Africa and the Fynbos and Renosterveld of the Cape lowlands were the most impacted by this clearing (Figure 1). Built-up areas (including rural and urban settlements, industrial and commercial areas and large infrastructure) also contribute to natural habitat loss and currently cover over 2.9% of the country. The rate of habitat loss linked to new built-up areas is increasing, especially in Gauteng and along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and adjacent interior. Plantation forestry (including non-native pine, eucalyptus and acacia species) is an important historical driver of habitat loss in mesic grassland regions, in particular (covering 21 573 km2). However, the rate of habitat loss to plantations is decreasing.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Land cover change matrix 1990 - 2022, showing totals per land cover class and transitions between classes.

The ecological condition in these areas ranges from near-natural to critically modified depending on the degree to which ecosystem structure, function and composition have been altered through rangeland livestock and game management. Fire plays a crucial role in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna ecology; disruption of natural fire regimes (fire season, frequency and intensity) presents an important pressure on biodiversity. Biological invasions also impact rangelands and are discussed below. Unfortunately, there is currently limited spatial data with which to assess these impacts at the scale of ecosystem types, though various assessments of South African rangelands have shown that bush encroachment is widespread. Recent work indicates lower levels of use and an improvement in primary productivity and natural vegetation cover in some rangelands2–4.",

    "text": "Biological invasions\nBiological invasions, especially by invasive alien plants, are a major pressure on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the terrestrial realm. A national report is released every three years – providing a comprehensive assessment of “The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa”. The report details alien species introduction pathways, their distribution and abundance, their impacts and the various interventions that have been put in place5.\nOf the 1 715 terrestrial alien species recorded (or assumed to be present) in South Africa, 611 are known to be invasive, 117 are known to be naturalised but not invasive, and 482 are present, but not naturalised6. For the remainder (505 species), there is insufficient information to assign them to an introduction status category. While the majority of invasive species have relatively restricted distributions there are some (plants and birds in particular) that are widespread. Invasive species have a range of impacts on biodiversity, displacing indigenous species, disturbing habitats and disrupting ecosystem functioning7. Australian acacias, for example, can form closed canopy stands that exclude indigenous species, change fire regimes and impact surface water runoff, negatively impacting biodiversity and water catchment function. Herbaceous and succulent species such as Triffid Weed (Chromolaena odorata) can severely reduce rangeland productivity and thus the livelihoods of rural people; while invasive grasses such Reed Meadow (Glyceria maxima) and Giant Reed (Arundo donax) can dominate riparian areas and displace native species. Examples of severe impacts in other high-level taxa include competitive displacement and predation on native species by domestic cats (Felis catus) and from invasive birds such as Rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameria), House crow (Corvus splendens), and Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis)8. Overall, alien plants are the most diverse, widespread and damaging group of invaders in South Africa. Furthermore, it is clear that South Africa has a major alien plant invasion debt. Over half of the taxa that are present are plants, and the range of almost all invasive alien plants have increased significantly9. This is a major cause for concern, as it clearly indicates that problems associated with alien species are set to increase.",

    "text": "Climate change\nSince the 2018 NBA, there has been a global acceleration in the rates of global warming, with 2024 exceeding the historic baseline by 1.5 °C for the first time. The interior of southern Africa continues to warm faster than the global terrestrial mean10. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change have become increasingly visible in most ecological processes with disruptions evident from the genetic to the landscape levels. Abiotic pressures affecting the terrestrial realm include increases in dry spell duration, mean and maximum temperatures, wind, wildfires, sea level; and increases in the frequency and intensity of storm surges, extreme rainfall events and both more frequent and hotter hot days11. Annual rainfall has both increased and decreased in different regions and overall changes in rainfall seasonality have been noted. Evidence of early impacts of climate change on species is rapidly accumulating, with 70 amphibian species contracting their geographic ranges, at least partly due to climate change impacts on freshwater systems. Large-scale die-offs of desert plant communities have been documented, along with shifting migration times and range contractions for bird species. Fynbos community composition has also been shown to have altered due to climate change. Over the past century one of the most pervasive structural changes observed has been an increase in the density and spread of woody species in grassy biomes. This global trend, known as bush encroachment or woody thickening, is widespread in southern African grasslands, open savannas and mixed grass/shrub ecosystems. Research has shown that a changing climate and rising CO2 are probable background drivers of extensive and broad-scale switches towards greater woody plant cover, but that other important drivers (fire and grazing/browsing) influence the rate of this change12–14. These widespread ecological shifts have triggered plant and animal community reorganisations, net declines in biodiversity and changes in landuse activities. These alarming shifts, which are projected to intensify rapidly as climate thresholds are exceeded, drive the urgent need for climate change mitigation and management of interacting change drivers15. Climate impacts on biodiversity will be amplified by land transformation and biological invasions as discussed above. Since progressive climatic, CO2 and resulting biodiversity changes are now inevitable, a fundamental review of conservation objectives and desired outcomes that accommodate climate change impacts is essential, along with planning and implementation of targeted conservation interventions. These need to be supported by a wider array of long-term monitoring efforts, including the effectiveness of the new climate-smart conservation approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. A “perfect storm” of land degradation in the Richtersveld\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change and human activities are creating a “perfect storm” of degradation in the Richtersveld region of the Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot, where over 100 km2 of formerly species-rich vegetation has severely declined or been replaced by sparse desert grassland16. While localized anthropogenic impacts from livestock farming, mining, and road construction trigger initial vegetation loss and mobilize wind-borne sand and dust, these effects are amplified by climate change factors including an unprecedented nine-year drought (2011-2019), increased temperatures, and stronger winds that cause cascading desertification processes through soil erosion and sand burial. The interaction between these drivers has transformed productive silty soils into sandy desert soils, creating potentially irreversible regime shifts where Succulent Karoo flora is being replaced by Namib Desert species, representing an unprecedented southward expansion of desert ecosystems in this global biodiversity hotspot.\n\n\n\nLandscape level change in the arid Kuboes region of the Northern Cape between 1910 and 2023, documented by Professor Norbert Jurgens and colleagues. Perennial shrub cover (Mesembryanthemum pseudoschlichtianum) has been lost, leaving bare saline soils with occasional annual species. Decades of overgrazing by livestock in combination with intense drought between 2017 and 2019 have changed the topsoil structure and severely altered ecosystem function and composition.

In South Africa, animals and plants are commonly used as traditional medicine for both the treating of ailments and for cultural purposes. The NBA 2018 reported that over 2 000 indigenous plant species have documented traditional medicinal uses. Some 656 medicinal plant species are common in trade and many are unsustainably harvested, with 184 species declining due to excessive use and 56 listed as threatened. Approximately 147 vertebrate species, representing about 9% of the total number of vertebrate species in South Africa, are traded for traditional purposes. Vultures are particularly threatened by cultural use and it has been estimated that 29% of local vulture deaths are due to harvesting for traditional purposes. Harvesting for traditional medicine has increased pressure on endemic species of reptiles, such as the Sungazer Lizard (Smaug giganteus). Expansion of human settlements, especially in areas bordering protected areas, has resulted in increased hunting intensity for bushmeat and/or traditional medicine and cultural regalia, with species including Leopard (Panthera pardus), Temminck’s Ground Pangolin (Smutsia temminckii) and Oribi (Ourebia ourebi).",

    "text": "Freshwater fishes are among the most threatened species groups in South Africa, and the majority of the country’s endemic fish species are in ongoing decline. Key pressures include impacts on water quality and quantity, habitat destruction and the impacts of invasive species – pressures that often act synergistically and can be compounded by climate change.\nIn 2024, as groundwork for the Reverse the Red World Species Congress, members of the National Freshwater Fish Observation Group (including SANBI, SAIAB, CapeNature, Freshwater Research Centre) undertook a rapid assessment of South African freshwater fish species most urgently in need of recovery action, including species with recovery efforts already underway. The focus was on species with Endangered or Critically Endangered conservation status, and those with a declining population trajectory.\nAssessments were attempted for 26 described freshwater fish species, and 10 recognised genetically distinct lineages. Expert knowledge was used to identify priority conservation actions for each taxon, as well as the cost for implementing these actions. Assessments were completed for nine of the 26 described species and for five of the 10 genetic lineages; however, experts noted low confidence for several of these assessments. Furthermore, 12 of the taxa were not assessed due to insufficient expert knowledge.\nOf the assessed taxa: all were considered in need of management actions and/or associated research; 11 were identified as in need of ex situ breeding programmes; 10 taxa were expected to benefit from new stewardship sites; and all 14 were considered in need of further research to identify the most suitable recovery actions. Investment in freshwater fish recovery efforts over the past 10 years was estimated at R18 million – a figure that would need to be increased nearly tenfold (to at least R168 million) to meet the recovery needs of freshwater fish species in South Africa over the next 5-10 years.",

This section summarises key recovery efforts focussing on threatened South African freshwater fish taxa over the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Jeremy Shelton\n\n\n\n\nClanwilliam sandfish, Labeo seeberi (EN)\n\n\n\nThe Saving Sandfish project, led by the Freshwater Research Centre (FRC), aims to prevent the extinction of the Endangered Clanwilliam sandfish (Labeo seeberi) in South Africa’s Olifants-Doring river system by boosting juvenile fish recruitment and restoring critical habitat. The approach involves rescuing thousands of young sandfish from high-risk habitats in the Biedouw River (a critical spawning tributary where invasive predatory fish and water abstraction prevent successful recruitment), relocating them into off-stream ‘sanctuary’ dams free of alien species, growing them until they reach a size that reduces predation risk, marking them with PIT tags, and then releasing them back into the wild once they are large enough to avoid predation by invasive fish like bass (Micropterus spp.). Progress to date includes the rescue of over 45 000 juveniles, the establishment of six sanctuary dams, and the reintroduction of over 5 000 ‘bass-proof’ fish into the wild. An ongoing PIT tag study shows that up to 20% of these fish return to the Biedouw River with the annual spawning migration in spring, translating into a an estimated nearly four-fold increase in the Biedouw spawning sandfish population. In 2024/5, a habitat restoration intervention was undertaken to restore 9 km of critical sandfish habitat in the upper Biedouw River through the removal of invasive fish and plants, and the construction of a barrier weir to prevent future reinvasion. By combining an urgent on-the-ground programme with longer-term habitat restoration, the project seeks to transition from emergency intervention to establishing self-sustaining wild sandfish populations.\nFunders: National geographic Society, Species Survival Commission, Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, IUCN Save our Species, Foundation Segre, European Union, Rufford Foundation, Ford Wildlife Foundation, Federation of South African Flyfishers, Mount Ceder, Bushmanskloof, Alu-Cab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Jeremy Shelton\n\n\n\n\nTradouw redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli (CR)\n\n\n\nThe Grootvadersbosch Conservancy is leading a conservation project for the Tradouw redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli) in the Huis–Tradouw River system near Barrydale, Western Cape, aimed at securing the species’ survival through habitat restoration, community engagement, and improved water management. Key actions include restoring river flows, clearing invasive riparian vegetation, controlling alien fish threats, and promoting water-wise practices. The conservancy is working closely with the Barrydale community and local municipality to improve the water efficiency of the local water use system (reducing dependence on the river during dry spells) and building on earlier efforts that included retrofitting water release valves on the weir to maintain ecological flow. Invasive plant removal continues to improve both water quantity and quality, while stakeholder capacity is being strengthened through training, signage, and local employment. Awareness campaigns, open days, and workshops help residents understand the importance of the Huis River’s health and the plight of its unique species. All activities are integrated into a Species Action Plan developed with government partners to ensure long-term protection and recovery of this Critically Endangered fish. In addition, a translocation programme is under development to identify and establish new habitats to safeguard the redfin, including suitable upstream reaches and farm dams free of invasive species.\nFunders: WWF Nedbank Green Trust, IUCN Save our Species¬, Species Survival Commission, Foundation Segre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Andrew Deacon\n\n\n\n\nOrange-fringed largemouth bream, Chetia brevis (EN)\n\n\n\nThis project is led by SAIAB, in collaboration with the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA), retired specialists, students and staff from Nelson Mandela University, and the Eswatini Department of Fisheries. All historical collection sites for the Orange-fringed largemouth bream (Chetia brevis) have been resurveyed, revealing a substantial decline in both population size and area of occurrence. The main threats are invasion by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the lower Lomati River in South Africa, and pollution from gold mining in the upper river reaches in Eswatini. Based on these findings, the species has been reassessed under the IUCN Red List and uplisted to Critically Endangered (assessment under review).\nTo support recovery, farm dams within or near the Lomati catchment have been stocked with wild-caught and captive-bred individuals. To date, 23 dams have been stocked in Eswatini and South Africa (including dams within the Kruger National Park), with an estimated ~50% showing signs of success by 2025. Additional stocking has also been done in the upper river within the species’ historical range. The captive breeding programme has been highly successful, with &gt;30 breeding events producing ~1 500 juveniles. However, under IUCN guidelines, stocked individuals can only be considered part of the natural population once they persist independently in natural systems for at least ten years, as this species generation length is estimated as 3-4 years (active research underway to confirm this estimate). In total, more than 30 000 fish (wild and captive-bred) have been stocked in dams.\nWorking with local farmers has enabled access to suitable dams and logistical support. In Eswatini, engagement with the Department of Fisheries aims to support community-based dam management to prevent over-harvesting, as these dams provide food resources. Concurrently, multiple Masters research projects are underway (2023–2027, Nelson Mandela University George Campus) to study the age, growth and fecundity of the species to inform a sound long-term conservation plan.

The approach includes tagging and monitoring released fish to track survival, growth and dispersal, alongside outreach with landowners, fishers and schools to build support for the species’ recovery.

Activities include extensive field surveys across 15 rivers in a catchment area of approximately 72 500 ha, stakeholder engagement (including landowners and schools with over 500 pupils reached), and data collection to feed into longer-term restoration actions. By gathering baseline data and raising awareness, the project is building the foundation for future habitat restoration and alien fish removal work that will aim to create safe sanctuary zones for the Agulhas redfin’s recovery. Key mitigation activities to date include: removal of alien invasive fish from the river system (581 and counting); translocation of over 400 redfins to off-stream dams to establish breeding populations for future reintroduction programmes; and an environmental impact assessment process underway for an alien fish barrier to safeguard the critical Agulhas redfin habitat.\nFunders: Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, IUCN Save our Species, Foundation Segre.",

    "text": "Threat status and pressures\nAlbatrosses constitute the most threatened group of seabirds in South African waters with nine threatened species including five Endangered and one Critically Endangered species, the Tristan albatross1. The latter species has approximately 8000 individuals remaining, the majority of which breed on Gough Island (Banda 2025c). All threatened albatross species that regularly occur in South African waters are exposed to threats at sea in the form of bycatch from longline and trawl fisheries (Maree et al. 2014, Rollinson et al. 2017;1) (Figure 1). Albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters are also threatened at their breeding colonies by invasive alien mammals such as house mice which prey on these species that breed on Marion and Gough islands. All three threatened penguin species, African, Gentoo and Southern rockhopper penguins are exposed to a plethora of threats including climate change, disease, pollution and human disturbance (Hagen 2025, Makhado et al. 2025b, Makhado and Crawford 2025a) (Figure 2). Cormorants have a high proportion of threatened species which include two Endangered species (Cape and Bank cormorants) that are endemic to the cool Benguela upwelling ecosystem off South Africa and Namibia (Box 1). Just over a quarter of the global population of the regionally Endangered Crozet Shag breed at the Prince Edward Islands where their declining population is likely linked to prey availability and exposure to human disturbance (Makhado and Crawford 2025b). Two Endangered tern species, Kergeulen tern on Prince Edward Islands and Damara tern from mainland southern Africa both have very small populations of approximately 50 pairs within the region; the primary reason for their Endangered status (Makhado et al. 2025c, Whittington 2025).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Trends - The Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using a global standard indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) of species2. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List status over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for bird taxa assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\nSeabirds constitute the most threatened group of birds in South Africa1 and globally (Dias et al. 2019). Despite this negative comparative status among bird groups, the number of uplisted seabird species in South Africa has been balanced by the same number of species that have been downlisted, i.e. four species for each, in the 2025 regional Red List assessment. Examples of species that have acquired improved conservation status include the Black-browed albatross (downlisted from Near Threatened in 2015 to Least Concern in 2025, (Angel 2025) and Spectacled petrel (downlisted from Vulnerable in 2015 to Near Threatened in 2025, (Banda and Smit-Robinson 2023). The former species was previously exposed to high levels of unmitigated fisheries bycatch in both their breeding and non-breeding ranges – a situation that has improved through the scaling up of bycatch mitigation measures throughout the range of this species. Spectacled petrel populations have increased since the local extinction of feral pigs on their major breeding colony on Inaccessible Island in the 1980s. Uplisted species include two pelagic species that breed in the Prince Edward Islands, Light-mantled albatross and Grey petrel both of which experience significant mortalities due to longline fishery bycatch; both these species are also susceptible to mortalities by invasive mice on Marion Island (Banda 2025a & b).\n\n\n\nSpectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata) populations have increased since the local extinction of feral pigs on their major breeding colony on Inaccessible Island in the 1980s.

The regional Red List assessment of birds in 2025 marked the first instance in which all seven of these species were classified as threatened. Three species: African penguin (now globally Critically Endangered), Cape cormorant (globally and regionally Endangered) and Cape gannet (regionally Vulnerable and globally Endangered) have been classified as regionally threatened for greater than a decade largely due to their reliance on small pelagic fish, such as sardine and anchovy, and threats associated with the availability of this prey such as resource competition by the commercial purse-seine fishery and climate driven range shifts in these prey species (Hagen 2025, McInnes et al. 2025a, Pistorius 2025). Hartlaub’s gull and Crowned cormorant have been uplisted to Vulnerable due to a combination of threats including human disturbance at breeding colonies, predation and diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (Makhado et al. 2025a, McInnes et al. 2025b). Bank cormorants have been listed as regionally threatened throughout this century due to a combination of threats including a decline in their major prey species, most notably west coast rock lobster, but also breeding failure associated with climate change driven intensification of storm events and heat exposure (Shaw and Crawford 2025). The relatively small population of Damara terns in South Africa have continued to decline largely due to disturbance at their coastal nesting sites (Whittington 2025).",

    "text": "Recovery effort\nAs part of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4, signatories are committed to taking urgent action to halt human-induced extinctions, reduce species’ risk of extinction, and improve their conservation status by 2030. Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts to prevent and reverse species declines, recover and conserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity, particularly among threatened species. South Africa has initiated a process for each of the taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed following the IUCN Red List criteria, to identify and prioritise species that are in urgent need of interventions to promote their recovery to contribute to achieving the GBF Target 4 goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Mouse-Free Marion.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, invasive species are among the greatest threats to seabirds. South Africa’s sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group (comprising Marion and Prince Edward islands) provides critical breeding grounds for Southern Ocean seabirds. In total, 29 seabird species breed on Prince Edward Island while 28 species breed on the larger Marion Island. Together, these islands host nearly half of the global population of Wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans). However, Marion Island’s seabirds face a severe threat: invasive House mice (Mus musculus), accidentally introduced in the 1800s, are pushing the island’s ecosystem, and its seabird populations, towards ecological collapse.\nIn partnership with the South African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, BirdLife South Africa established Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion (MFM) Project in 2021. This project’s objective is the eradication of House mice to restore Marion Island’s biodiversity and ecological integrity. The MFM Project is currently in its planning and preparatory phase, with the expected date of the eradication operation dependent on securing required funding and regulatory approvals well before the operation.\n19 of the 28 seabird species breeding on Marion Island are at risk of local extinction due to the impacts of invasive House mice. Marion Island’s warming and drying climate is creating improved conditions for mice. Having already driven many invertebrate populations to negligible levels, some of which are now at risk of extinction, mice have turned to eating seabird eggs, chicks, and more recently even adult birds. Given projections of ongoing climate change, this threat is likely to intensify.\nThe eradiation of mice to restore Marion Island requires broadcasting of specially-formulated rodenticide bait from spreader buckets slung beneath helicopters guided by GPS technology. Every aspect of the operation—from timing and bait selection to helicopter use, loading techniques, GIS mapping tools, and health and safety procedures—is based on previous operational experience and best practice principles developed from decades of island restoration work worldwide and refined by island-specific trials, and extensive ecological research on Marion Island.\nAround the world, numerous islands have been restored through the eradication of invasive species, particularly introduced predators. The dramatic recoveries of native flora and fauna in these places provide strong evidence that similar interventions can deliver lasting biodiversity gains. For seabirds, removing a major threat not only allows populations to rebound but also strengthens their resilience against other pressures, such as climate-change driven ocean changes and fisheries bycatch. Moreover, this intervention will also help buffer seabird populations against emerging threats, including diseases such as the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. See the PEI NBA report for further details.\n\n\n\n\nGrey-headed albatross chicks on Marion Island. (© Ben Dilley)\n\n\n\n\n\nConducting bait trials on Marion Island.

Albatross Task Force seabird conservation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 18 species of albatrosses that breed in the Southern Ocean, 12 species forage in South African waters, all of which are impacted by fishing activities in the form of bycatch. Five of the 12 species of albatross breed on the Prince Edward Islands, including 40% of the world’s Wandering albatross population. An additional 19 species of seabirds are impacted by bycatch, including 14 that breed in South Africa, of which five are Benguela Current endemics. Of the total 31 species impacted by bycatch, 14 (35%) are threatened with extinction, with an additional 7 species classified as Near threatened by the IUCN.\nAt the forefront of dealing with seabird bycatch issues is BirdLife South Africa’s Albatross Task Force (ATF) team, active since 2004 and part of an international team of experts working directly with fishing crews and governments to implement and legislate seabird bycatch mitigation measures. The ATF has been instrumental in the development and adoption of Bird-scaring Lines (BSLs), a key mitigation measure that significantly reduces seabird interactions with trawl cables and baited hooks. In 2010, research carried out by the ATF demonstrated that the use of BSLs reduced annual seabird bycatch in the demersal hake trawl fishery by 90%, from an estimated 9 300 birds being killed annually (2004-2005) to under 1 000 seabirds in 2010 (Maree et al. 2014).\nAn 85% reduction in seabird bycatch by foreign longline vessels operating in South African waters was achieved through the incorporation of strict management legislation in 2008, reducing the estimated 2 800 birds killed annually between 1998-2005 to an average of 340 birds killed per year between 2006-2013 (Rollinson et al. 2017).\nEnsuring compliance with mitigation is key to sustaining seabird bycatch reductions and in addition to training fisheries observers and monitors, the ATF is actively promoting and partnering in researching electronic monitoring tools such as the Imvelo BSL Tension Device. A simple device that measures the tension exerted by the BSL as it is dragged through the water, providing real-time data and informing compliance with this measure.\nThe National Plan of Action for Seabirds (NPOA-S) for the period 2025-2030 has recently been drafted by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment in collaboration with the ATF. The document once adopted will provide a national framework and strategic actions aimed at further reducing seabird bycatch across South Africa’s fisheries and promote sustainable fishing practices that align with international conservation standards.\nOne of the major threats to the Critically Endangered African penguin is a lack of food, driven by competition with the fishing industry and climate-induced changes in fish distribution and abundance. While there are several initiatives in place to address this, a novel conservation measure is to establish new penguin breeding colonies in areas of higher fish abundance where there is little competition from the fishery. This work is being led by BirdLife South Africa in partnership with CapeNature and SANCCOB. In late 2018, work began on the eastern edge of the De Hoop Nature Reserve. A small colony was established there in the early 2000s but was abandoned by about 2008 due to predation by caracal. A predator-proof fence was installed to protect the headland, which is monitored using CCTV cameras along the fence and trail cameras to determine the general abundance and movements of predators.\nThe first phase of the project was to attract penguins to the site naturally, using social attraction techniques that mimic an already existing colony. Life-like penguin decoys were placed at high vantage points and a speaker playing penguin calls was set up. These were in place for 2 years before the second phase was implemented. This was to release hand-reared penguin fledglings. Abandoned eggs and chicks rescued from other colonies, are hand-reared by SANCCOB before being released back into the wild at the age they would fledge naturally. Since 2021, over 300 fledglings have been released.\n\n\nBird-scaring lines preventing seabird mortalities from cable interactions in use by a demersal trawl vessel.

Since 2021, over 300 fledglings have been released.\nThree wild adult African penguins arrived at the colony in June 2022. It is unknown where these birds were from, but it was too soon for any released birds to be of breeding age (which is 4-6 years). One pair bred at the colony that year. Penguin numbers increased in 2023, with up to 20 moulting at the site and four pairs breeding. The growth of the colony was slowed in 2024, after a honey badger got through the fence and killed 11 penguins, several of which at the time were preparing to nest. However, one pair bred successfully despite this. The fence has since been reinforced, and no further predation has occurred. Two pairs have bred in 2025, successfully raising two chicks each (BirdLife, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Hoop colony headland.

Purse-seine fishery no-take zones around six major African penguin colonies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetition for common anchovy and sardine prey between African Penguins and commercial purse-seine fishers has been recognized as a significant threat to the African Penguin. This threat was suspected as early as the 1970s but it was not until 2008 that formal recognition of this threat was translated into action by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism through the implementation of experimental ‘island closures’ including alternating 3-year open and closed periods around four major penguin colonies in two regions (Dassen and Robben islands on the west coast and St Croix and Bird islands in Algoa Bay) up until 2021. The results of this experiment demonstrated a meaningful effect of these closures to African penguin breeding success, although the experiment was limited in its ability to assess longer-term impacts of fishing closures on other important African Penguin population parameters such as survival. Despite these limitations and after a lengthy period of negotiations between the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, the purse-seine fishing industry representatives and penguin scientists, including an international review of the scientific findings, between 2021 and 2024, no-take zones were implemented for a minimum of 10 years (pending reviews in 2031 and 2035) around six penguin colonies in 2025 (Figure 4 – Figure 6); these included the addition of the south coast colonies of Stony Point and Dyer Island (Figure 5). This resulted in meaningful closure extents, i.e. closure designs that incorporated the majority of important penguin foraging habitat, around at least one colony in each of the three major regions (Figure 4 – Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Of these, 56% (9 species) are threatened with extinction, placing sole responsibility on South Africa to protect and conserve these species (Meyer-Milne et al. in prep).\nThis assessment of Anostraca contributed to 58% of the global Anostraca IUCN assessments, making a sizeable contribution to the understanding of the current state of these temporary freshwater habitat indicator species.\nThe IUCN Red List Index (RLI) assessment revealed that Anostraca have the third lowest RLI score (0.84), making it one of the most threatened taxonomic groups in South Africa. This illustrates the need for further surveys of temporary freshwater systems in the country, to understand their drivers of threat better as well as guide efforts to prevent further losses.\nMajor threats to Anostraca are habitat loss and degradation due to urban and agricultural expansion, and mining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List status over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct. The Red List Index of Anostraca was calculated for the first time for South Africa, and this group is relatively low on the RLI scale, with a value of 0.84. This indicates that the group has high levels of threat and that many species are at risk of extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Pressures\nThe major drivers of threat to Anostraca species are habitat loss and degradation caused by urban and agricultural expansion and mining. Due to the temporary nature of the freshwater systems that Anostraca species inhabit, they seldom exhibit wetland indicators to alert water resource protection. Their soils do not always display typical soil wetness indicators and obligate- or facultative wetland plant species are often absent. In the arid regions of South Africa, the surfaces of many pan systems are bare or rocky, while along the escarpment or other large rock formations, the rock pools go unnoticed when dry. As a result, these habitats and their unique aquatic fauna do not receive adequate recognition to allow for their protection against ongoing pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s Anostraca species, based on the percentage of impacted threatened Anostraca species. Pressures are categorised using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and are ranked from the highest to the lowest percent of impacted species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Speeding events by vehicles pose egg bank destruction – an unusual pressure unique to large pans in the arid regions of South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational speeding in general, as well as speeding events like Pandemonium in the Bushmanland, and official land speed record attempts like Bloodhound on Hakskeenpan in the Kalahari, favour the large, flat, hard and arid basins of pans for speed racing. Vehicle movement on these surfaces disturb the top layer of the crust where the dormant eggs of Anostraca and other aquatic invertebrates are located, eroding their egg banks (Box 4).\nThese large temporary systems fill only every few years, and the highly specialised aquatic invertebrate communities survive dry periods through their resting eggs that are contained in the top few centimetres of the sediment. The eggs are extremely fragile and unable to withstand more than ~1 Newton of force, so they depend on an intact crust for protection. Disturbances to the crust can therefore destroy the egg bank, disrupt the hatching cycle, and threaten the survival of aquatic invertebrates in these habitats.\nSee the article ‘Land speed record’ racecourse threatens rare fairy shrimps at Hakskeenpan for further details.",

To reassess this group in the future and have a better understanding of the state of Anostraca species, monitoring of temporary freshwater species and their habitat conditions is required.

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nMany of the Anostraca species that are of conservation concern are considered under-sampled, as there are only a few experts actively conducting surveys, and the taxonomical skills to accurately identify the specimens to species level are scarce. Furthermore, the life history traits adopted by Anostraca to survive in their temporary habitats create an unpredictable sampling timeframe, which complicates sampling attempts. As a result, many promising potential habitats remain underexplored. Some of the important actions needed to address current knowledge gaps include:\n\nMany areas in South Africa and the subcontinent remain unsampled. Regional surveys specifically for Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Free State and North-West should be prioritised.\nActive search campaigns should be launched for the CR - Possibly Extinct species, Streptocephalus gracilis and Rhinobranchipus martensi, as well as for the Data Deficient species, Branchipodopsis scambus and Streptocephalus vitreus.\nGenetic studies are needed to unravel suspected species complexes, where great morphological variation exist, e.g., Branchipodopsis wolfi and Branchipodopsis tridens.\nDeveloping a standardised method to calculate population estimates for hatching trials, field research, monitoring, and ad-hoc sampling, which is a vital element during red list assessments.\nAttracting interest for branchiopod research and training more South Africans in branchiopod taxonomy skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4: Egg bank sampling is an effective alternative to live sampling in temporary freshwater habitats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnostracan eggs have species-specific morphologies, making them useful indicators of diversity and density in unpredictable habitats when live sampling is not possible6.

A high proportion (38 taxa or 66%) of these face an elevated risk of extinction, thus placing sole responsibility on the country to protect and ensure persistence of these species.\nThe IUCN Red List Index (RLI) indicates that freshwater fishes have the second-lowest RLI score (0.75) compared to other taxonomic groups in South Africa. This shows that freshwater fishes are one of the most threatened groups, consistent with the broader patterns of the vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems in the country.\nThe major threats to freshwater fishes are invasive alien fishes, pollution, over-abstraction of water and habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Density of threatened freshwater fish taxa (10 x 10 km grid) based on distribution records.

    "text": "Threat status\nThe Red List assessment of all freshwater fishes in South Africa was done in 2016/17. A comparison with all comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups in the country indicated that freshwater fishes have the second highest proportion of species that are threatened with extinction (36%), second to sharks, rays and chimaeras Table 1. Overall, more than half (53% or 62 taxa) of freshwater fishes in the country are classified as Taxa of Conservation Concern (ToCC) (Figure 1). Most of these taxa occur in the Cape Fold Ecoregion (CFE)1,3,4. Most concerning is that almost all the endemic freshwater fishes (88% or 51 taxa) in the country are classified as ToCC (Figure 1 & Figure 2).\nThe elevated risk of extinction for freshwater fishes corresponds to the poor condition of rivers. Estimates from the freshwater ecosystem assessment indicate that 75% of overall river length in the country has been modified and over 50% of rivers are threatened. A reassessment of the Red List status for freshwater fishes in the country is planned for 2027 to integrate new information (including new species and distribution records) that has been generated from a number of projects that were undertaken since the previous 2016/17 assessment (see further details in Box 1). As these assessments are underpinned by correct taxonomy, ongoing work is focusing on expediting the resolution of the taxonomic statuses of selected priority groups ahead of the planned 2027 reassessment. Another important development over the last nine years was the establishment of the freshwater fish observation network that was constituted to provide a better coordinated approach to address the challenges that were identified in the NBA 2018.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Taxonomic advances since the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest Red List assessment for freshwater fishes of South Africa was done in 2016/17. These findings were integrated into the National Biodiversity Assessment 2018. Key outcomes of this assessment were the identification of substantial taxonomic gaps across several species, and the lack of ongoing monitoring and uncertainties about species distribution patterns; highlighting the need for targeted research. In response, several research initiatives, primarily led by NRF-SAIAB in collaboration with SANBI and other partners, were launched to advance taxonomic understanding and fill sampling gaps. These include the Topotypes Project (NRF FBIP), the Karoo BioGaps Project (NRF FBIP), the Waterberg Biodiversity Project (NRF FBIP), the Tilapia Mapping Project (DFFE & SANBI), the REFRESH Project (NRF FBIP) and the eDNA Project (WRC) that were initiated to fill the identified taxonomic and species distribution gaps.\nThese projects, some of which are still ongoing, have already yielded significant scientific breakthroughs: 28 new fish species have been formally described, 11 previously synonymised species have been revalidated, and several candidate species requiring further taxonomic investigation have been uncovered across southern Africa1,2,4–7. Major milestones for South African species include comprehensive genetic assessments and taxonomic revisions of the genera Pseudobarbus, Galaxias, Enteromius, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Anoplopterus, Sandelia and Glossogobius, which have collectively increased the number of freshwater fish species in the country from 105 in 2016 to 139 in 20251,8–18. Several additional new species are in the process of being formally described for inclusion into the 2027 reassessment.\nStrategic research initiatives have significantly strengthened the evidence base for conservation planning in South Africa. The REFRESH project addressed critical sampling gaps and updated historical records for inclusion into future Red List assessments. The Waterberg Biodiversity Project expanded species occurrence data in a priority region and highlighted the role of existing terrestrial conservation areas in safeguarding the region’s unique ichthyofauna from escalating anthropogenic pressures19. In parallel, NRF-SAIAB is advancing the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a tool for long-term monitoring of freshwater fishes of conservation and socio-economic importance. However, the reliability of eDNA-based assessments depends on an accurate and resolved taxonomic framework. Continued efforts to address taxonomic uncertainty and uncover undocumented diversity, particularly for the Amatola-Winterberg, Southern Temperate and Zambezian Lowveld freshwater ecoregions of South Africa, remain essential as this has direct implications for future Red List Assessments and the broader conservation agenda.\n\n\n\n\nNRF-SAIAB students Xiluva Mathebula and Nkululeko Zuma using a seine net to collect Enteromius specimens as part of SAIAB’s ongoing freshwater fish research.

    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) of species20. The RLI indices are calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, with the lower value indicating rapid progression towards extinction. A value of 1 signifies that all taxa are Least Concern, whereas a value of 0 indicates that all taxa are extinct. The RLI for freshwater fishes of South Africa was calculated at 0.75, revealing this group to be the second lowest among all assessed taxonomic groups in the country Figure 3. This relatively low (compared with other taxonomic groups) RLI reflects a high proportion of species facing elevated extinction risk, reinforcing the urgent need for targeted interventions to secure remaining populations and promote recovery of species that have suffered severe reductions in distribution ranges and population sizes.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

The freshwater fish component was mainly aimed at filling knowledge gaps and renewing data to support updating management tools such as mapping of the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPAs), feeding into the environmental screening tool, and assessment of threat status following the IUCN Red List criteria. Sampling was done in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, and over 300 species occurrence records and over 165 COI barcodes were generated. The taxonomic statuses of a number of species in the genera Pseudobarbus, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Glossogobius and Enteromius were revised as part of this project, resulting in the description of six new species and revalidation of two species. Several other new species are in the process of being formally described.

    "text": "Pressures\nMajor drivers of threat to freshwater fishes in South Africa (Figure 4) and emerging pressures that are being detected and are not yet considered in IUCN Red List assessments are described below.\n\nExisting pressures\nInvasive alien freshwater fish species\nSouth Africa is one of six global fish invasion hotspots21 and at least 55 freshwater fish species (alien and extralimital) have been introduced into novel environments in South Africa22. While invasive fish mainly affect native fish species through predation and competition, they can also have genetic impacts such as hybridisation and be vectors for the introduction of pathogens and parasites. The group with the most severe impacts in terms of predation is the north American centrarchids (three species of black bass (Micropterus spp.) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Invasive rainbow trout is a common invader in headwater ecosystems due to its preference for cooler water and has invaded headwater habitats mainly in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. This is problematic as many headwater environments, especially those located in protected areas, provide refuge to threatened native fish populations. Many populations of smaller-bodied native species have been extirpated due to predation and competition by invasive alien species, especially in larger mainstream rivers9,23. Alien species also pose a risk to native species from a genetic perspective and an example is the invasive Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which threatens the genetic integrity of the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) through hybridisation. Historically, the main driver for alien fish introductions has been angling, but other significant pathways for invasion have been aquaculture, the ornamental fish trade, inter-basin water transfers, biocontrol and conservation translocations.\nInvasive fish populations are not limited to species originating outside the country as a number of indigenous species have established invasive extralimital populations outside their native ranges. Ill-conceived conservation translocations were historically a driver that led to the establishment of extralimital populations, some of which became invasive. For example, the Clanwilliam yellowfish (Labeobarbus seeberi) is a native cyprinid endemic to the Olifants-Doring system in the CFE, which has been translocated upstream of a natural barrier into the Twee River catchment to create a yellowfish sanctuary. While the yellowfish successfully established, they also had adverse impacts on the Critically Endangered and highly range-restricted Twee River redfin (Sedercypris erubescens). Presently, this redfin has been displaced from most of its native range by the Clanwilliam yellowfish and the Cape kurper (Sandelia capensis), another native CFE species that has an extralimital and invasive presence in the Twee catchment.\nAnother problematic native species is the African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus – LC), which was identified in the previous Red List assessment (2007) as an upcoming potential future threat, and it has spread as predicted24. The native range of this species is the northern ecoregions, and it extends from the Orange River system in the west to the Mtamvuna (KwaZulu-Natal) in the east1. As a result of inter-basin water transfers and human-assisted dispersal, it now has an extensive invasive range in all the major river systems and many smaller coastal catchments of the Western and Eastern Cape25. While it favours large lowland rivers and floodplain habitats,22 have shown that sharptooth catfish can readily invade sensitive headwater habitats. Both their ability to establish in these habitats and their impacts on sensitive headwater ecosystems remain poorly studied25.\nTwo invasive freshwater crayfish species, Cherax quadricarinatus and Procambarus clarkii are present in several river systems in South Africa. Recent records indicate that these species are expanding their ranges in South Africa and other parts of the region without much control. Of particular concern is the recent detection of P. clarkii in the Western Cape Province, a region with the highest concentration of highly threatened freshwater fishes in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s freshwater fishes. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of habitat quality and quantity\nSouth Africa is a water-scarce country with many competing water users. While the National Water Act 36 of 199826 recognises the environment as a legitimate water user, environmental flow requirements and pollution mitigation measures are not consistently implemented or enforced on a national scale. While some species have a higher tolerance for polluted systems such as the African sharptooth catfish and several tilapia species, most other species are intolerant of polluted water, and this is reflected by the increasing incidences of fish kills due to mining effluent and poorly maintained and managed Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTWs).\nPollution in a range of forms (e.g., from agricultural and forestry effluent, domestic and urban wastewater, and industrial effluent) is impacting many freshwater fishes of conservation concern. Many rivers, especially mainstream and lowland reaches are impacted by pollution as 67% of rivers are considered degraded. For example, the Elands River (Inkomti system) flowing past Machadodorp to its confluence with the Crocodile River is polluted due to a paper mill and settlements situated close to the river as well as the poorly-managed WWTW. These sources of pollution are impacting the Incomati suckermouth catfish (Chiloglanis bifurcus – CR)27. The Elands River and its tributaries have been identified as a priority freshwater environment for fish conservation through the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) (Driver et al. 2012; Nel et al. 2011a; 2011b), however this needs updating to reflect the current state of knowledge. The Tradouw redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli – CR) is affected by hydrological modification, agrochemical pollution as well as poorly functioning sewage works that impact the Tradouw River downstream of Barrydale28. The Krom River minnow (Pseudobarbus senticeps – CR), restricted to the Krom River system, has been extirpated from its historic range mainly as a result of invasive alien species, while in the Assegaaibosch River, the population is impacted by excessive pollution from settlements in the sub-catchment8.\nAnthropogenic pollution can be exacerbated by unsustainable water use patterns and over-abstraction of surface water sources. Complete abstraction during the dry season can result in localised extirpations, as was observed for the smallscale redfin (Pseudobarbus asper). This species was historically widespread throughout the Gouritz and Gamtoos river systems in the CFE but presently persist as highly fragmented populations in larger tributaries. Sampling results suggest that it has been lost from mainstream habitat due to the impacts of invasive piscivorous fish, while two lowland river populations downstream of Towerkop Nature Reserve are likely extirpated because of complete abstraction of surface water during the dry summer season. Lowland species such as Pseudobarbus asper are especially vulnerable to water abstraction impacts as there are often no refuge populations in upstream areas from where the species can recolonise. Examples such as these illustrate that impacts on habitat quality and quantity are significant pressures on freshwater fish and drive the highly threatened status of many taxa. Alarmingly, these pressures are only expected to worsen under future climate change predictions, especially for the CFE.\n\n\n\nUpstream and downstream views of the same river downstream of Towerkop Nature Reserve, showing the complete loss of habitat due to water abstraction in summer. While the weir structure (middle image) is relatively small, it diverts all surface flow into a drop-in grate and pipe system that channels the water downstream for irrigation purposes. (© Martine Jordaan)\n\n\n\n\nExacerbated and emerging pressures\nFreshwater systems across the assessment region face an expanding list of severe threats. These include acid mine drainage and mining-related sedimentation and effluent spills, forestry activities such as XXXX, alien invasive fish and their translocation, road-related chemical spills, agricultural impacts such as XXX, alien plant invasions and associated control activities. These impacts are exacerbated by failures in municipal water services, including non-functional sewage works and refuse dumping in sensitive areas of catchments. Illegal gold mining within sensitive riverbeds is a growing concern, directly damaging habitats that support already highly threatened freshwater fish species.\nSee Box X, Freshwater Species Realm.",

Protection level results for the freshwater fishes of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nA protection level assessment was completed for 96 freshwater fish taxa in South Africa. Peripheral taxa with less than 5% of their range in the country were excluded. Freshwater fishes remain the most poorly protected of all assessed taxonomic groups: only 26% (25 taxa) are Well Protected, while the remaining 74% are under-protected – classified as Not Protected (17 taxa), Poorly Protected (33 taxa), or Moderately Protected (21 taxa). Among the endemics alone, 88% (49 taxa) are under-protected, and 68% (38 taxa) of these are threatened with extinction (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable).\nOne improvement since the previous assessment was for the Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseudobarbus verloreni, EN), which shifted from Not Protected to Poorly Protected due to the declaration of a new protected area that now includes one of its subpopulations. However, of the seven Critically Endangered freshwater fish taxa, four – the Treur River barb (Enteromius treurensis), Barrydale redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli), Pseudobarbus senticeps and Galaxias sp. nov. ‘slender’ – are Not Protected. All these four species have extremely restricted ranges, sometimes confined to a single river reach or sub-catchment, and no expansion of protected areas has included their distributions.\nThirty-three taxa are classified as Poorly Protected, with most also assessed as threatened or Near Threatened (25 taxa). Of these, 22 taxa are endemic to South Africa, meaning that the country is solely responsible for protecting these species. The primary reason freshwater fishes remain under-protected is that the existing protected area network seldom includes headwaters, full catchments, or sufficient lengths of rivers to buffer key threats. Moreover, many pressures – such as pollution and water abstraction – originate upstream or outside protected areas and cannot be mitigated from within them. While some pressures, such as invasive alien fishes, can be partially managed in protected areas by installing invasion barriers such as instream weirs, or restricting harmful land-use activities, current protection remains inadequate for most freshwater fishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. An improvement in protection for one amongst many needing increased protection – celebrating the small wins: Pseudobarbus verloreni\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseudobarbus verloreni) (EN) is a recently described range-restricted redfin minnow. It is endemic to the Verlorenvlei catchment in the CFE where it was historically widespread throughout the catchment29. It co-occurs with two additional native taxa, Galaxias zebratus and an undescribed lineage of the Cape kurper, Sandelia sp. ‘capensis West Coast’.\nCurrently, P. verloreni persists as three remnant populations (the Krom Antonies, the upper Kruismans and the lower Verlorenvlei River). Of these, the Krom Antonies River population appears to be the only one that is viable in the long term as the riparian zone and water quality in the Krom Antonies River sub-catchment is relatively undisturbed. The viability of the other two subpopulations is uncertain due to their small size and pressures elsewhere in the catchment. The lower Verlorenvlei River is polluted and heavily invaded by invasive species including largemouth bass (Micropterus nigricans), banded tilapia (Tilapia sparrmanii) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Water abstraction throughout the catchment is also a significant threat that affects long term persistence of isolated pools which provide refugia for all three native species in the intermittent Verlorenvlei system during the dry season30.\nIn a recent evaluation of the value of protected areas for conserving the freshwater fishes of the CFE,31 P. verloreni was one of 19% of species that were assessed that did not intersect with any form of protected area. This, together with the severity of the threats facing the species, made the long-term survival of P. verloreni uncertain. The situation has however improved with the recent declaration of the Moutonshoek Protected Environment. This formal protected area intersects the upper Krom Antonies River and protects the headwaters of this river where P. verloreni is known to be present as a viable subpopulation. The declaration of the protected area also mitigates against proposed tungsten mining activity in the upper catchment. Threats such as water abstraction will be addressed as part of the management plan for the protected area, and the risk of alien fish invasion is being mitigated by the proposed construction of an instream invasion barrier in the lower Krom Antonies River. This forms part of the Krom Antonies Restoration Project, led by the Freshwater Research Centre (FRC).\nPseudobarbus verloreni (Verlorenvlei redfin) specimen. (© Albert Chakona)",

    "text": "Monitoring\nFreshwater fish monitoring is mandated across provinces and is generally embedded within protected area management plans under provincial agencies. However, specialised capacity within these agencies has declined, with many taxon-specific posts replaced by generalist roles. There is also generally a strong focus on larger charismatic mammal species as many of these are subject to commercial utilisation. Although monitoring plans exist, not all provinces have the expertise or resources to implement them fully across all taxonomic groups. Additional monitoring is undertaken by universities, NGOs and short-term projects, but no institution is dedicated to long-term freshwater fish monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Provincial monitoring efforts - Western Cape - CapeNature\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Western Cape Province has an extensive protected area (PA) network. Each provincial reserve or reserve complex has a protected area management plan (PAMP), which sets out the conservation targets and associated monitoring requirements for the PA. Most PAMPS have freshwater fishes and freshwater ecosystems as conservation targets and these are monitored on a three-year cycle to determine the status of freshwater fish species communities, identify changes in threats and inform adaptive management. Data from these monitoring events serves to inform conservation actions and decision support, and provide the basis for threat assessments and protection level analysis. A significant shortcoming is that many priority freshwater fish species or populations do not occur within the boundaries of PAs and are thus overlooked. This gap is often filled by conservation NGOs that partner with provincial conservation agencies to fill monitoring and surveillance gaps in the landscape. Western Cape examples are the Grootvadersbos Conservancy Trust and the Nuwejaars Conservancy, where both conservancies are currently focusing their efforts on the threatened Pseudobarbus redfin species and implementing monitoring and species recovery actions. In addition, the Freshwater Research Centre is implementing several species recovery projects aimed at CR and EN species in the southwestern Cape Fold Ecoregion.\n\n\n\n\nCapeNature staff Dr Martine Jordaan and Khayakazi Breakfast conducting a fish survey in Bokkeriver Nature Reserve.

(© Martine Jordaan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reduction in specialist capacity has led to a heavy reliance on external partners, whose expertise and continuity vary. Structured, continuous monitoring is essential, and its absence has already affected key initiatives: (1) conservation translocations of Enteromius treurensis into upstream reaches have been discontinued27; (2) taxa such as Kneria sp. nov. ‘South Africa’ (EN) remain undescribed and the Enteromius anoplus (LC) species complex remains taxonomically unresolved, thus limiting effective assessment; and (3) sporadic project-based surveys suggest that some threatened taxa are persisting, but in the absence of structured monitoring, population trends remain unknown.\nThe River Eco-status Monitoring Programme (REMP) has replaced the South African River Health Programme (RHP), but its purpose is to assess river ecological condition by integrating abiotic drivers (hydrology, geomorphology, water quality) and biotic responses (fish, invertebrates, riparian vegetation) relative to reference or baseline conditions. It informs ecological categories, compliance with Resource Quality Objectives and early-warning thresholds. Where implemented, REMP provides assemblage-level rather than species-specific fish data. In many provinces, the programme has been curtailed due to funding constraints. For example, Mpumalanga Province once had three aquatic scientists but now has only one, making monitoring of freshwater fishes extremely challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. Rehabilitation actions supporting monitoring and skills transfer\n\n\n\n\n\nA monitoring and rehabilitation program is underway in the Olifants and Wilger Rivers, Mpumalanga Province, through a partnership between the Mpumalanage Tourism and Parks Agency and Thungela Coal Mining. The project was initiated in response to an acid mine drainage spill event in the Upper Saalboom River that killed all fish species along 98 km of river, down to the Loskop Dam inlet. A breeding facility has been established at Loskop Dam Nature Reserve (Thugela Fish breeding facility), in response to the spill. This facility focuses on breeding nine indigenous fish species for reintroduction into the Wilger River. This initiative has been running since 2022, with reintroductions ongoing and intensive biomonitoring being conducted to assess recovery. In addition to restocking, the project supports capacity building through knowledge transfer between experienced (including retired) staff and interns involved in the programme.\n\n\n\nAreas requiring monitoring:\n\nHistorical occurrence sites: re-survey locations where the species was previously recorded (some as far back as the early 1980s) to confirm whether populations persist.\nHabitat condition: collect standardised data on habitat quality to inform Red List assessments and quantify extinction risk.\nSampling gaps: target under-sampled regions, particularly the Eastern Cape Province, where monitoring effort has been minimal.\nGenetic sampling: collect subpopulation-level DNA samples to support BioBanking and long-term conservation planning.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nAlthough some progress has been made, considerable knowledge gaps still exist for a number of freshwater fishes from the Southern Temperate and Zambezian Lowveld ecoregions in the north-eastern sections of the country. Ongoing work is focusing on addressing taxonomic challenges for species in the genera Labeobarbus, Enteromius, Clarias, Kneria, Opsaridium, Anoplopterus, Ctenopoma and Microctenopoma.\nA better understanding of the biological and ecological requirements of newly described taxa is also needed. In many cases, ecological studies were completed before taxonomic revisions, and it is unclear whether all taxa within a former species complex share the same ecological and life-history characteristics. Examples are species such as the Pseudobarbus burchelli complex that has been shown to comprise four distinct species with allopatric distributions. Similarly for the P. afer, G.zebratus and E. anoplus complexes.\nAlthough rehabilitation needs for highly threatened species are often known by taxon experts, they are rarely formalised into species conservation or action plans. Without such plans, local implementation is difficult and opportunities to secure external funding are often lost. See freshwater fishes recovery action that might address this knowledge gap in the future.",

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\n\nRed List Assessment\nThe IUCN Red List criteria and categories are used to assess the threat status of species. Freshwater fish species were assessed in 2016, utilising multiple workshops, including a three-day in-person workshop hosted by the South African Institute of Aquatic Biodiversity (NRF-SAIAB) in Makhanda, Eastern Cape, and funded by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). All available spatial data were collated, and experts reviewed specimen records related to these data. Incorrect data were georeferenced, with a high investment in updating all threatened species records. The freshwater fish checklist was based on a very specific definition of freshwater fishes and included species occurring in neighbouring countries Eswatini and Lesotho. See further details from a study on diversity, distribution and extinction risk of native freshwater fishes of South Africa4.\n\n\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a persistence target for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends on the area protected and on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicator has been applied to terrestrial and freshwater species in six taxonomic groups, including a representative sample of 900 plant taxa. Peripheral taxa with &lt;5% of their range in South Africa were excluded. Protection levels have been calculated for 2 449 taxa in total.\nHow the Indicator is calculated\nThe indicator has two components:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas - quantifies how much of a species’ distribution or viable population units fall within protected areas. This guides the prioritisation of species for protected area expansion.\nProtected area effectiveness - adjusts for how well pressures such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes or damaging land use are controlled. Not all protected areas contribute equally to species persistence.\n\nSpecies-specific conservation targets reflect either the area required to support a minimum viable population, or for freshwater fishes, the presence of at least ten viable subpopulations.\nScores for protected area effectiveness were developed with input from freshwater fish experts and protected area management agencies, based on species responses to management at specific sites.\nFreshwater Fish Reassessment (2025)\nThe 2025 reassessment repeated the previous method using the 2018 protection level as the baseline, with minor spatial data updates from a 2022 workshop. Updated protected area boundaries meant the 2018 protection level assessment had to be recalculated with re-applied expert scores. No taxonomic changes were included in this cycle. A full update incorporating revised taxonomy and new Red List assessments is planned for 2027. Although this interim update has limitations, experts confirm that the findings align with current field observations. A technical report outlining the full methodology and limitations will follow.",

By 2023, Africa’s black rhino population had increased to 6 448 individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n© James Warwick\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLion (Panthera leo)\n\n\n\nLions (Panthera leo) present a contrasting picture. Although listed as Vulnerable globally, South Africa’s population is classified as Least Concern nationally, with an estimated 2 007 mature individuals showing stable to increasing trends. These populations are largely managed within smaller fenced reserves functioning as a metapopulation network that supports demographic and genetic viability.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Elsa Bussiere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeopard (Panthera pardus)\n\n\n\nLeopards (Panthera pardus) remain Vulnerable both nationally and globally, affected by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, retaliatory killings, and poaching for traditional medicine and cultural uses, despite their continued wide distribution across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Andrei Snyman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare antelope species\n\nAmong South Africa’s rare antelope species, both the roan (Hippotragus equinus) and sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) are classified as Vulnerable on the national Red List, although both are listed as Least Concern globally. These species naturally occur at low densities within southern Africa, and South Africa represents a key stronghold for their continued persistence.\nBoth species are vulnerable to habitat degradation, competition with other herbivores, predation pressure, and ecological management challenges, including artificial water provisioning and overstocking.\nApproximately 77% of South Africa’s roan antelope and substantial numbers of sable antelope occur on private land. Recent assessments using the wildness framework (Child et al., 2019) indicate that about half of private roan and 40% of private sable populations retain wild characteristics, contributing meaningfully to national conservation outcomes.\n\nRoan antelope (Hippotragus equinus)\n\n\n\nCurrent estimates indicate approximately 860 wild roan antelope within their natural distribution range, of which only 197 occur in state-owned protected areas, a 43% decline over three generations. While there are many more roan in South Africa, our assessments only include animals that meet the wildness framework criteria (Child et. al. 2019) since intensively managed animals would not survive without continuous human intervention and hence cannot be considered part of South Africa’s wild population. Roan antelope experienced a 90% decline in the Kruger National Park between 1986 and 1993, however numbers have since stabilised. One of the primary causes of decline was the addition of artificial waterholes within the range of roan in Kruger National Park, which attracted other large grazers such as zebra and wildebeest and subsequent increases in predator numbers in the north of the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Charles Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSable antelope (Hippotragus niger)\n\n\n\nSable antelope populations show similar patterns, with about 1 107 wild individuals nationally and declines in most state-owned reserves, except in Kruger National Park and Loskop Dam Nature Reserve, where populations have increased by 441% over three generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Charles Hall"

    "text": "The contribution of the wildlife economy to biodiversity conservation\nAgainst this backdrop, the wildlife sector has emerged as a cornerstone of conservation success in South Africa, contributing significantly to both species recovery and habitat restoration. Through the expansion of reserves, conservancies, and wildlife ranches, large tracts of former agricultural land have been restored to functional ecosystems, supporting viable populations of charismatic and threatened species such as roan and sable antelope, rhinoceroses, and elephants. For several of these species, private landholders now manage the majority of national populations.\nThe expansion of privately and communally managed conservation areas has also been instrumental in securing and reconnecting habitat for many of the country’s wildlife species. Over half (53.2%) of South Africa’s white rhinoceroses are now held in private ownership, illustrating the important contribution of private custodians to the species’ recovery and persistence (’t Sas Rolfes et al. 2022). Many of these reserves depend on hunting, and the hunting industry has therefore provided an incentive for recovery of rhinos. Poaching of rhinos for their horn threatens to undermine this species’ recovery since many landowners cannot afford the security costs and are starting to disinvest in rhinos (Clements et al., 2023).\nAdditional challenges remain in the management of wildlife populations, particularly where intensive management and selective breeding practices are employed. Such approaches may reduce genetic diversity, alter natural evolutionary trajectories, or shift management priorities from conservation outcomes toward commercial production. The selective breeding of ungulates for specific morphological traits, such as exaggerated horn structures or colour variants (Selier et al., 2018), and the captive breeding of lions have been widely debated for their conservation relevance and animal welfare implications.\nWhile some authors contend that captive-bred lions can serve as a buffer to pressures on wild lion populations by supplying the demand for trophy hunting and derived products (Lindsey et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2015; Williams & ’t Sas Rolfes, 2019), others argue that the conservation contribution of captive lions is minimal or negligible (Coals et al., 2019; Coals et al., 2020; Elwin et al., 2024). Concerns regarding welfare, ecological integrity, and reputational risks have contributed to a shift in policy direction. In 2024, the South African government adopted a policy position to phase out the captive keeping and breeding of lions, as outlined in the Policy Position for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Elephant, Lion, Leopard and Rhinoceros (DFFE, 2024).\nLooking forward, certification schemes and incentive-based mechanisms could strengthen the positive impact of the wildlife sector by rewarding best practices, promoting transparency, and encouraging management that aligns with national biodiversity goals. By fostering stewardship and accountability, these approaches can ensure that managed populations remain genetically robust, ecologically functional, and as wild as possible.\nOverall, the wildlife sector stands as one of South Africa’s great conservation success stories demonstrating that when biodiversity and livelihoods are effectively linked, conservation and economic sustainability can go hand in hand.\n\nRecommended citation\nRaimondo, D.C., Selier, J., Pfab, M., Van Der Colff, D., Monyeki, M.S., & Hendricks, S.E. 2025.

    "text": "Threat status\nSouth Africa’s most recent red list update indicates that of the 336 mammals that occur in the country, 67 are threatened with extinction. Threatened mammals are concentrated mainly in the moist eastern section of South Africa, the area that has seen the highest rates of habitat loss (Figure 1). Almost 20% of mammal species fall within a threatened category (VU, EN or CR), 12% of species are Near Threatened, while close to 70% are Least Concern (Figure 2). It is concerning that around 7% of mammals are listed as Data Deficient, with not enough information available to assign a Red List category. Overall, there were 14 genuine changes threat status in this revision. Eleven species were uplisted to a higher threat category, while only three were downlisted. South Africa’s larger wildlife species face varying levels of threat, with national conservation statuses ranging from Least Concern to Endangered (See page on status of selected wildlife species in South Africa).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using a global standard indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) of species1. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List status over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1. At a value of 1, all species are at low risk of extinction (Least Concern), while a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct. The Red List Index of mammals was calculated for all mammal taxa that have been reassessed (n = 336). The Mammal RLI shows a declining trend from 2016, meaning that species are moving closer to extinction (Figure 3). Further, the mammal RLI is below the national average RLI, meaning mammals are doing worse then the average taxonomic group in South Africa. This is due to eleven species being uplisted to higher categories of threat (Table 2). Fortunately, there are three species that showed improvement in their threat status Box 1.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

With the exception of the aardvark (Orycteropus afer), all the other mammals experiencing increases in threats are small mammals that are declining due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation as well as due to the construction of renewable energy infrastructure (Table 2). Five of the eleven threatened species are bats (Table 2), whose most severe threat is population decline due to mortalities caused by collisions with wind turbines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Improvement in threat status of three species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Cliff and Suretha Dorse\n\n\n\nHartmann’s mountain zebra was downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened\n\n\n\nHartmann’s mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae) naturally occurs in the north-west portions of the Northern Cape Province in South Africa, where they are currently established in three conservation areas: Richtersveld National Park, Augrabies Falls National Park, and Goegap Provincial Nature Reserve. The subspecies has also been introduced outside of their natural distribution range in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, North West, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The subspecies has been downlisted from Vulnerable D1 to Near Threatened D1 due to a genuine increase in population numbers, with the current mature population within the natural distribution range estimated at least 1 230 mature individuals (compared to fewer than 1 000 estimated in 2016), exceeding the threshold for the Vulnerable D1 criterion. This population growth is evident in formally protected areas such as Goegap Nature Reserve, which more than tripled from 25 individuals in 2004 to 83 in 2022; and Augrabies Falls National Park, which increased from 8 individuals in 1996 to 208 in 2016. Private subpopulations in the Northern Cape are also contributing significantly with an estimated 960 to 1 425 wild individuals. The population size remains small and reliant on active management to remain viable, with increasing drought frequencies due to climate change posing an ongoing threat that requires continued management interventions.\n\n\n\n\n© Cliff and Suretha Dorse\n\n\n\nThe roan antelope has been downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable.\n\n\n\nThe roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) naturally occurs in the Limpopo (and marginally in Mpumalanga) bushveld areas through to open savannahs in certain areas of North West, Northern Cape and Free State provinces within South Africa. The species has been downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable because the minimum confirmed wild mature population within the natural range has increased from less than 250 individuals to less than 1 000 individuals (currently estimated at 516-602 mature individuals from a total of 860 individuals). This improvement is primarily due the role that privately owned game farms are playing, as 77% of the total estimated population occurs on private land. While the overall population estimate has increased, roan antelope numbers in state-owned protected areas have declined from 333 individuals across nine protected areas in 2016 to just 197 individuals in eight protected areas in 2024. This decline is primarily attributed to poor habitat management due to insufficient resources (such as funding and human capacity), combined with ecological factors including habitat degradation from high densities of competing herbivores like elephants and other large mammals, increased predation pressure, and the species’ sensitivity to changes in grass height and composition (essential for both foraging and concealing their young).\n\n\n\n\n© Nico de Bruyn\n\n\n\nThe southern elephant seal has been downlisted from Near Threatened to Least Concern.\n\n\n\nThe southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) breeds exclusively on Marion Island and Prince Edward Island within South Africa’s assessment region, with vagrant individuals occasionally spotted along the South African coastline. The species was downlisted from Near Threatened to Least Concern because the Marion Island population has shown sustained recovery since the mid-1990s, with pup production increasing by 47% between 1997 and 2023 (from 421 to 972 pups). Over the past four generations (1986-2023), the population has increased by approximately 29%, demonstrating a positive trajectory after decades of decline. The current mature population at Marion Island is estimated at 3 062 individuals, with the total Prince Edward Islands archipelago population likely reaching 5 500 individuals when including Prince Edward Island and non-breeding females. No serious threats have been affecting these land breeding colonies in the last 40 years and, with this continued positive trend and an absence of major pressures that could cause rapid population decline, the species now qualifies for a Least Concern listing.",

    "text": "Pressures\nMost mammals are threatened by habitat loss from agriculture, which impacts more than 70 species and includes annual and perennial non-timber crops, wood and pulp plantations, and livestock farming. The second most severe pressure is projected population declines linked to climate change and extreme weather. Climate change impacts, particularly prolonged droughts in the Northern Cape, have been especially severe and are causing severe declines to small mammals (see Box 2 for the example of the dramatic decline to the Namaqua dune mole-rat). Mining has also contributed to habitat loss, while renewable energy development is resulting in population declines for a number of bat species (Table 2). Illegal harvesting and trapping of wild animals (biological resource use Figure 5) remains a major concern, particularly in areas with high human densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s mammals, based on the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme (IUCN, 2025).

The Namaqua dune mole-rat, heading towards extinction at a rapid rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Namaqua dune mole-rat (Bathyergus janetta) that occurs in northern namaqualand and southern Namibia has been uplisted from Least Concerned to Endangered. Climate change and habitat destruction are the two major drivers of population reduction. Climate change is already affecting the species by the reduced rainfall causing geophytes (the underground storage organs on which the mole-rats feed) to dry out and disappear, which has reduced population densities to as low as 2 individuals/km² in some areas. Additional threats include habitat loss from diamond mining along coastal regions of southern Namibia and north-western South Africa, and severe overgrazing by small livestock (goats and sheep) in parts of Namaqualand, which degrades the vegetation quality. Recent surveys have revealed local extinctions at Alexander Bay and Port Nolloth, with only three of five known subpopulations remaining in South Africa. The species’ limited dispersal ability means that even if mined areas are rehabilitated, recolonisation may not be possible, and the isolated nature of remaining subpopulations prevents any natural dispersal between them, making the species particularly vulnerable to extinction within the next 100 years.",

(© Gus Mills)\n\n\n\nThe Endangered Wildlife Trust’s Cheetah Range Expansion Project aims to increase cheetah numbers, reduce cheetah-human conflict and create genetically diverse cheetah populations while protecting the demographic integrity of these populations. This project was launched in 2011 (then known as the Cheetah Metapopulation Project) and, since 2017, has expanded its focus to include other southern African countries. The cheetah metapopulation in southern Africa currently stands at 315 mature adults and sub-adults in 67 reserves (Brown et al. 2024) and it is expected that it would have been far lower if it weren’t for the work undertaken since 2011. In 2022, a Cheetah Advisory Group was established with stakeholders to promote science-based, legislative and conservation-focused cheetah management. A biodiversity management plan (BMP) for cheetahs is being drafted, which aims to ensure the long-term survival of the species in the wild.

    "section": "Knowledge gaps",
    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nThe most important gap in monitoring the threat and protection status of mammals is insufficient population sampling and monitoring within protected areas, particularly for small mammal species. Since 2016, several taxonomic orders, especially small mammals, have received inadequate research attention, resulting in limited peer-reviewed studies on population size, trends, and genetic diversity.\nIn the 2025 Mammal Red List Revision, 24 species (7% of all assessed species) were classified as Data Deficient due to insufficient information to assign a Red List category. This represents a significant research priority, with cetaceans comprising the majority of Data Deficient species. All Data Deficient species require urgent baseline surveys and monitoring programs.\nWhile evidence for climate change impacts was reviewed for all assessments, there is very little research or population monitor data to show the impact of climate change on most mammal species. Targeted research on climate vulnerability is needed across all mammal orders to inform proactive conservation strategies and adaptive management interventions.\nAlthough genetic indicators were evaluated for this assessment, analyses were constrained by limited available data. Comprehensive population genetic studies are essential to strengthen these indicators and inform metapopulation management plans.\nPrioritising these research gaps will enhance evidence-based conservation decision-making for South Africa’s mammal diversity.",

    "text": "Approach\n\nThreat Status Assessment\nIn this regional 2025 assessment of South Africa Eswatini and Lesotho, 336 mammal taxa were assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species categories and criteria and applying the regional adjustment criteria. Assessments were undertaken between 2023 and 2025 and involved data contributors from over 40 institutions and 164 experts. A section on genetic health (Box 4) and climate change vulnerability was included for the first time. Evidence for vulnerability to climate change was established from expert observations and literature for all species, and climate modeling was undertaken for 14 species identified as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the 2016 assessment (Box 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Using the National Red List assessment process to inform the genetic health of South Africa’s mammals\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on national efforts to evaluate the genetic health of South Africa’s species (see genetic diversity page), a new project is quantifying the genetic status of all South African mammals using two Global Biodiversity Framework indicators: the Proportion of Populations Maintained and the Proportion of Populations with an Effective Population Size (Ne) above 500. Leveraging the coordination and expertise of the mammal Red List reassessments, assessors systematically compiled recent molecular evidence, identified genetic subpopulations, estimated Ne for each, and highlighted research priorities where information was lacking. A core component of this work was in standardising the use of genetic subpopulations, which were defined as groups of individuals with limited or no gene flow per generation, while metapopulations were recognised where connectivity exceeded one migrant per generation. Contemporary Ne estimates were derived from genetic studies or inferred from proxy data (e.g., census counts [Nc], density and area of occupancy) using Ne/Nc ratios of 0.1–0.3, adjusted for transboundary populations. This represents the first application of genetic indicators across a complete taxonomic group in South Africa, establishing a streamlined framework to inform species conservation status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. Use of climate modelling in assessments\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change modelling was included for the first time in the 2025 Mammal Red List assessment. The approach was piloted for fourteen mammal species that had vulnerability to climate change listed as a potential pressure in the 2016 Red List assessment. Species occurrence records collected from multiple sources, including provincial conservation bodies, museum archives and citizen science platforms, were cleaned and spatially thinned to reduce sampling bias and autocorrelation. Environmental and climatic predictor variables were selected based on species’ ecology and assessed for multicollinearity before model fitting. Three Global Climate Models from CMIP6 (GFDL-ESM4, UKESM1-0-LL, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR) were selected. Two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways were modeled: SSP126 representing a sustainable development scenario with warming limited to 2°C, and SSP585 representing a business-as-usual scenario with mean warming exceeding 4°C. Future distributions were compared to current distributions to calculate habitat maintained, lost, and gained (see (Figure 7) for an example of the spatial modules produced for the Black-footed cat). Of the 14 species assessed, the most dramatic losses in predicted future habitat distribution were for black-footed cat, riverine rabbit, vlei rat, and Verreaux’s mouse while the Bush-tailed hairy-footed gerbil is predicted to gain the most habitat (Table 4). Interestingly, the one species whose population has been observed to experience dramatic declines due to drought in the past 10 years, the Namaqua dune mole-rat (Box 3), was not predicted to lose extensive habitat via climate models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Most species were modeled for 2011-2040, except Bontebok and Cape Mountain Zebra which were modeled for 2041-2070 based on their generation times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. An example of the models produced: predicted changes in distribution for Felis nigripes (black-footed cat) under the three Global Climate Models and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways for the time period 2011-2040.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Red List assessment was conducted in two phases. The first phase concentrated on networking with experts and organisations to obtain recent mammal data. Four introductory workshops were held in 2023 where species experts were introduced to the project and recruited to either assess or review assessments. A call to all research institutions, conservation agencies and experts was circulated to obtain occurrence records, population count data and literature datasets to update the already extensive database established for the 2016 Mammal Red List, and updating of these data continued between 2023 and 2025. Data contributors included museums, university researchers, statutory conservation agencies, environmental consultancies, private protected areas, landowners, and citizen scientists. Overall, the database grew from around 500 000 occurrence records to over 7 000 000. Cleaning and synthesising these data are an ongoing task undertaken by the staff of the Endangered Wildlife Trust. The second phase involved the assessments where experts contributed to updating all of the 2016 assessments with new information on population status, threats, genetics and climate change vulnerability. Assessments were undertaken continuously between 2023-2025, with the review process running in parallel between 2024 and 2025.\n\n\nProtection level assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a persistence target for each species – the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends on the area protected and on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection level categories\nPercentage of biodiversity target\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected\n≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected\n50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected\n5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected\n&lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assessment was applied to 268 mammal species with the persistence targets set either at the area required to protect 10 000 individuals or at a minimum viable population with standardised MVP estimates obtained from meta-analyses undertaken by Hilbers et al. (2017).\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas – quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target is within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness – adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines (such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes, etc.) are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major pressures;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major pressures on species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major pressures on the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.\nThe above analysis was first undertaken for NBA 2018 and was repeated in 2025 using updated species occurrence data based on the 2025 Mammal Red List Reassessment. A spatial layer of protected areas for 2018 and 2025 representing protected areas that were declared at that time were used for the two time periods. Protection levels were also adjusted based on the management effectiveness of protected areas. A technical report outlining the full methodology and limitations will be available in early 2026.",

For a full reflection on entire taxonomic groups, please click on the headings to access the subsections of the website under Species findings.\n\nBirds\nOf the 673 assessed terrestrial bird taxa, 10% are threatened with extinction, while 25% of South Africa’s 20 endemic terrestrial bird species face extinction risk. The main pressures driving threat status changes include agriculture (impacting 67% of threatened taxa), natural system modifications (61%), and biological resource use (45%), with habitat loss from croplands, plantations, and livestock farming being particularly severe. Species like Botha’s lark (Spizocorys fringillaris) face pressure from the conversion of grasslands for agriculture.\n\n\nMammals\nA total of 20% of the 291 assessed terrestrial mammal taxa are threatened with extinction, with 42% of South Africa’s 28 endemic mammals facing this risk. The main pressures are habitat loss and degradation from agricultural and urban expansion (impacting 79% of threatened mammal taxa), climate change and extreme weather conditions (particularly prolonged droughts causing severe declines in small mammals), and overexploitation and poaching. Renewable energy development is also emerging as a substantial pressure, particularly affecting bat populations.\n\n\nReptiles\nAll reptiles are grouped in the terrestrial realm, with those dependent on freshwater habitats also discussed in the freshwater realm. The proportion of reptiles threatened with extinction has increased from 5% in 2018 to 8% in 2022. There are 407 reptile taxa in South Africa of which 155 are endemic. A total of 12% of endemic taxa are threatened. Declines are mainly due to habitat loss associated with agriculture (impacting 80% of threatened taxa), followed by residential and commercial development (46%). Species that have become more threatened since 2018 are facing escalating pressures from illegal wildlife trade and mining.\n\n\nAmphibians\nOf the 135 assessed terrestrial amphibian taxa, 21% are threatened with extinction, with 35% of South Africa’s 26 endemic terrestrial amphibians facing this risk. The main pressures driving threat status changes are invasive and other problematic species (affecting 76% of threatened taxa assessed through diseases, habitat replacement by invasive alien plants, and wetland degradation), followed by natural system modification (64%) related to wetland drainage, and inappropriate fire cycles. Habitat loss and degradation from agricultural activities (57%) is also a significant pressure, and climate change is becoming an increasingly important driver, although the impacts are challenging to quantify.\n\n\nPlants\nIn the representative sample of 900 plant taxa, 17% are threatened with extinction and one in five endemic taxa face extinction risk. Agriculture continues to affect the largest proportion of threatened taxa (68%), while invasive alien species (57%), illegal harvesting (28%), mining-related habitat loss (13%), and drought-related mortality attributed to climate change (11%) are significant pressures. Since 2020 326 plant species have been uplisted to higher categories of threat, 153 of these (53%) have been uplisted due to the impacts of climate change and drought in the north western parts of South Africa, with 124 of these simultaneously impacted by livestock overgrazing (38%). A total of 118 plant taxa (36%) were uplisted due to the impacts of illegal collection for the ornamental trade.\n\n\nSpiders\nSouth Africa is the first country to have undertaken a comprehensive assessment for spiders. This first assessment indicates very low levels of threat with only four percent of the 2 214 assessed spider taxa threatened with extinction. When compared to assessments for plants (where 17% of assessed taxa are threatened) and vertebrates (where 12% of taxa are threatened), on first examination spiders may appear to be more resilient than other groups. There are, however, high levels of data deficiency with 37% of assessed spider taxa lacking sufficient taxonomic resolution and ecological data to assign a category. The overall threat level for spiders will therefore only be known once these data deficiencies are addressed. The major threats to spiders are residential and commercial development (impacting 69% of threatened taxa) followed by agriculture, particularly crop cultivation, which impacts 62% of threatened species. Ground-dwelling species with poor dispersal abilities are particularly impacted by habitat loss.\n\n\nButterflies\nA total of 10% of the 800 butterfly taxa assessed are threatened with extinction, while 18% of South Africa’s 419 endemic terrestrial butterfly taxa face extinction risk. While butterflies were last comprehensively assessed in 2017, the leading causes of decline remain natural ecosystem modification (66%) due to inappropriate fire management and the spread of invasive alien plants, followed by loss of habitat to agriculture (60%). Monitoring by members of the Lepidoptera Society between 2017 and 2025 have shown that two species are no longer extant at formerly known populations. The Waterberg copper butterfly (Erikssonia edgei) and the Brenton blue butterfly (Orachrysops niobe) are considered possibly extinct. The Waterberg copper has been lost from its former sites due to lack of burning of its grassland habitat and the Brenton blue butterfly was lost from its only known site due to unprecedented hot fires caused by alien fuel loads during the 2017 Knysna fires. These possible extinctions are of high concern given South Africa’s commitment to halt extinctions through our ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Key pressures on South Africa’s threatened terrestrial species.

    "text": "Trends – the Red List Index\nThe trend in terrestrial species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI)1. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in taxa assignments to Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, where if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The slope of the line indicates how fast the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction.\nThe RLI is calculated only for comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups or groups where a representative sample has been selected. Changes in status over time has been tracked for six taxonomic groups that occur in the terrestrial realm (Figure 3). Increases in extinction risk is evident for most groups, but a marked increase in rate of extinction since the last assessment is evident from the change in slope of declines for reptiles, birds, mammals and plants. Increases in threat status for birds has largely been because of increasing levels of pollution and other forms of habitat degradation, while the main drivers of declines for mammals, plants and reptiles have been climate change and loss of habitat for mining and renewable energy development (the taxa that have changed status and the reason causing the uplisting to high threat categories are included on each taxon page). Most of the declines to plants are taking place in the Northern Cape Province (Figure 4) with the Namaqualand region most severely impacted. Anthropogenic impacts from livestock farming, mining, and road construction are being amplified by climate change factors including an unprecedented nine-year drought (2011-2019), increased temperatures, and stronger winds that cause cascading desertification processes through soil erosion and sand burial2. This same region is being heavily impacted by illegal wildlife trade of ornamental succulent and geophytic plants. Animals that have increased in threat status are spread across South Africa but are concentrated in the areas with high rates of recent habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for terrestrial species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and a random sample of 900 plants. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the closer the group of species is towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). While spiders have not had repeat assessments yet, a single point for the RLI has been generated to show the relatively low level of threat for this group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

    "text": "Marine ecosystem types\nThe 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment used the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map (Figure 1) to assess the state of 163 marine ecosystem types around mainland South Africa. See the subantarctic territory page for an overview of the marine ecosystem types in the Prince Edward Islands. South Africa’s mainland maritime domain (territorial seas plus Exclusive Economic Zone) extends from the dune base to 200 NM seaward, representing an area of approximately 1.07 million km2 and extending to a depth of about 5 500 m. The continental shelf width varies between ~2 and 260 km, and the shelf break depth ranges between 80 and 600 m, being terraced in places (de Wet and Compton, 2021). The Agulhas Bank is a 116 000 km2 triangular extension of the continental shelf that supports many endemic species. Shelf areas constitute approximately 40% of the mainland maritime domain with slope and abyssal ecosystems constituting the remaining 60%. South Africa has a coastline length of over 3 000 km. A separate coastal chapter covers the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Overview of South Africa’s 2023 hierarchical marine ecosystem classification with four bathomes (inner ring), 17 ecosystem functional groups (central ring), 58 biogeographic ecotypes (segments in outer ring) and 163 national marine ecosystem types (not shown as a distinct ring). The number and relative width of each segment in the outer ring reflects the number of marine ecosystem types nested within each of the biogeographic ecotypes. Where there is no number, there is only one ecosystem type associated with that biogeographic ecotype. Note that the shore and shelf do not separate into benthic and pelagic components but the deepsea includes overlapping benthic and pelagic layers. Adapted from Sink et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nThe 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map includes 128 shore and shelf ecosystem types which are considered benthopelagic, with 22 deepsea benthic and 13 deepsea pelagic ecosystem types (Figure 2). These 163 ecosystem types nest within 17 ecosystem functional groups (Figure 2) that align with those of the IUCN GET, except for minor differences in terminology, and South Africa included Bays as a distinct group. The ecosystem functional groups are nested within bathomes, which represent geomorphological depth categories equivalent to ‘biomes’ in the IUCN GET.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nSince 2004, South Africa has followed an approach that iteratively improves the classification and mapping of marine ecosystem types1. The Marine Ecosystem Map is informed by a broad range of data (Figure 3) derived from many types of surveys, including bathymetric, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity research. It is a large collaborative effort and the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map was developed with contributions from 29 authors from 18 different institutions. The map classification follows a nested hierarchy and the 2023 version sought to align with the IUCN GET structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The range of data that are being used to inform revisions to South Africa’s Marine Ecosystem Map. Increased research and data science investment is improving the marine ecosystem classification and map to support spatial biodiversity assessment, planning, prioritisation and management.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the Marine Ecosystem Map\nLike its predecessors, the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map relied heavily on thematic approaches and expert-informed decision-making. Technological advancements are continuously improving our ability to monitor and survey ocean spaces, rapidly increasing the data available to characterise, delineate and understand marine ecosystems. Work is ongoing to update and improve the next version of the Marine Ecosystem Map, which will inform the following National Biodiversity Assessment.\nSANBI is implementing data and analytical frameworks to leverage the rapidly escalating volumes of ocean data to improve the Marine Ecosystem Map. This framework consists of a collection of scripted and documented workflows hosted in online project repositories. The scripted workflow components can be updated as new data or better methods become available, can be maintained despite turnover in staff and guiding experts, and are making inroads towards more transparent and reproducible science. This data-driven and reproducible approach has included collation of a suite of environmental gridded data layers and biodiversity survey datasets.\nIn regions where sufficient biodiversity data occur, the environmental layers and occurrence records are combined in statistical assemblage distribution models that estimate the co-occurring species assemblages and their preferred habitats, thereby predicting biodiversity patterns and characterising their composition. In regions where insufficient biodiversity data have been collected for the biodiversity analyses, gridded environmental layers are combined in environmental classifications (cluster analyses) to delineate unique habitats (Figure 3). The outputs from the assemblage distribution models and the environmental clusters are used as evidence, together with published biogeographic patterns, to consider updates to the ecosystem map. Updates to ecosystem components or types, such as newly mapped submarine canyons and kelp forests mapped from satellite data2 are being incorporated in the ecosystem map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. The Great African Sea Forest: Kelp forest ecosystem types in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge brown seaweeds of the order Laminariales fringe rocky shores of temperate and high-latitude regions, creating kelp forest ecosystem types that cover over 30% of shallow rocky reefs globally. They are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and offer many social and economic benefits, including fishing, ecotourism, a variety of kelp-derived products, and play a role in fixing atmospheric carbon3. Evidence of consumption of species associated with kelp forests has been dated to about 70 000 years ago in South Africa. The extent of kelp forests has been documented to change, with expansion reported locally4 and cases of kelp loss documented internationally5.\nDunga et al. (2024) created the first comprehensive high-resolution map of canopy forming coastal kelp in South Africa, covering the spatial distribution of Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida and Macrocystis pyrifera2. This work highlighted the need for improved long-term monitoring to understand distributional changes and better mapping of subsurface kelp, particularly Ecklonia radiata, which has been recorded in deeper waters from trawl and remotely operated vehicle surveys on the eastern shelf of South Africa6,7. The kelp map enabled the classification and delineation of three kelp forest ecosystem types in South Africa, the Namaqua, Cape, and Agulhas kelp forests and supported their ecosystem threat status assessment using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Masters student, Ms. Nelisiwe Hambile, is embarking on work to map subsurface kelp forests in South Africa using remotely sensed data, and to assess how they will respond under different climate change scenarios. This work is a collaborative effort with the Seas of Good Hope, SANBI and the University of Cape Town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated environmental layers have been organised by topical project groups, which include oceanography, geology and geomorphology. A suite of oceanographic (physical, chemical and phytoplankton) variables for surface and seafloor depths were downloaded from the Bio-ORACLE platform and calculated from Copernicus Marine Service satellite products and regional ocean model hindcasts provided by SAEON and SOMISANA. Updated sediment data were sourced from collaborators, greatly increasing the inventory of marine sediment sample and seafloor description records. Interpolated maps of sediment characteristics were additionally sourced from dbSEABED. Geomorphological variables included a new, national-scale, 100-m resolution bathymetry map9, from which derived variables such as slope angle, bathymetric position index and rugosity were calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. South Africa’s submarine canyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons are steep-sided valleys that cut into the continental slope and play an important role in connecting coastal and deep-sea environments by facilitating the vertical movement of water, sediments, and nutrients. Many of these canyons host complex terrain, diverse substrate types, habitats and species, including vulnerable marine ecosystem indicators, such as cold-water corals and sponges. They act as important nursery and feeding grounds for a variety of benthic and pelagic species, some of which are conservation priorities, such as the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Furthermore, submarine canyons can act as refuges from anthropogenic pressures, such as trawling, in areas where steep slopes and complex terrain limit human access.\nDespite their ecological importance, many of South Africa’s submarine canyons have remained unknown and unmapped due to limited coverage of high-resolution bathymetry data. The release of the 100-m resolution national-scale bathymetric map in 2024, combined with additional unpublished multibeam echosounder datasets, has enabled a substantial advance in the mapping of submarine canyon features in South Africa, increasing the number of canyon polygons from 39 in 2018 to over 120. This work, led by Nokubonga Mzimela, enhances knowledge on canyon classification and geomorphological processes, identifies shelf-breaching canyons that influence shelf ecology, supports habitat predictions for coelacanths and other species, and will improve the delineation of canyon ecosystem types in the next Marine Ecosystem Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. South Africa’s newly mapped submarine canyons (red outline) overlayed on the new bathymetry map9. (© Nokubonga Mzimela, SANBI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant strides were also made in the collation of marine biodiversity records in a biodiversity occurrence database. Data were sourced from online data repositories, such as OBIS and GBIF and requested from a network of collaborators at a variety of government and tertiary research institutions. In October 2025, the database contained 1 310 081 records from 7 726 marine species and 12 data sources, representing a growing collection of biodiversity data in waters around South Africa. Although only a selection of marine survey datasets have been used in assemblage distribution models, the vision is to build a comprehensive biodiversity database that will enable presence-only modelling of biodiversity patterns and species turnover across broad taxonomic groups sourced from many datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Artificial intelligence and the Southern Africa Marine Biodiversity Reference Image Collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs underwater imaging technology becomes more accessible and widespread, the volume of visual data from marine surveys has outpaced capacity for manual annotations. This has created a need to improve para-taxonomic capacity and AI-powered solutions that can reliably and efficiently extract species occurrence and count data from underwater biodiversity surveys. YOLOv8 and BioCLIP2 models have been fine-tuned to identify marine fishes and invertebrates in Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) footage in work led by PhD candidate, Luther Adams. These models rely on hierarchical taxonomic labels paired with curated images of species. More than 350 benthic invertebrate species across nine phyla have been indexed and catalogued in a standardised reference image database using the SMaTaR_ID framework10. Pipelines have been developed for automating the detection of vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa in ROV videos, threatened seabreams of commercial importance in BRUVs and benthic epifauna for marine ecosystem classification and mapping. Ongoing work aims to expand the species included in the models through curation of high quality and diverse training datasets that underpin model accuracy.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of reproducible data and analytical pipelines marks a shift in ecosystem mapping methods, one that should improve efficiency, transparency and foster greater understanding and confidence in the resulting ecosystem map, which informs biodiversity management, spatial planning, and conservation efforts in South Africa. Further investment in data science will be needed to curate and integrate rapidly expanding data streams if South Africa is to maintain a robust evidence base to underpin improved ecosystem classification, mapping, assessment, planning, mainstreaming and decision-making.",

Note that the area estimates include both benthic and pelagic area beyond the shelf but do not include the subantarctic territory. Inshore and shelf ecosystem types are generally more threatened than those falling within the slope, abyss and open ocean regions. Ecosystem types of smaller extent and that are less widely distributed are at greater risk of extinction1. Overall, six ecosystem types (4% of types) are Critically Endangered, with 31 (19%) Endangered and 36 (22%) Vulnerable. Of the remaining ecosystem types, 19 (12%) and 71 (44%) were Near Threatened and Least Concern, respectively.\nThe locations of the threatened ecosystem types are shown in Figure 1 (Benthopelagic and deepsea benthic) and Figure 2 (pelagic).

The Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf is threatened by demersal trawling (that persists over much of the extent of this ecosystem type2) in addition to flow reduction. The Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge has also been subject to intensive demersal trawling and high demersal longline effort leading to poor ecological condition. Both these ecosystem types were reported as Critically Endangered in 20183 under IUCN RLE Criterion C/D.\nFour additional small ecosystem types listed under this category in 2025 when strictly applying IUCN RLE Criterion B. The Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic is impacted by ongoing flow reduction and marine mining. The KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf has been modified by flow reduction and the demersal inshore crustacean inshore fishery that has subsequently ceased. Cape Bay, which includes Table and Saldanha Bay, has very high cumulative pressures with ongoing degradation linked to port and harbour activities. The Aliwal Shoal Reef Complex falls entirely within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) but ongoing linefishing, waste water discharge and lethal shark control measures cause this ecosystem type, which is of restricted distribution, to be classified as Critically Endangered. Further work to support reef classification and measure ecosystem condition is recommended along with management to reduce pressures in the MPA.\n\n\n\nFauna including grunter, kobs and prawns from the Critically Endangered KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf. (© Kerry Sink)\n\n\n\n\nEndangered\nThere are 31 Endangered ecosystem types (19%) which cover 0.9% extent of the marine realm area. Many of these are ecosystem types of limited extent that were uplisted (considered more threatened) relative to 2019 due to the application of global standards in 2025. For example, False and Walker Bay, St Helena Bay and Eastern Agulhas Bays (Algoa and St Francis) are all Endangered under either criterion B1 or B2 of the IUCN RLE.\n\n\n\nFalse and Walker Bay ecosystem type is now considered Endangered. (© Peter Chadwick)\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable\nVulnerable ecosystem types cover 3.4% of the ocean space, with 36 ecosystem types (22%) falling within this category. All three kelp ecosystem types in South Africa are Vulnerable with cumulative fishing activities playing a key role in declining condition. Two of the 13 pelagic ecosystem types are threatened (South Atlantic Productive Margin Water and Upwelled Agulhas Current Margin Water), both of these being Vulnerable. Key pressures driving decline in condition include large pelagic fishing and mid water trawling. In 2025, all three coral communities were assessed as Vulnerable under the IUCN RLE criterion B3, with coral bleaching and associated ecosystem modification caused by climate change considered the key threat that could lead to ecosystem collapse. This also aligns with the IUCN RLE result for the Delagoa ecoregion in the regional assessments for the Western Indian Ocean4.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s three national coral community ecosystem types were assessed as Vulnerable in 2025 due their restricted distribution and the risk of climate change. These reef types are part of a regional ecosystem type. (© Geoff Spiby)\n\n\n\n\nNear Threatened\nNear Threatened ecosystem types are those that were evaluated to be within 10% of the threshold for Vulnerable. These ecosystems are at risk of ecosystem collapse if increasing pressures lead to further degradation in ecological condition. Examples include the Kingklip Koppies and the Agulhas Exposed Stromatolite Rocky Shore.\n\n\n\nThe Kingkilp Koppies is a Near Threatened ecosystem type off Gqeberha. A co-developed seabed management area will protect this ecosystem type from trawling but further collaborations are needed to secure this area from other activities that may impact the seabed.

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria and drawing from previous NBA assessments. The threat status of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was evaluated applying the IUCN Criteria A-D using pressure and condition maps from the 2018 assessment. Both the extent and severity of ecosystem degradation were considered by calculating the extent of ecosystem types in each of the four ecosystem condition categories. Condition assessments were based on an ecosystem pressure matrix that is used to weight the impact of each pressure on each ecosystem type.\nAs pressure and condition data sets were not updated for the 2025 assessment, it is important to note that changes in ecosystem threat status are largely as a result of refined methods rather than recent loss or degradation in marine ecosystems. New aspects that were considered in the 2025 assessment included Criterion A, habitat loss, and Criterion B, number of threat defined locations, ongoing non-trivial drivers of ecological degradation (as opposed to pressures that have ceased) and stochastic events. Several ecosystem types have shifted into more threatened categories due to the ecosystem extent thresholds provided by the IUCN, but 13 ecosystem types had more positive (less threatened) results due to stricter thresholds for ongoing non-trivial decline in ecological condition.\nThe application of the IUCN global standards supported a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of previous deviations from the IUCN guidelines (such as altered thresholds under Criterion B in 2018) and provided a broader range of plausible results. It also led to the identification of new research priorities and recommendations relevant to current ecosystem mapping efforts and future ecosystem condition assessments that will strengthen assessments. See the ecosystem threat status and RLE explainer page for further information on South Africa’s approach to the assessment of ecosystem threat status.",

Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk (key message A2).\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types now have some representation in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, but only 20% are Well Protected (key message B4). Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves, and open oceans are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s MPA estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. For certain ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status, however, their ecological condition inside MPAs needs improvement (key message C2). Ocean governance needs to better consider and involve human dimensions in conservation initiatives (key message C1), diversify protection models, and address persistent challenges that undermine the legitimacy of conservation areas.\nIn the marine realm, 17% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected. These ecosystem types are found on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge, parts of the Agulhas Bank and parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight (see intersection of ecosystem threat status and protection level page).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of the 163 marine ecosystem types in South Africa, including (A) 128 combined benthopelagic (shelf) and 22 deep-sea benthic (deep-sea) types and (B) 13 deep-sea pelagic types.

    "text": "Species assessments\nMarine species are assessed in terms of their stock status and/or threat status. Stock status refers to the resource status from a fisheries management perspective, whereas species threat status focuses on extinction risk using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria.\nThere is increasing knowledge on stock status of resources, with evidence of resource recovery for some species linked to improved fisheries and spatial management (key message A5). This shows that fish stocks can recover with effective collaborative management of effort, catch and area. However, some inshore resources are increasingly depleted, and abalone and West Coast rock lobster are Endangered. Illegal fishing plays a key role in the Endangered status of these species (key message A6).\nOf the 506 marine species assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria, 36% are considered threatened (key message B1). However, this is an inflated estimate of the actual proportion of marine taxa that are threatened because species that are at risk and/or economically important have been prioritised for assessment, with few marine taxonomic groups being comprehensively assessed.\n\n\n\nSeveral marine invertebrate resources, seabreams and shark and rays were assessed as threatened in 2025. West Coast rocklobster are Endangered (© Geoff Spiby); dageraad are Critically Endangered (© Steve Benjamin); bull sharks are Vulnerable (© Fiona Erst).\n\n\nSharks, rays and chimaeras are one of the most threatened groups across all realms (see species status page). A re-assessment of South Africa’s seabreams showed improved threat status for three species while two have become more threatened. Of the 128 South African shallow reef building corals assessed globally, 34% are threatened by climate change (key message A1).\nMarine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency across all realms, signalling the need to address knowledge gaps, improve monitoring (key message C3), and increase capacity for marine species red listing (key message C3). High levels of data deficiency compromise effective species and ecosystem management, spatial planning, and decision-making.",

    "text": "Pressures and ecological condition\n\n\nThere are many interacting pressures cumulatively affecting marine ecosystems and species. Key pressures impacting marine biodiversity include fishing (including industrial, recreational and illegal fisheries), coastal development (including ports and harbours), pollution, shipping, mining, freshwater flow reduction, lethal shark control measures and climate change.\nFishing, petroleum activities and shipping are widespread sectors resulting in many pressures on multiple ecosystem components and species. Fishing, particularly industrial fishing, continues to exert the greatest pressures on marine biodiversity (key message A5) impacting ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (key message B3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Map of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas represent the highest cumulative pressures, while blue areas represent low pressures. White areas contained no mapped pressures. Click image to expand.\n\n\n\n\n\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which increase access for fishing, alter shorelines and current circulation, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. Pollution including industrial, municipal and noise pollution are key escalating pressures. Seismic surveys to detect potential offshore oil and gas resources have been expanding into deeper waters and, together with shipping and other sources of underwater noise, pose uncertain risks to marine ecosystems and species. Renewable energy production is important in achieving energy security and reducing climate change impacts but marine renewable energy development requires careful consideration of marine biodiversity impacts.\n\n\nThe first groundtruthing of marine ecosystem condition shows that pressure mapping is an effective proxy at broad national scales, but that finer scale pressure mapping can improve condition estimates. However, despite their importance in spatial planning, most marine pressure data are outdated, leading to missing pressures, poor resolution of some pressures, and inaccuracy of pressure impacts on ecosystem condition. Increased monitoring is needed to support assessment of ecosystem and species (key message B5), and to quantify ecological condition more accurately for both biodiversity assessment and guiding management.\nThe impacts of cumulative pressures also warrant consideration at multiple scales, particularly in evaluating the impacts of expanding and diversifying ocean economy activities. Failure to account for indirect and cumulative impacts on biodiversity will mean that important impacts are missed, resulting in poor spatial planning and decisions, with negative impacts on people and the environment (key message A2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Knowledge gaps identified in the 2018 assessment1 were also revisited and progress against these were briefly evaluated to identify persistent knowledge gaps.\nPersistent knowledge gaps and research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in more equitable marine protection (ecosystem protection level page).\n\n\n\nImproving the knowledge base to support inclusion of underwater noise in marine biodiversity assessment and planning is a key research priority with some progress underway.

Gaps remain in systematic genetic barcoding and analyses linked to analyses of seabed and fish fauna imagery and mapping of marine ecosystems and species. Innovative artificial intelligence methodologies can assist in processing large datasets, unlocking these for inclusion in analyses that improve the national marine ecosystem map.\nSouth Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Progress in foundational marine biodiversity science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new field guide entitled Southern African Sea Slugs was published at the end of 2023 and represents a comprehensive update of our knowledge of the opisthobranch fauna. The most recent previous publication for this group was Nudibranchs of Southern Africa, which was published in 1987, covered 268 species. By 2023, a further 600 species had been observed with scuba divers playing a major role in documenting new records. The sheer range and diversity of species included in the guide are a testament to the astonishing biodiversity of the region and also to the diverse community of scientists, photographers, artists and citizen scientists who worked together to create the book.

Innovative and integrated methods that can help address these gaps include imaging approaches, molecular methods, digital taxonomy, active and passive acoustics, citizen science and the strategic connection of biodiversity databases (Rogers et al, 2022). Progress in these complementary areas can increase our understanding of species distribution and feed into improved marine biodiversity assessment at all levels (genetic, species and ecosystems) and multiple scales. Foundational data gaps and capacity constraints limit the IUCN Red List assessment (extinction risk) of marine species. Although dedicated marine species red listing support has been recognised as a key need since 2008 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11 prev NBA), there has been no progress in securing resources or capacity to advance this work (Subramoney et al. 2024).\nSouth Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected. A national genetics monitoring framework is still lacking and the integration of genetic/genomic data into marine spatial plans.\nChallenges in measuring ecosystem condition and developing agreed thresholds of collapse for different ecosystem functional groups include capacity gaps, data and monitoring gaps and conceptual challenges with the need to apply a greater diversity of indicators to this end.\nGroundtruthing ecosystem types remains crucial for ongoing improvement of their descriptions and delineations. For example, the marine realm uses techniques such as remote operated vehicle surveys and seabed sampling (e.g. by grab samples, research trawls and sleds) to collect information on biotic components of ecosystem types; while abiotic data like bathymetry, water turbidity, productivity data and sediments also contribute to ecosystem classification.

An important feature of South Africa’s biodiversity-related action to the pressures on biodiversity has been spatial planning to identify priority areas in the seascape for intervention. The NBA provides an initial portfolio of spatial priorities by highlighting the location of the most threatened ecosystems and species and by intersecting the results of ecosystem threat status and protection level. However, it is not only threatened biodiversity that needs attention; often there are strategic gains to be made from focusing on areas that are still in good ecological condition and where there are relatively easy opportunities for protection or effective management.",

    "text": "Approach\n\nKnowledge gaps\nKnowledge gaps and research priorities were identified throughout the NBA 2025, but also through a systematic review of progress against research priorities identified in the NBA 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority actions\nDrawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 80 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 80 specific actions, a set of 10 overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended indicators of progress that point to a range of sub-actions which if implemented could improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa.\n\n\nPriority areas\nSouth Africa has several established spatial prioritisation tools for informing the work of the biodiversity sector. Principle among these are\n\nthe National Protected Area Expansion Strategy (NPAES),\nSpatial biodiversity plans, which provide maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), together called Critical Biodiversity Area or CBA Maps.\nEcologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs)\n\nTogether these tools provide a comprehensive set of biodiversity priority areas that collectively meet biodiversity targets for ecosystems, species and ecological processes. Increasingly, critical ecological infrastructure assets are also included in this set of biodiversity priority areas. Maps of biodiversity priority areas directly support the implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP).\nMaps of CBAs and ESAs, referred to as CBA maps, are produced by all provincial conservation authorities, marine planners and some metropolitan municipalities and are based on the principles of systematic biodiversity planning. They are a form of strategic planning for the natural environment, identifying a set of geographic areas that provide a spatial plan for ecological sustainability at the landscape and seascape scale. A CBA Map comprises five map categories: Protected Areas (PAs), Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs), Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), Other Natural Areas (ONAs) and areas where there is No Natural habitat Remaining (NNR). Guidelines published by SANBI (SANBI 2017) encourage consistency between the CBAs prepared by different agencies.\nProtected areas, CBAs and ESAs together form a network of natural and semi-natural areas that enable ecologically functional seascapes and landscapes in the long term, designed to be spatially efficient and to avoid conflict with non-compatible land and ocean uses wherever possible. CBAs should be kept in a natural or near natural state to support ecological sustainability of the landscape and seascape. ESAs do not need to be entirely natural, but should be kept at least semi-natural so that they retain their ecological processes. These natural and semi-natural areas can co-exist in a matrix of multiple uses, including fisheries, aquaculture, mining, ports and others.\nLand-based CBA Maps have been produced for over a decade, while the first map of CBAs and ESAs for the coast and ocean was completed in 2019 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11). Since 2019, data collation and analyses have improved with the last published version of the CBA map produced in 2022 (check).",

This has placed the vital services they provide and the incredible biodiversity they support at great risk.\nOnly a third of the total length of river ecosystems in South Africa are in a natural/near-natural ecological condition, with two-thirds in a moderately modified or worse condition. Tributaries are almost equally heavily impacted as mainstem rivers; with 38% of tributary length in a natural/near-natural condition compared to 28% of mainstems.

A wide range of climatic, geological and topographic settings have resulted in an exceptional diversity of wetland ecosystem types, from permanently saturated peatlands that accumulated in place over thousands of years to ephemeral salt pans harbouring newly described invertebrate species. In global terms, South Africa’s wetlands are small, with nearly 50% that are less than 1.5 hectares in size, but they are of outsized importance in a semi-arid context and they frequently function as an inter-connected network across a catchment. Wetlands provide vitally important benefits to people, such as improving water quality and controlling floods. They are water sources, habitats, and refuges for animals and people in times of drought.\nWe have an interim typology in place and are currently at work on an updated national system to understand and manage our wetlands as effectively as possible.

From an ecosystem types perspective about 9% are Well protected, 36% Moderate, 41% Poorly, and 14% Not Protected.\nSince 2011 there has been erosion of protection in historical protected areas caused by removal of no-take restrictions and developing commercial fisheries in Marine protected Areas (MPAs). This is further exasperated by increased illegal gillnetting in protected areas in KZN.\nAn investment in estuarine protection is needed in ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected. Ecosystem types in the Tropical and Warm Temperate biogeographical region are the best protected, while ecosystem types in the Cool Temperate are least protected.",

Estuarine ecosystem type protection level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through improved estuarine management and ecosystem restoration to reduce ecosystem degradation.\nSeveral under protected ecosystem types can advance to Well Protected solely with improved management of fishing and water quality. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi.\nThe global support for 30% protection target (2030 Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3) represent a unique opportunity to garden international support and present funding opportunities to advance estuary protection. Conservation agencies around the coast are in the process to evaluate and extend estuarine protection with local community support, e.g. Olifants Estuary and Verlorenvlei (CapeNature).\nOngoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats. It is less clear, if this mechanism will also be able to protect invertebrates, fish and birds. However, there is no doubt that increased community engagement in protection will create an environment of trust and present opportunities for strengthening protection over time, either as a ‘stepping stone’ for increase formal protection over time or as a sufficient measure one its own.",

Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) and/or Stewardship offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection. Lastly, increasing extent of protection alone will not advance estuarine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of ecosystems in protected areas needs improvement.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The extent of each ecosystem type within the network is expressed as a proportion of the total extent. Four categories of Ecosystem Protection Level are calculated per ecosystem type (n= 22).\n\nWell Protected: 100% of the PA target within PA network; AND only A&B condition estuaries contribute; AND areas under heavy and very heavy fishing pressure are excluded from contributing\nModerately Protected: 50% to 99% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nPoorly Protected: 5% to 49% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nNot Protected: less than 5% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\n\nThe PA target was historically set at 20% for marine and estuarine ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework - the protected areas target was increased to 30% in the EPL calculations (previous time points (2018) were recalculated using this higher target). Ecosystem condition data (van Niekerk et al., 2025) for each time point allow for only good condition estuaries without heavey fishing pressure (especially systems under severe gill-netting pressure) to be considered representative for Well Protected status; while for Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected and Not Protected the condition of the estuaries is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets such that higher integrity / condition estuaries contribute more to meeting protected areas targets than low integrity / condition estuaries.",

From an ecosystem types perspective about 9% are Well protected, 36% Moderate, 41% Poorly, and 14% Not Protected.\nSince 2011 there has been erosion of protection in historical protected areas caused by removal of no-take restrictions and developing commercial fisheries in Marine protected Areas (MPAs). This is further exasperated by increased illegal gillnetting in protected areas in KZN.\nAn investment in estuarine protection is needed in ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected.

    "text": "Opportunities to improve ecosystem protection level\n\nThere is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through improved estuarine management and ecosystem restoration to reduce ecosystem degradation.\nSeveral under protected ecosystem types can advance to Well Protected solely with improved management of fishing and water quality. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi.\nThe global support for 30% protection target (2030 Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3) represent a unique opportunity to garden international support and present funding opportunities to advance estuary protection. Conservation agencies around the coast are in the process to evaluate and extend estuarine protection with local community support, e.g. Olifants Estuary and Verlorenvlei (CapeNature).\nOngoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats. It is less clear, if this mechanism will also be able to protect invertebrates, fish and birds. However, there is no doubt that increased community engagement in protection will create an environment of trust and present opportunities for strengthening protection over time, either as a ‘stepping stone’ for increase formal protection over time or as a sufficient measure one its own.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Estuarine Ecosystem Protection Levels in South Africa by percentage of types (# contributing estuaries indicated on bar) (a) and percentage extent (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) and/or Stewardship offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection. Lastly, increasing extent of protection alone will not advance estuarine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of ecosystems in protected areas needs improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

    "text": "Approach\nThe protection level assessment for estuarine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets. While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target. In order for a estuarine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural / near natural ecological condition. If this target was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected. Additionally, any area inside a protected area that was in degraded condition had it’s contribution to the protection level target scaled according to the severity of the degradation.\nUsing as input data the South African Protected Areas Database (SAPAD) 2024Q4 (Department of Forestry Fisheries and Environment), South African estuary ecosystem map (van Niekerk 2020) and estuarine health condition as input data.\nEstuarine Condition (Health) scores (0-100) are assigned to Department of Water and Sanitation Present Ecological Status (PES) categories (A-F) and NBA Modification categories (Natural - Severely modified) according to the table below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3. NEEDS A CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition score (0-100)\nPES category\nModification category\n\n\n\n\n&gt;= 90\nA\nNatural\n\n\n&gt;=75 & &lt; 90\nB\nNear Natural\n\n\n&gt;= 60 & &lt; 75\nC\nModerately Modified\n\n\n&gt;=40 & &lt; 60\nD\nHeavily Modified\n\n\n&lt; 40\nE/F\nSeverely/Critically Modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection Level is an indicator developed in South Africa that measures the representation of ecosystem types within the protected area network. The extent of each ecosystem type within the network is expressed as a proportion of the total extent. Four categories of Ecosystem Protection Level are calculated per ecosystem type (n= 22).\n\nWell Protected: 100% of the PA target within PA network; AND only A&B condition estuaries contribute; AND areas under heavy and very heavy fishing pressure are excluded from contributing\nModerately Protected: 50% to 99% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nPoorly Protected: 5% to 49% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nNot Protected: less than 5% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\n\nThe PA target was historically set at 20% for marine and estuarine ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework - the protected areas target was increased to 30% in the EPL calculations (previous time points (2018) were recalculated using this higher target). Ecosystem condition data (van Niekerk et al., 2025) for each time point allow for only good condition estuaries without heavey fishing pressure (especially systems under severe gill-netting pressure) to be considered representative for Well Protected status; while for Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected and Not Protected the condition of the estuaries is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets such that higher integrity / condition estuaries contribute more to meeting protected areas targets than low integrity / condition estuaries.",

    "text": "South Africa has 290 estuaries and 42 micro-estuaries, which have been classified into 22 estuarine ecosystems and 3 micro-estuary types. This high diversity of estuary types stems from the country’s diverse climatic, oceanographic and geological drivers. Four biogeographical regions characterise the South African coast; namely the Cool Temperate (Orange to Ratel), the Warm Temperate (Heuningnes to Mendwana), the Subtropical (Mbashe to St Lucia) and the Tropical (uMgobezeleni to Kosi) (Emanuel et al. 1992; Harrison 2002; Turpie et al. 2000). Rainfall in these regions varies significantly from less than 100 mm along the arid west coast to about 1 200 mm along the east coast.\nIn South Africa, there are circa 176 estuarine-associated plant species, the majority (56 species) of which are associated with salt marsh habitat. Estuary habitats in South Africa cover a total area of 103 500 ha, with reeds and sedges (17 500 ha) the dominant habitat type. On a bioregional scale, supratidal salt marsh dominates in the Cool temperate region (6 300 ha) and Warm temperate region (2 400 ha), reeds and sedges in the Subtropical region (10 800 ha), and swamp forest in the Tropical region (2 000 ha). Estuaries with the largest extent are St Lucia (44 800 ha), Groot Berg (8 000 ha) and Knysna (2 400 ha). The number of macrophyte species per estuary varied from 1 to 54 (recorded at Kosi). Macrophyte species richness in estuaries of the Cool and Warm Temperate region is higher than that in the Subtropical and Tropical region. Macrophyte species are distributed amongst 58 families . Only 66 plant species occurred in five or more estuaries in the country.\nApproximately 50 of the 150 estuarine-associated fish species that regularly occur in estuaries are Southern African endemics of which 20 are exclusively found in South African waters with some species confined to only a few systems. For example, the iconic Knysna seahorse only occurs in three estuaries (Knysna, Swartvlei, Keurbooms), the Bot River Klipvis in two estuaries (Bot/Kleinmond and Klein) and the Estuarine Pipefish in five estuaries (historically Bushmans, Kariega, Kasouga, East and West Kleinemonde but currently only confirmed in first two systems).\nThe importance of South Africa’s estuaries for resident and migratory waterbirds has long been recognised. A total of 35 bird species are considered highly dependent on estuaries as more than 15% of their regional population is found in these systems. The 118 waterbird species found in South African estuaries belong to eight orders, 25 families and 73 genera. While most species are found throughout the coast, there are some species which are predominantly confined to the west of the country, and in general, species richness increases towards the east, into the subtropical and tropical regions.\nEven important ‘bait’ invertebrate species Sandprawn (Callichirus kraussii), Mud Prawn (Upogebia africana) and Macrobrachium petersii are southern African endemics, while the freshwater Sand-shrimp (Palaemon capensis) is a South African endemic.\nOur estuarine biodiversity underpins food security and economic opportunities, and is part of the deep cultural and spiritual values of South Africa’s coast. The 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment identified key estuarine ecosystems and benefits at risk, and high lights priority actions to safeguard life and livelihoods, and maintain the many benefits of South Africa’s exceptional biodiversity",

    "text": "Ecosystem assessments\nThe Estuarine Realm is one of the most threatened in South Africa, in terms of both number of ecosystem types and by area. Of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types, 59% are threatened with 23% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered and 18% Vulnerable. Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.\nOverall, Cool Temperate and Subtropical ecosystems are at higher risk of ecosystem collapse. The most threatened ecosystem functional groups are Estuarine bays, Estuarine lakes, Large fluvially dominated, Large temporarily closed, and Arid predominantly closed types. Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk.\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types now have some representation in the protected areas network, but only 1% are Well Protected. Large Fluvially Dominated, Predominantly Open, Estuarine Bay (Subtropical), Large temporarily closed and Arid predominantly closed are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s estuarine protected area estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. Importantly, however, the ecological condition of estuaries in protected areas also needs improvement for ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi. Estuarine conservation also needs to better consider and involve people, diversify protection models, and address issues that undermine legitimacy. The ongoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats.\nIn the estuarine realm, 22% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the Cool Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions. These include the following five ecosystem types:\n\nCool Temperate Arid Predominantly Closed (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord), Wadrift)\nCool Temperate Estuarine Lakes (Verlorenvlei, Zeekoei, Bot/Kleinmond, Klein)\nCool Temperate Large Fluvially Dominated (Orange)\nCool Temperate Predominantly Open (Olifants, Groot Berg, Uilkraals)\nSubtropical Estuarine Bay (Durban Bay)",

Overall, Cool Temperate and Subtropical ecosystems are the most degraded.

Key concerns are escalating gillnetting pressure, declining water quality, increased flow reduction, and land-use change in the estuarine functional zone (mining & farming).\nThere are many interacting pressures cumulatively affecting estuarine ecosystems and species.

Of the groups considered, only birds were comprehensively assessed. Future assessments need to include all representatives of a taxonomic group to remedy this bias.\nIncreased extinction risk for estuarine species is attributed to multiple pressures, with overfishing (including by recreational, small-scale, commercial and illegal fisheries), pollution, flow reduction, biological invasions, coastal development, agriculture and mining contributing most to the threatened status of estuarine species.",

    "text": "Responses\nSouth Africa has a strong policy and legislative framework to protect and manage estuaries. Excellent progress has been made in the management of estuaries in water and land use/planning sector. Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has determined the ecological water requirements of all estuaries, with 100% of these being subject to the “Classification” of freshwater resources. In addition, over 20% of estuaries have Estuary Management Plans in various stages of completion under the guidance of DFFE, provinces and conservation agencies. These noteworthy progresses since 2018 play a critical role in ensuring estuary health and the multiple benefits that society derives from them. These measures are proactive in that they set management objectives for estuarine resources on the strategic level through the engagement of society in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, there has been a deterioration in the management of extractive use in estuaries, with sand, mineral and diamond mining key concerns.\nThere is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral arrangements between sectors dealing with Environment, Water, Fishing and Mining to ensure optimum resource allocation. In many of the above sectors, management measures/processes do not meet biodiversity requirements, e.g. freshwater flow allocation to the uMlalazi Estuary in the Thukela Marine Protected Area (MPA) is not sufficient to prevent increased constricted/closed mouth conditions developing during low flow periods with associated poor water quality resulting in low oxygen conditions. Given that estuarine management straddles multiple sectors, a more robust intergovernmental engagement could assist in ensuring a balance in sectoral requirements and preventing mandate conflict between departments.\nAvailability of cheap gillnets online (e.g. Temo, Takelot, Shein) have led to exponential increase in estuary fishing pressure. This indiscriminate fishing method catches juvenile fish, macro invertebrates, birds, turtles and terrapins, water monitors and crocodiles. Authorities launched DFFE Gillnet Reporting App (OCIMS) to monitor illegal catches and established a well co-ordinate compliance network in KZN. An example of success achieved is that 80% of nets are retrieved before they catch anything and for every 39 fish caught per illegal net retrieved 21 is released alive. Overall catches peaked in 2023/24. Compliance initiatives needs to be supported by community education and awareness programmes, increase customs control (stop imports), and collaboration with online retailers to foster self-regulation. The retailer Macro is example of self-regulation as they removed gillnets form their stock once the company became aware of the cascading impacts on estuarine and coastal ecosystems.\nInvestment is needed in solutions to restore estuarine ecological infrastructure to strengthen climate resilience and sustain ecosystem services. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework makes restoration and protection of critical ecosystems an imperative at a global scale. Restoration projects has been initiated at a few key estuary sites in South Africa, e.g. St Lucia, Groot Berg, Swartkops, Mlalazi. Ongoing research have also identified critical systems (e.g. Orange, Olifants, Klein Brak, Gamtoos) that will ensure the best return on investment. DFFE and the provincial authorities are engaging in an ‘Estuary Restoration Strategy’ that focuses on degraded and novel systems with an emphasis on the larger systems of high biodiversity importance and the socially importan\n\n\n\nKromme Estuary with extensive salt marsh. © Riaan Weitz.",

    "text": "Defining and delineating the ecologically determined coastal zone\nUnlike the terrestrial, inland aquatic, estuarine and marine assessments, all of which assess ecosystem types per realm, the coast assessment is undertaken in a cross-realm zone. The reason for focusing on the coast specifically is because the majority of the world’s population lives in this zone1, concentrating pressures on biodiversity. Unless assessed separately, trends in coastal biodiversity relative to the rest of the land and sea are lost in the individual realm assessments.\nThere are lots of different definitions and boundaries of coastal zones. For purposes like biodiversity assessments, the extent of the coast needs to comprise whole ecosystem types because that is the unit of assessment. Using whole ecosystem types also means that the results from the separate realm assessments can be extracted and summarized for the coast.\nSubstantial effort went into delineating an ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) for the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018 by seamlessly aligning the separate realm ecosystem maps, and tagging relevant ecosystem types in the terrestrial, estuarine and marine realm as ‘coastal’ based on a set of criteria2. The premise underpinning these criteria is that ecosystem types are considered coastal if they have a direct influence from both the land and sea:\n\nTerrestrial ecosystem types: all vegetation types influenced by the sea, including:\n\nCoastal Vegetation – vegetation types with purely coastal descriptions, and/or with &gt;95% of their extent within 2.5 km of the seashore\nSemi-Coastal Vegetation – vegetation types with coastal affinities mentioned in description, and/or with &gt;70% of their extent within 10 km of the seashore\n\nEstuarine ecosystem types: all estuary and micro-estuary types are included in the EDCZ\nMarine ecosystem types: all marine ecosystem types influenced by land are coastal, including:\n\nAll ecosystem types between the shore and the fair-weather wave base (depth at which ocean waves start to interact with the sea floor)\nAll river-influenced marine ecosystem types\n\n\nThis criteria-based approach means that as ecosystem maps update per realm, the changes are incorporated in updates of the EDCZ.",

    "text": "South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types\nThe cool Benguela and warm Agulhas currents that flow around South Africa drive steep gradients in climate and environmental conditions from west to east, resulting in diverse coastal ecosystem types and associated species, many of which are found no where else on earth3. The west coast is cool and arid, and the east coast is warm and wet, with a moderate south coast between them. The biogeography around the South African coast thus ranges from cool temperate in the west, through warm temperate in the south, to subtopical and tropical in the east.\nThe EDCZ has been updated for the NBA 2025 based on updates to the respective realm maps, and currently comprises 190 ecosystem types3 (Figure 1):\n\n83 vegetation types: dunes and seashore vegetation, strandveld, duneveld, dune thicket, and coastal thicket, forests and fynbos\n22 estuary ecosystem types: predominantly open, temporarily closed, and fluvially dominated estuaries, and estuarine lakes, bays and lagoon\n85 marine ecosystem types: sandy beaches, shingle shores and boulder shores, mixed shores, rocky shores, microbialites, islands, reefs, kelp forests, bays, hard and soft inner shelf, and river-influenced ecosystem types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. South Africa’s ecologically determined coastal zone comprises 190 ecosystem types from the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realms that all support a rich diversity of species, many of which are endemic to South Africa.\n\n\n\nTechnically, there are an additional three microestuary ecosystem types that are also included in the EDCZ3. However, because microestuaries are not assessed in the National Biodiversity Assessments, they are excluded from the count of coastal ecosystem types in the NBA 2025 content to simplify the statistics and reporting.\nAlthough there is not yet enough information to systematically identify inland aquatic ecosystem types as coastal and non-coastal, this is an area of work that needs more research. There is planned inclusion of freshwater types in future (e.g., freshwater forested wetlands, dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones).\nThe coastal ecosystem types are listed below (Table 1). For a descriptive overview of these ecosystem types, and inland aquatic ecosystem types proposed to be included in future, refer to the publication.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Within this group, the ecosystem types that are are highest risk of loss are those that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected).\nThere are 118 threatened coastal ecosystem types that are under-protected in South Africa (Table 1). This means that all but 16 of the 134 threatened coastal ecosystem types are currently under-protected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

These include 38 terrestrial, 7 estuarine and 23 marine ecosystem types (Table 1, Table 2) that urgently need improved conservation and management if their associated biodiversity and benefits are to be safeguarded into the future.\nThe highly threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are found all along the national coast, particularly around the Orange River mouth, in the Western Cape, between St Francis and Gqeberha, and in southern and central KwaZulu-Natal (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

As a result, human population densities are much higher closer to the shore than further inland. In fact, there are more people living within 50 km of the shore today as lived on Earth in the 1930s1. This means that the human footprint is generally much higher in the coastal zone than elsewhere.\nThe distinct geographic position of the coast at the interface between land and sea also means that it is exposed to multiple pressures from land-based, estuarine, and marine sources. In fact, of all pressures to biodiversity mapped in the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realm assessments, only four pressures are absent from the coastal zone (all of which are types of deep-sea fishing).",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal ecosystem types\nThe pressures on coastal biodiversity are briefly summarized below under the 10 categories established by the IUCN (Figure 1), with some slight terminology adjustments. Click the headings to view or hide the information per pressure category.\n\n\n1. Biological resource use\n\n\n There are many forms of biological resource use in the coastal zone, with different levels of sustainability and impact to coastal biodiversity. (© Ryan Daly)\n\nSouth Africa’s coast is rich in biological resources on land, in estuaries and in the sea that are harvested for food, medicine, symbolism, and materials. Resources such as invertebrates, fish, birds, mammals, seaweeds, and plants are collected both legally and illegally, with key concerns regarding over-harvesting, bycatch, and ghost fishing. Unsustainable resource use impacts populations of target and non-target species and their respective predators, causes changes in trophic and demographic structures of foodwebs, alters energy flow through and among ecosystems, and some collection methods cause habitat damage. Certain species are particularly impacted by poaching, e.g., abalone and succulent plants.\n\n\n\n2. Energy production and mining\n\n\nMining is a key pressure on coastal biodiversity, particularly the serial mining along the west coast. (© Linda Harris)\n\nSouth Africa’s mineral wealth is comparable to its outstanding biodiversity, and mining is a key economic activity in the country. In the coastal zone, sand, diamonds, and heavy minerals are mined in legal and illegal operations. Mining is an intense pressure on biodiversity with long-term impacts from habitat fragmentation and loss, and species disturbance and extirpations. It can also cause pollution, proliferation of alien and invasive species, and changes in habitat characteristics that have knock-on effects to species.\nImpacts to coastal biodiversity in South Africa from petroleum exploration and production are primarily in the marine realm, with increasing interest in offshore operations as part of national imperatives to grow the country’s blue economy. Petroleum activities can cause habitat loss, introduction of alien and invasive species, and various forms of pollution - including oil spills - that collectively cause habitat degradation; impact species communication, feeding, distributions and migrations; and increase the likelihood of ship-strikes to marine animals.\nRenewable energy is important for achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts, and supporting socio-economic growth in the country. Current operations in South Africa’s coastal zone include wind farms, with planned solar energy plants and green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia initiatives), and potential offshore wind farms. Impacts to biodiversity include habitat fragmentation and loss, species disturbance, collisions with wind turbines, and extirpations, as well as potential pollution.\n\n\n\n3. Pollution\n\n\nPollution from plastics, wastewater, artificial light at night, noise, and obsolete ammunition are degrading the ecological condition of coastal ecosystems. (© Fiona MacKay)\n\nPlastic pollution is present all along South Africa’s coastal zone, with substantial quantities washing into the coastal zone during flood events. The impact of plastics on biodiversity, especially coastal and marine biodiversity, has become very apparent in recent years and there are numerous campaigns globally to stop single-use plastics in particular, and to reduce use of plastics generally. Key concerns include: animal entanglement, which can lead to injury, suffocation or drowning; ingestion causing gut blockages; accumulation of chemicals derived from plastic ingestion in animal tissue; and potential increases in spread of alien and invasive species.\nLand-based wastewater discharge is a significant source of chemical pollution and comprises a range of effluents and polluted runoff. Wastewater enters the sea via estuaries and outfalls, polluting ground- and surface water and sediments. Areas with high levels of organic nutrients cause eutrophication, fuel red tides and harmful algal blooms, and can cause anoxia, which may lead to fish kills. There is increasing concern over the quantities of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals and hydrocarbons recorded in the coastal zone that can accumulate in foodwebs, with risks to human health.\nArtificial light at night makes naturally dark areas lighter, altering natural cycles of light and dark, and impacting species’ circadian rhythms and night-time behaviour. Impacts to coastal species have been recorded in rocky shore communities, dune vertebrates, plants, pollinators, sea turtles, and intertidal fish, and it is one of the key pressures impacting threatened beach invertebrates, e.g., the Endangered Cape pillbug, Tylos capensis.\nSound travels more readily through water, making noise pollution a particular concern in aquatic environments, especially as oceans become busier and noisier. Noise can cause direct mortality, impaired hearing, and lower immunity and increased health risks of species. It also disrupts animal communication and social behaviour, limits bird-call repertoires, impacts animal foraging behaviour and success, and alters species distributions as they avoid noisier areas.\nDisposing ammunition, such as artillery shells, and expired, unusable or obsolete ammunition, at sea was practiced in South Africa from the 1970s until 1995. There are several concerns for marine biodiversity: corrosion of munitions and resulting pollution and toxicity (especially from heavy metals like lead and mercury) in the surrounding environment; potential detonation, causing localised destruction; and changes to the physical environment and potential damage or smothering of natural ecosystems due to presence of foreign structures and/or damage to habitat-forming species.\n\n\n\n4. Coastal development\n\n\nCoastal development is a significant pressure on coastal biodiversity, causing habitat fragmentation and loss. (© Linda Harris)\n\nCoastal development is one of the most important pressures on coastal biodiversity because it causes largely irreversible habitat fragmentation and loss, with associated impacts to species distributions and population abundance, increasing extinction risk. Ecosystems are degraded further when ecological processes are disrupted, and ecological infrastructure and ecological resilience are compromised, in turn reducing ecosytem services and benefits to people. When infrastructure is built too close to the shore, beaches are at risk of complete inundation and loss as sea levels rise, with no option for them to naturally realign further inland. Broadly speaking, the areas in South Africa associated with ports and harbours are most intensively developed.\n\n\n\n5. Transportation and service corridors\n\n\nPorts and harbours are sources of multiple pressures on coastal ecosystems, and transport corridors disrupt cross-realm connectivity and ecological processes. (© Riaan Weitz)\n\nPorts and harbours are hubs of activity, development, and access to the sea. The impacts to biodiversity from associated activities include being hotspots of pollution, and high-risk entry points and refugia for alien and invasive species, with local habitat modification and degradation from anchorage, maintenance dredging and dredge spoil dumping. Offshore bunkering (ship-to-ship transfer of fuel) can have deleterious impacts to marine life, especially threatened colonial seabirds, e.g., African Penguins and Cape Gannets.\nSouth Africa is a hub of shipping activity, with eight commercial ports that receive international trade. The main biodiversity impacts associated with shipping are: impacts from oil spills during shipping accidents; underwater noise; ship strikes with large marine animals; introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling; and various forms of pollution, including when ships lose their cargo at sea.\nMany roads and railway lines that run along South Africa’s coastline break connectivity of ecological processes across the land-sea interface, and in some places, are very precariously positioned and are at risk of damage and collapse in the face of heavy swell and floods. Roads and railway lines also run over estuaries on bridges, which changes sediment flow downstream, and can cause mouth closure and lead to eutrophication. Connectivity of terrestrial species through their distributions is also impacts by linear infrastructure, with many species being injured or killed by moving vehicles.\n\n\n\n6. Natural systems modifications\n\n\nAltering natural flows of freshwater and sediments, e.g., the weir in the uThukela River, impacts estuarine systems and downstream beaches and marine mud belts. (© Fiona MacKay)\n\nInterruption of sand-flow processes impacts sand budgets that maintain beaches and dunes. Sand is transported to and along the coast by rivers and estuaries, wind (including through wind-driven mobile dunefields), and by waves and inshore currents. The dune-beach-surf zone within which sand moves is called the littoral active zone, where erosion (sand removal) and accretion (sand build up) are natural processes. Blocking these flows by stabilising sand dunes, replacing foredunes with coastal development, and constructing dams and weirs in estuaries reduces the amount of sand available to beaches and dunes, decreasing their resilience to large storms and sea-level rise.\nHealthy functioning rivers deliver freshwater, nutrients and sediments to estuaries and the ocean, and sand to beaches and dunes. Hydrological regime change and freshwater flow reduction in estuaries from water abstraction, large impoundments and small farm dams impacts both estuarine ecosystems and downstream marine ecosystems. Without sufficient flow, water quality declines, salinity regimes are compromised, and sediment accumulates in estuary mouths, often increasing the risk of coastal flooding. Estuarine connectivity, and fish nursery functions are also compromised, with knock-on effects for marine fisheries. Trapping sediment in catchments also cuts off sand and mud supplies to downstream beaches and marine mud belts, respectively. Artificial breaching also alters natural hydrological regimes in estuaries, and can have potentially cascading impacts on the physico-chemistry of the estuary and its biological components.\nAlthough coastal rangelands are generally a biodiversity-compatible land use, under some circumstances they can pose risks to coastal ecosystems. Livestock grazing and browsing and associated trampling can contribute to dune destabilisation, and to increased susceptibility to erosion of dunes and estuarine banks. Livestock grazing and browsing can also stunt the growth of mangrove trees and reduce biomass of salt marsh, reducing blue carbon in estuarine systems.\n\n\n\n7. Human intrusions and disturbance\n\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities in the seashore zone that cause erosion and lethal and non-lethal impacts to species. (© Linda Harris)\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities, such as trampling, off-road vehicle (ORV) driving, in-water recreation, and boating in estuaries and the sea. Biota can get crushed, injured, or disturbed, and shorebirds can be disturbed during breeding and foraging. Trampling in dunes also risks erosion and formation of blowouts. Virtually the entire South African shoreline is accessible by foot, and is thus potentially vulnerable to human disturbance in some form.\n\n\n\n8. Aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry\n\n\nThere is disproportionately more aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry in the coastal zone than in the rest of the land and sea, causing a variety of impacts to coastal biodiversity. (© Daniel Lemley)\n\nAlong the South African coast, mariculture operations take the form of in-situ aquatic operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages, and land-based aquaculture operations abstract sea water, pass it through a culture facility, and then return it to the marine environment. One of the main biodiversity concerns associated with aquaculture is introduction of alien and potentially invasive species to the natural environment. Other concerns include transfer of disease and pathogens to local populations; potential for emergence of superbugs due to the use of antibiotics; genetic exchange between farmed and wild populations; and changed behaviour of apex predators around installations.\nAgricultural practices vary in terms of their impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Cultivation of croplands requires clearing natural habitats, resulting in habitat loss, and contaminated agricultural return flow can pollute estuarine and marine systems, causing eutrophication. Abandoned croplands may be impacted further by unsustainable livestock grazing and alien invasive species in fallow areas.\nCommercial afforestation threatens a host of coastal species through fragmentation and loss of indigenous vegetation. The concentration of a large numbers of trees can also change the local hydrology, lowering the water table and impacting streams, wetlands and indigenous plants. Plantation canopies cause shading, soil acidification and aridification, and can alter understory growth and nutrient availability to indigenous biota.\n\n\n\n9. Invasive and other problematic species and diseases\n\n\nIndigenous species are being impacted by invasive alien species, e.g., deliberately introduced species to stabilise dunes, and unintentionally introduced species from shipping, and other problematic species and diseases. (© Linda Harris)\n\nInvasive alien species are an established pressure on land, but an emerging pressure in estuaries and the sea. Many of the terrestrial invasive alien species in coastal areas are present because of deliberate introductions, e.g., to stabilize mobile dunes at a time when this was considered to be best practice. In contrast, introduction of invasive alien species to the estuarine and marine realms has been generally unintentional, e.g. through hull fouling and ballast water. Invasive alien species can change community composition and local ecological processes, with direct and indirect effects on indigenous species. Invasive alien species can also contribute to wildfires and alter natural fire regimes, reduce mean annual runoff, and can reduce light, oxygen and flow in estuaries, with knock-on affects to biodiversity.\nThe frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in South Africa’s coastal zone, largely due to increased nutrient loading from municipal wastewater, urban stormwater, and agricultural runoff. HABs impact estuarine and coastal marine systems by causing hypoxia, impacting biodiversity and causing mass mortalities, with potential risks to human health as well.\nSeveral other pathogens and diseases are impacting coastal species, including High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza in seabirds, rabies in seals, and a water mold (Aphanomyces invadans) that causes epizootic ulcerative syndrome in fish that is now found in almost all estuaries in South Africa.\n\n\n\n10. Climate change, severe weather, and ocean acidification\n\n\nClimate change is predicted to impact coastal ecosystems and species in a variety of ways, such as marine heatwaves causing coral bleaching. (© Kerry Sink)\n\nWhere coasts are unconstrained, sea-level rise does not pose a risk to coastal biodiversity because the shore will naturally realign further inland. However, where the coast has been built up with development within the littoral active zone, particularly where it is defended with seawalls, the consequence is that the shores are trapped in a coastal squeeze, with long-term risks of infrastructure failure as well. Supralittoral and high shore species are most at risk of loss, including loss of nesting and foraging habitat for shorebirds. Sea-level rise will affect saline penetration and mouth state in estuaries, altering estuarine ecology, and mangroves and salt marsh habitats may be impacted too.\nClimate-change predictions for South Africa include altered rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme events, such as droughts, storms and floods. The South African east coast is predicted to get wetter, particularly from heavy rainfall events and floods, and the west coast is predicted to get drier, where recent droughts attributed to climate change have increased the extinction risk to endemic plants. Increased storminess increases coastal erosion, and can impact estuarine ecology. Although coastal ecosystems are generally able to return to pre-storm conditions, this is dependent on the frequency of events.\nCoastal species are shifting their ranges in response to temperature change. This could lead to various changes in communities as biological interactions change, and pioneer species may trigger ecological successions. Coastal endemic species along the south coast may also experience a temperature squeeze between the Cool Temperate and Subtropical bioregions. Other impacts include increased likelihood and spread of wildfires, dried up water holes, and altered animal behaviour.\nExtreme temperatures may have more significant impacts than overall trends in warming and cooling. Heatwaves can cause mortality in indigenous plants and favour spread of invasives, and marine heatwaves can cause coral bleaching. Thermal shock to fish and invertebrates in the marine environment may be exacerbated when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling events, causing washouts and mortalities.\nSouth African waters are more susceptible to impacts from ocean acidification because of the biochemistry of upwelled water, making systems like the Benguela naturally more acidic (lower pH). However, macroalgal habitats are less acidic (higher pH) than their surrounding environment, and may act as refugia for coastal species. Ocean pH levels are variable around South Africa in both space and time. Natural fluctuations in ocean acidity may either help create resilience in coastal species, or combine with gradual trends to produce more extreme conditions and impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of each of these pressures, refer to the published review on cross-realm pressures on coastal biodiversity in South Africa.",

For a broader comparison of pressures among realms, see the integrated findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Bubble plot showing the relative severity of pressures across realms and in the coastal zone.\n\n\n\nThe disproportionate impact of pressures on coastal biodiversity is also evident in the landcover maps.

    "text": "Ecological condition of coastal ecosystem types\nMapping ecological condition essentially gives a spatial representation of the overall effect of various pressures on biodiversity, and is one of the input datasets for calculating ecosystem threat status. Ecological condition is estimated using different approaches in the different realms: in the terrestrial assessment it relies primarily on land-cover change; in the estuarine assessment, a multi-criteria framework is used; and in the marine assessment, cumulative pressure mapping is used. For details on the realm-specific methods, see the individual realm pages on ecological condition (terrestrial, estuaries, marine).\nAlthough different methods for calculating ecological condition were used in the separate realm assessments, they were aligned as far as possible to allow for cross-realm comparisons and unified terminology. Ultimately, these are presented in the coastal assessment in four simplified categories: natural/near-natural; moderately modified; heavily modified; and severely/critically modified. These are explained further in the ecological condition section of the integrated findings.\nThe ecological condition of all coastal ecosystem types was extracted from the three realm assessments and compiled into a single map, revealing that almost half (48%) of the South African coast is in a modified state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified (Figure 3, Figure 4). There is also more than double the amount of natural habitat that has been modified in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas (Figure 4).\nBroadly speaking, the places with the highest population density are associated with coastal areas in the most heavily to critically modified ecological condition. These include the southwestern Cape, southeastern Cape, and most of KwaZulu-Natal. Importantly, these areas are all associated with ports and harbours, and their related burgeoning development in the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

There is evidence of population declines by 50-80% based on commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in South Africa over the past 10 years, disappearance of the species at sites that have been mined in Namibia, and anecdotal evidence of severe declines and/or disappearance of the species at certain beaches in South Africa. Harmful algal blooms can also cause mass mortalities. The overall population is suspected to have declined by over 50% in the past decade and it is therefore assessed as Endangered under Criterion A2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis(© Linda Harris)\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis (Cape calloused beach pillbug) is endemic to South Africa. It has a limited range and restricted habitat along the South African south coast, with between 9 and 12 locations extant. It is experiencing ongoing loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat to expanding coastal development and artificial light at night (ALAN), and has been lost from at least four locations, including inside protected areas. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus(© Linda Harris)\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus (granulated calloused beach pillbug) is restricted to the coast of Namibia and South Africa. It generally occurs in low numbers, and is found in large abundances (hundreds to thousands of individuals) in only a few places. Extirpations have been recorded at the southern end of its range due to coastal development, there are no recent records in the northern part of its range, and it is impacted by mining. Kelp wrack removal takes away an important source of food for this species. Collectively these pressures are causing notable declines in its habitat availability and quality, and declines in the number of mature individuals. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis(© Linda Harris)\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis (beach ground beetle) is a southern African endemic species, found only in the supralittoral habitat on sandy beaches along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. It burrows in the sand or hides under kelp wrack, feeding on invertebrates associated with wrack. Approximately 80% of its recent (since 2000) range is exposed to mining, coastal development and/or kelp wrack removal. These pressures are causing declines in habitat extent, quality, and population abundance, and there is evidence that the species has been lost from some sites that have been mined. The population is inferred to be severely fragmented, comprising small, isolated subpopulations across its range. It is therefore listed as Endangered under Criterion B.",

    "text": "What are biodiversity biobanks?\nBiodiversity biobanks, genetic resource banks, genetic repositories or genebanks can be described as scientific collections of different types of preserved biomaterials from biological organisms including tissue, DNA, blood, cell cultures, embryos, reproductive material such as seeds, eggs and sperm, and even whole organisms. These collections are usually preserved by freezing or cold storage. Environmental samples such as water or soil are increasingly being collected and stored for analyses of the biological communities in these habitats. For any type of biobank, one of the main qualifying criteria is that the biomaterials and associated data must be preserved and managed according to rigorous scientific standards and protocols to ensure the viability and quality of the material.\nExtant and even recently extinct species across the entire tree of life can be represented in biodiversity biobanks, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protists, as well as plants and animals but materials originating from humans are usually excluded. Biodiversity biobanks can include indigenous, naturally occurring species, exotic species and, in the context of agrobiodiversity, also breeds and varieties of cultivated crops and domesticated livestock.\nBiodiversity biobanks are recognised as essential infrastructure that preserves, manages and provides biomaterials representing currently and potentially threatened, useful, and harmful organisms, for research, conservation, sustainable use and biotechnology development. Biodiversity biobanks offer valuable materials that enable comparisons across taxa, regions and time, and they help to preserve biological material from species, populations, or strains that are rare, declining, or even extinct in the wild. Recent breakthroughs in DNA and RNA sequencing such as High Throughput Sequencing, alongside innovations like DNA barcoding, metabarcoding, whole genome sequencing and metagenomics, have significantly boosted interest in accessing genetic material. If powerful tools like gene editing, cell cloning, and ex situ propagation and reproduction are also considered, it is clear why there is an increase in the demand for access to genetic material. Vouchering of biomaterials from research projects in a recognised biobank allows both verification of data and further investigation.\n\n\n\nCuration of biomaterials. (© SANBI)",

    "text": "Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa\nThe Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa (BBSA) is a network of biobanks that make biomaterials accessible to external researchers, and that agree to work towards the implementation of common, best practice standards and policies. The BBSA is coordinated by SANBI and is funded through the Department of Science, Technology & Innovation (DSTI), with the participating institutions responsible for funding the routine operations of the biobanks. The aim of the BBSA is to increase the range and quality of biomaterials stored and/or distributed, and increase and improve access for research, conservation and socio-economic development. The objectives include promoting the value of biodiversity biobanks; ensuring a credible, legally compliant and ethical system for collecting, storing and providing access to biomaterials by aligning with standards and procedures set by global and national initiatives and structures; strategic expansion of the biobank holdings; increasing the use and impact of the biomaterials by making inventory data accessible; facilitating training and capacity development, and participation in international networks.\nThere are currently nine institutions (four national science councils, two institutions under a national government department and three universities) participating in the BBSA, collectively with 17 biobanks predominantly focused on indigenous biodiversity and 12 biobanks for crops and livestock and their diseases. These biobanks hold a total of over two million accessions. There are several other biodiversity biobanks in South Africa that are not involved in the BBSA and are associated with individual researchers or units, and there are likely to be vast amounts of biomaterials that have been collected for research projects that are not accessioned into a biobank collection. There is also a substantial quantity of biomaterials originating in South Africa that are held in international biobanks.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

SAIAB, ARC and SANBI have started collecting some eDNA samples, the Plant DNA Biobank at SANBI has been initiated, the ARC has started collecting some terrestrial invertebrate samples, and SAIAB has a number of aquatic invertebrates represented in their biobank. A concerted, strategic effort will be required to ensure that these new biobanks (both infrastructure and holdings) expand at the rate required to allow them to be fully functional within a reasonable timeframe. A full analysis of the sample inventory across biodiversity biobanks is required to assess taxonomic, geographic, temporal and sample type coverage and to use these data to develop a detailed gap analysis to inform an expansion strategy to ensure that the biobanks fully represent South Africa’s biodiversity.",

    "text": "Access to biomaterials for research and development\nIncreasing demand for biobank materials for research purposes is a trend that has been recognised globally, especially for those institutions that have discoverable sample data. This is a positive trend in that it justifies the existence of the biobank, and facilitates research that benefits biodiversity, human health and economic development. Demand must be managed through sound policies that guide decision-making for the use of samples, and recognise that there can be different categories of use depending on the sample status (threat status of species, number of replicates, embargo for current projects) and categories of users and of types of use.\nThe Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation is an international agreement adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The Nagoya Protocol requires that the relevant authority in a signatory country must give Prior Informed Consent (PIC) before genetic resources can be accessed and used, and that there is a Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) agreement between the provider country and the users on the conditions of access and use of the resources and on the benefits to be shared by the two parties. Benefits can be both monetary and non-monetary, with the latter including joint research, training, and sharing of results. At a national level, the Bioprospecting, Access and Benefit Sharing Regulations (2008, amended in 2015)[@governmentofsouthafrica2015] are relevant for bioprospecting and biotrade but also the collection of samples that may have any use for type of biodiscovery or bioprospecting even if this is in future, and the export of samples from South Africa including for purely academic research. There is also legislation for Threatened and Protected Species, provincial legislation for collecting, sharing and exporting biomaterials and requirements for research involving biomaterials originating from animals or micro-organisms under the Animal Disease Control Act (1984). Microbial culture collections need to be registered with the Department of Trade and Industry in terms of the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, 1993 (Act no 87 of 1993). This is a complex regulatory environment that places a significant burden on researchers and on biodiversity biobanks.",

To ensure that these biobanks contribute effectively to the conservation and sustainable use of the country’s biodiversity they need to be recognised as national assets that require sustained investment. Additionally, those responsible for managing them must be aware of global and national developments in data management and access, adhere to standards for sample management, expand both sample holdings and their user base, and actively participate in relevant national and international networks.",

This diversity is a crucial national asset, underpinning strategic objectives across conservation, sustainable resource management, and socio-economic development1. Understanding and documenting biodiversity is therefore essential for informed decision-making, guiding conservation strategies, sectoral policies, and sustainable use of our natural resources to address challenges such as poverty, inequality and unemployment2.\nDespite this, many South African ecosystems and species remain understudied, even as they face growing pressures like habitat loss and fragmentation, unsustainable use, climate change, biological invasions and illegal trade. For numerous species, conservation status remains data deficient or unassessed, complicating efforts to evaluate and mitigate threats. These knowledge gaps are compounded by incomplete taxonomic data, including uncertainties in species classification, identification and distribution across bioregions.\nAn important tool that can assist in addressing these challenges is DNA barcoding, which enables rapid and accurate species identification using standardised genetic markers3,4.

    "text": "South African Barcode of Life (SABOL)\nThe South African Barcode of Life (SABOL) is the national node of the International Barcode of Life Consortium (iBOL). SABOL is funded by the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSI) through the Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP). SABOL promotes DNA barcoding research, addressing gaps in species reference libraries, and consolidates scattered biodiversity data into one comprehensive national resource. DNA barcoding strengthens biodiversity assessments, particularly for cryptic and understudied taxa.\nBetween 2013 and 2022, the FBIP funded 124 DNA barcoding-related projects totalling over R60 million (Figure 1). These efforts align with both international and national obligations, including the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and South Africa’s National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Funds (in millions of South African Rands) awarded per year to biodiversity research through the Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP) between 2013 and 2022. Plot adapted from Kgatla et al. under review.\n\n\n\nA key component of DNA barcoding is the availability of a comprehensive reference library of expertly identified specimens. The Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) serves as a trusted repository for these sequences, ensuring that barcodes meet rigorous quality standards and are derived from taxonomically verified specimens. By providing a reliable foundation for species identification, BOLD underpins SABOL and other national barcoding initiatives, enabling accurate biodiversity assessments and monitoring.",

    "text": "South African barcoding efforts to date\nOver the past decade, South Africa has made significant progress in expanding its faunal DNA barcoding database, particularly for insects and other invertebrates. A 2016 review of DNA barcoding reported that South Africa had contributed approximately 48 000 faunal DNA barcodes to BOLD, representing approximately 2.3% of all known species globally, at the time14.\nSince 2016, contributions to the reference library have grown substantially, with numerous South African researchers and institutions submitting data on indigenous species. As of 28 October 2025, BOLD contains 786 480 sequences (multiple gene sequences for some records), representing 776 512 specimens from South African localities. Approximately, 93% (725 590) of these records are assigned to 59 606 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), which represent OTUs. However, only 94 010 specimen records have been identified to species level, representing 16 425 species (Figure 2). This highlights ongoing needs for taxonomic capacity and expertise.\nThis milestone reflects the collaborative efforts of 284 research institutions, demonstrating the commitment of South Africa’s biodiversity research community to building a comprehensive DNA barcode species reference library. Despite this progress, many of the same challenges first documented nearly a decade ago in the national DNA barcoding review14 remain, including incomplete geographical coverage, taxonomic gaps, limited taxonomic expertise, and the underutilisation of barcode data in conservation and management frameworks14,15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. BIN (Barcode Index Numbers) to species ratio regression analysis. The relationship between the number of BINs assigned to records and the number of species morphologically identified and assigned to species name, with the orange line indicating the 1:1 ratio (BIN to Species).

    "text": "Future directions and recommendations\nA 2025 gap analysis15 indicates that South Africa’s reference library still has taxonomic and geographic gaps, particularly in priority taxa and under-sampled regions (Figure 3). The BIN system relies on multiple sequences per species that capture intraspecific variation across distributions and to improve phylogenetic resolution7. To maximise its effectiveness, future sampling should focus on:\n\nentire species’ ranges, especially for known species that have not yet been barcoded;\nsparsely sampled areas, including biodiversity hotpots and threatened ecosystems;\nunderstudied taxonomic groups, ensuring priority taxa are adequately represented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Proportional representation of taxon groups with BINs in each South African province. Taxon group ‘Fungi’ is excluded because it had no BIN records on BOLD. Category “Other Animals” are species that do not fit into the outlined taxon groups. Category “Other Organisms” are organisms other than animal, plant or fungi (e.g., Protista). Numbers indicate the number of BINs. Map adapted from Kgatla et al. under review.\n\n\n\nCurrently, a significant number of South African records on BOLD remain private while researchers analyse them (Figure 4). While understandable, this can create redundancies and slow the growth of the publicly accessible reference library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Number of South African records on BOLD broken down by public (published) and private (unpublished) records. Graph adapted from Kgatla et al. under review.\n\n\n\nTo address these challenges, it is recommended that DNA barcoding efforts be coordinated and collaborative, ensuring national resources are used efficiently and research gaps are strategically targeted. Establishing a directory of existing barcoding projects and project leaders, alongside regular SABOL-led community meetings and conferences, will strengthen communication and collaboration among institutions.",
