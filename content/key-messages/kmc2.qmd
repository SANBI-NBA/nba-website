\| Investment in biodiversity monitoring is essential to inform effective biodiversity management, decision-making, research and reporting. Without monitoring, there is no way to know if efforts are making a difference or if targets are being met. Yet, data collection and monitoring are under resourced and uncoordinated. Investment in strategic and collaborative biodiversity monitoring will provide the evidence needed to guide adaptive management and ensure resources are used effectively. \| 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

South Africa has several successful citizen science programmes, like the Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, programmes for water resource monitoring, and others, that generate invaluable biodiversity data and foster public engagement. However, gaps remain in the monitoring and detection of changes in species populations, ecological condition and community composition across realms.   

Monitoring allows for a comprehensive understanding of a system or process by tracking trends across time and space. It directly supports decision-makers in identifying emerging issues of concern and adjusting management actions to address these. The collation of data from various field-based monitoring efforts supports reporting on the status of biodiversity at the provincial, national and international scales. Strengthening monitoring mechanisms and coordination will be crucial for driving accountability, transparency, and learning through the revised National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). A robust national biodiversity monitoring framework can play a pivotal role, and its success will depend on: i) the extent to which national indicators comprehensively reflect the goals and targets of both the NBSAP and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; ii) the degree to which the three spheres of government, non-state actors, and other stakeholders actively adopt and apply the national monitoring system in planning and reporting; and iii) the accessibility and openness of biodiversity data and metadata ensuring that information is shared widely, used meaningfully, and contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of South Africa’s biodiversity. 

Biodiversity monitoring can be advanced by investment in innovative technology and data science. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, are particularly useful for unobtrusively monitoring vast, inaccessible areas. Artificial intelligence can process and analyse large volumes of data to identify subtle changes in real-time, allowing for more proactive responses to emerging pressures. Biodiversity monitoring should also align with global best practices and build on existing international monitoring initiatives. Partnering with international institutions and initiatives will enable enhanced technical support, harmonised data collection standards, access to advanced technologies, and invaluable insights into the creation of data processing workflows. Monitoring should continue to harness the value of citizen science, which reduces data collection costs while increasing the scale of data collection. Citizen science has the added benefit of empowering individuals to contribute to conservation efforts and strengthening community involvement in addressing global challenges like climate change. Citizen science programmes require constant fund raising and awareness building, and coordinated campaigns to secure these efforts are essential.
