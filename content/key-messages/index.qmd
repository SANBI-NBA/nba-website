## Overview

The **NBA 2025 Key messages** distil some of the most important findings of NBA 2025 in a way that is accessible to various audiences.

Each message includes a summary paragraph with a confidence statement. The messages draw on evidence from NBA analyses (e.g., Red List status, ecological condition), explain, **why this matters** (e.g., consequences for people), and point to **practical actions, responses, and interventions** that can be taken.

The NBA provides a **summary of the state of biodiversity at a point in time**. It cannot list every action or intervention; instead, it serves as a **strategic tool** that should stimulate discussions among stakeholders and inform sector specific strategies and action plans, cross-sectoral planning, research strategies, scenario planning, and co-produced response strategies that follow from the NBA.

## How to use these messages

-   Read each key message with its **underlying data** and analyses.

-   Use them to inform **sector strategies, cross-sector planning, research, scenario planning,** and **implementation roadmaps.**

-   Treat confidence statements as guidance on **certainty, evidence quality,** and **agreement.**
