*The 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment identified key marine ecosystems, species and benefits at risk, and knowledge gaps limiting the assessment. Priority actions to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods were co-developed in collaboration with knowledge holders and decision makers. Advancing these priority actions can help to improve the state of marine biodiversity and maintain its many benefits to South Africans.*

## Knowledge progress and gaps

During the 2025 assessment of threat status and protection level of marine ecosystems and species, many research gaps that limit the assessment of marine biodiversity emerged. Knowledge gaps identified in the 2018 assessment [@sink2019c] were also revisited and progress against these were briefly evaluated to identify persistent knowledge gaps (Table 1). Persistent knowledge gaps and research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in more equitable marine protection [ecosystem protection level page](marine_epl.qmd).

![Improving the knowledge base to support inclusion of [underwater noise](#box-3) in marine biodiversity assessment and planning is a key research priority with some progress underway. Species groups such as marine mammals are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic underwater noise, affecting life functions. (© Geoff Spiby)](imgs/Marine%20mammals%20are%20sensitive%20to%20underwater%20noise_Geoff%20Spiby.jpg)

Some progress is evident in the research priorities identified in the previous NBA (Table 1). Key areas of progress include foundational biodiversity science for species (Box 1) and [ecosystems](marine_ecosystems.qmd#sec-updatingMEM), research on the impacts of demersal trawling (Atkinson et al. In prep, Rylands 2024), climate change [(Porter, other heatwaves?)]{.mark}, improved understanding of underwater noise (Box 2), and research to support groundtruthing of marine ecological condition [@smit2023; @smit2024; @smit2026].

![Citizen scientists have advanced the taxonomy and distribution records for nudibranchs and produced a beautiful publication that makes this information accessible. (© Georgina Jones)](imgs/nudibranch_georgina_jones.jpg)

Progress in taxonomic knowledge include the description of 868 species of sea slugs known to the southern African region and the publication of a field guide outlining their distribution and engaging illustrations to enable easy identification in the field (Gosliner et al. 2024).

Taxonomic descriptions of 170 southern African sea cucumbers species were published, representing 55 years of research, and calling for increased efforts to further build taxonomic capacity in southern Africa (Thandar 2022). The state of knowledge of South African azooxanthellate coral species has been improved, with the total number of known species increased from 77 to 108, with 28 new species records, three new species and one new genus (Filander et al 2021).
:::

Little progress has been made on redlisting of marine species and no progress has been made in terms of evaluating species protection levels in the marine realm although research to evaluate potential increases in protection level of the African penguin is underway. Progress has been made in developing standardised monitoring approaches for early detection of marine invasive alien species (Loureiro et al 2021) but gaps remain in establishing rapid response mechanisms once species are detected.

## Knowledge gaps limiting species and ecosystem assessment

Ongoing challenges in assessing marine species, genetic biodiversity and ecosystems include the crises in taxonomy and a poor understanding of species distribution data (Table 1). Innovative and integrated methods that can help address these gaps include imaging approaches, molecular methods, digital taxonomy, active and passive acoustics, citizen science and the strategic connection of biodiversity databases (Rogers et al, 2022). Progress in these complementary areas can increase our understanding of species distribution and feed into improved marine biodiversity assessment at all levels (genetic, species and ecosystems) and multiple scales. Foundational data gaps and capacity constraints limit the IUCN Red List assessment (extinction risk) of marine species. Although dedicated marine species red listing support has been recognised as a key need since 2008 (Sink et al. 2019 chapter 11 prev NBA), there has been no progress in securing resources or capacity to advance this work (Subramoney et al. 2024).

South Africa has made progress in adopting the four Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework genetic indicators, however marine invertebrate taxa are still neglected. A national genetics monitoring framework is still lacking and the integration of genetic/genomic data into marine spatial plans.

Challenges in measuring ecosystem condition and developing agreed thresholds of collapse for different ecosystem functional groups include capacity gaps, data and monitoring gaps and conceptual challenges with the need to apply a greater diversity of indicators to this end.

Groundtruthing ecosystem types remains crucial for ongoing improvement of their descriptions and delineations. For example, the marine realm uses techniques such as remote operated vehicle surveys and seabed sampling (e.g. by grab samples, research trawls and sleds) to collect information on biotic components of ecosystem types; while abiotic data like bathymetry, water turbidity, productivity data and sediments also contribute to ecosystem classification. Progress in work to strengthen the classification and delineation of marine ecosystem types is detailed on the Marine Ecosystem types page.

## Priority actions for improving the state of marine biodiversity

Drawing from the key findings of NBA 2025, several priority actions were co-developed to improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). More than 80 individual actions were co-developed and classified into ten broad thematic areas with more detailed recommended steps and potential indicators of progress for each action. These are not comprehensive, prescriptive or time bound but include specific and measurable elements, where possible, to more easily track progress. Each of the 10 actions were linked to relevant Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets (box 3) to easily inform ongoing policy processes. The marine assessment team will evaluate progress for these recommended steps in future assessments.

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is a global agreement under the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), which South Africa has formally committed to. The framework has four goals and 23 targets for protecting, conserving and restoring biodiversity. South Africa is in the process of domesticating the GBF targets and aligning its national strategies to achieve these ambitious targets. Whilst aimed at improving biodiversity, the framework elevates the importance of indigenous, peoples and local communities, and seeks to enhance the role this important stakeholder group plays in protecting and managing biodiversity now and in further. Further details are available in the [2030 targets](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets).

<!-- ## 1. Enable broader participation in ocean planning, assessment, management and governance (Key messages [C1](../key-messages/kmc1.qmd) and [B4](../key-messages/kmb4.qmd)). -->

Enable participation in ocean planning, assessment and management to support a whole-of-society approach for effective ocean governance. This can be advanced through robust and inclusive stakeholder processes, strengthened capacity for social process across institutions and innovations in industry and community partnerships. (Key messages [C1](../key-messages/kmc1.qmd), [B4](../key-messages/kmb4.qmd)) (GBF 1, 3, 9, 10, 19, 21, 22, 23)

![](imgs/gbf_pa1.png)

Potential indicators of progress could include:

-   New or strengthened fora, collectives and platforms are established or revived through which government institutions can actively engage communities, civil society, industry and non-profit organisations with a focus on indigenous peoples, women and youth, heritage institutions, small-scale fishers, traditional leaders, traditional healers, and other traditional and local knowledge holders on matters related to ocean planning, management, development and decision-making.

-   Indigenous knowledge working groups are established with co-developed guidelines and outputs that support the recognition and inclusion of indigenous knowledge in marine biodiversity assessment, planning and decision-making. Identify and establish mechanisms for integrating Indigenous knowledge into existing and new management plans, actions, and policies and other outputs and outcomes related to planning, management, and decision-making.

-   National and local small-scale fisheries priority areas maps are developed and validated through processes that prioritise and actively involve indigenous people and small-scale fishing communities to represent the spatial interests of this vulnerable sector in national ocean planning and decision-making processes.

-   There is an increase in the number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with active and representative local stakeholder fora. In 2025 only x (%) of South Africa’s MPAs have active MPA fora, advisory groups or Protected Area Advisory Committees (PAACs).

-   There is financial and logistical support to enable meaningful participation of previously marginalised small-scale fishing coastal communities and knowledge holders in participatory processes and the formats, venue and language used support active participation.

Simplify, strengthen and co-ordinate institutional and sectoral arrangements, relationships and frameworks to enable a whole-of government approach for effective and efficient ocean planning and governance. This can be advanced through improved coordination, clear roles and responsibilities and more integrated spatial planning and ecosystem-based management. (GBF 14, 20 and 21)
:::
:::::

Potential indicators of progress could include:

-   Marine inter-governmental and cross-sectoral site-specific working groups and task teams are reviewed with steps taken to clarify, simplify, streamline workstreams and enhance efficiency.

-   Improved communication and coordination between government departments and agencies responsible for fishing rights allocation, small-scale fisheries, ocean conservation and co-management.

-   Co-ordinated engagement and problem solving to address the persistent challenges facing small-scale fishers including issues related to permitting, rights allocation, MPAs and co-management.

-   Structures and processes to advance ecosystem-based management (including ecosystem-based fisheries management and better consideration of cumulative impacts) are established with holistic recommendations co-developed and implemented for integrated management.

-   There is progress in cross sectoral biodiversity prioritisation (working with sectors such as heritage, fisheries and tourism) to support implementation of integrated biodiversity-inclusive marine spatial planning.

-   Marine biodiversity priorities and ecosystem based management are integrated in the environmental screening tool that supports environmental impact assessments.

-   Improved co-ordination facilitates an integrated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure to secure vital fresh-water flows to the marine realm.

-   An overarching framework for integrated shark management (considering fisheries, conservation, tourism and trade) is developed and its implementation is initiated. Progress could be measured in species level fisheries data for cartilaginous fishes, bycatch reduction in industrial fisheries, reduction of recreational fisheries pressure on sharks and rays, effective spatial protection, further reduction in the impacts of lethal shark control measures and strengthened cooperative analyses of the impact of trade.

![](imgs/gbf_pa3.png)

Potential indicators of progress can include:

-   Critical Biodiversity Areas and Sea-Use guidelines are mainstreamed within key production sectors and included in screening tools used for Environmental Impact Assessments.

-   The location of new ports and harbours are carefully considered, avoid critical biodiversity areas and implemented with effective mitigation measures.

-   Resources and research capacity for improved understanding of underwater noise impacts and cumulative impacts on marine biodiversity are leveraged, so that these impacts are better accounted for in biodiversity assessments, Marine Spatial Planning, mining authorizations and protected area management.

-   Innovative finance tools in South Africa are piloted to demonstrate how industrial sectors can fund marine conservation rehabilitation/ restoration (e.g., marine biodiversity offsets, polluter pay).

-   The Ballast Water Act, which has been in Bill form since 2013, is promulgated by South Africa and implemented with the associated regulations and compliance systems.

-   New marine mainstreaming initiatives are developed and implemented to reduce pollution (including underwater noise), seabed and shore damage and impacts on threatened marine species. These could include scaled-up incentives for sustainable use and conservation through eco-certification and other mechanisms.

-   Industrial impacts in MPAs are reduced and conservation expansion efforts are contributing to the protection of traditional fishing grounds and marine resources and reduced conflict between sectors.

<!-- ## 4. Ensure sufficient quantity and quality of freshwater flows to marine ecosystems (Key message A3, A7, B2). -->

South Africa needs to ensure that sufficient fresh water is allocated and received by the marine realm and that water quality is improved to maintain benefits for coastal ecosystems, species and people. (Key messages [A3](../key-messages/kma3.qmd), [A7](../key-messages/kma7.qmd), [B2](../key-messages/kmb2.qmd)) (GBF 7, 10, 11, 14)

![](imgs/gbf_pa4.png)

Potential indicators of progress could include:

-   A lead department is assigned to coordinate and ensure that flow requirements for fluvially dependent marine ecosystems and resources are determined and secured.

-   A method for determining flow requirements is officially accepted and adopted as a standard protocol.

-   Priority catchments are identified and communicated in the next version of the NBA, with progress in holistic catchment management to support improved quality and quantity of fresh water reaching the sea.

-   Marine flow requirements have been recognised in legislation and integrated into water resource management, coastal management and marine living resource management processes.

-   New collaborations and partnerships have been established between existing initiatives to catalyse better co-ordination and have greater impact with reducing the amount of pollution and litter reaching the sea.

-   Coastal sewerage infrastructure is upgraded and maintained to ensure sustainable sewage management that reduces contamination by bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, chemicals and improves coastal water quality.

-   Effective measures are developed and implemented to minimize solid waste, plastics, and microplastics entering the marine environment from rivers, stormwater outlets, outfalls and other sources.

-   Ecosystem condition and threat status of fluvially dependent marine ecosystems improves in the long term.

Strengthen ecosystem-based fisheries management through periodic reviews and updates to ecological risk assessments, development and implementation of effective fisheries management plans, and increased biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries. (Key messages [A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd), [A5](../key-messages/kma5.qmd), [B1](../key-messages/kmb1.qmd), [B3](../key-messages/kmb3.qmd), [B5](../key-messages/kmb5.qmd)) (GBF 10, 22, 23)

![](imgs/gbf_pa5.png)

Potential indicators of progress could include:

-   Fisheries management plans for fishing sectors are developed to ensure ecological sustainability for long term economic sustainability. These should ensure resource (target species) sustainability, include bycatch and habitat management objectives (where applicable), address the human dimensions of fisheries, and include climate change considerations.

-   A bycatch management strategy is developed and implemented to improve fisheries sustainability, reduce inter-sector conflict and support fair fisheries.

-   The Linefish & Netfish Scientific Working Group’s 2015 recommendations are implemented.

-   Ecological Risk Assessments are reviewed and key steps to avoid and mitigate ecosystem risks are identified with actions initiated to address risks.

-   Illegal harvesting of abalone and West Coast rock lobster is reduced with evidence of resource recovery.

-   There is progress in electronic monitoring of fisheries including the piloting of electronic logbooks.

-   Traditional fishing practices have been respected and safeguarded from industrial maritime sectors (industrial fisheries impacts), through the prioritisation of such practices in MPA design and expansion.

-   Recreational fisheries management is reformed to improve fisheries sustainability and enable holistic management and equitable marine resource sharing across fishing sectors:

    -   The Marine Living Resources Act is amended to facilitate rapid regulatory changes (size limit, bag limit, closed season, prohibited species) to ensure timely responses to critical marine resource issues.⁠

    -   A proportion of recreational angling license funding is secured for recreational fisheries monitoring, compliance, assessment and stakeholder engagement (through the establishment of a representative peak body) to ensure that these essential governance activities are sufficiently funded.⁠

    -   A transdisciplinary recreational fisheries monitoring strategy is co-developed to effectively address the lack of catch and effort data in the fishery, to improve the evidence for informed decision making and equitable marine resource sharing with the small-scale fishery sector.

    -   A multifaceted (normative and instrumental) recreational fisheries compliance strategy is co-developed with stakeholders.

    -   Levels of non-compliance are reduced due to outreach initiatives, implementation of compliance strategy, increased legitimacy of fisheries regulations and mainstreaming within the recreational fisheries sector.

Equitable management and sharing of limited fishing resources between sectors is critical to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods. The establishment of small-scale fishing zones could safeguard traditional fishing practices and might be explored as a mechanism for OECM recognition led by fishers.

![](imgs/gbf_pa6.png)

Potential indicators of progress could include:

-   Organisations tasked with design, implementation and management of marine protected and conserved areas and spatial fisheries management have capacity for social science research, social learning facilitation and community development.

-   Clear and specific gazetted MPA objectives that encompass both biodiversity conservation, cultural heritage and socio-economic considerations are established through retrospective reviews for MPAs lacking clear purposes.

-   Outdated MPA regulations are reviewed and updated to align with current conservation and management objectives and align with newer regulations.

-   A formal definition, common understanding, and practical framework for “co-management” in an MPA-specific context is co-developed and harmonised with co-existing contexts (e.g., Fisheries).

-   Small-scale fishing zones are co-designed and implemented and explored for recognition as Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs) with leadership from small-scale fishers. This could provide protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding vulnerable fishers, marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.

-   Other new spatial measures to conserve natural and cultural heritage are piloted and evaluated for recognition as OECMs.

-   Innovative sustainable finance mechanisms to support long-term comprehensive operational funding for MPAs are piloted.

-   Local stewardship by indigenous people, youth and local communities is actively promoted, incentivised and enabled.

-   Capacity for collaborative monitoring, surveillance and compliance in and around MPAs is improved through adequate funding, new partnerships (including community collaborations) and innovative technology.

-   Offshore protection levels are improved, in particular for slope ecosystem types.

-   The spatial protection of threatened sharks and rays, seabreams and kobs (genus *Argyrosomus*) is improved, especially within vulnerable aggregation sites, nursery areas and bycatch hotspots.

-   New paths, initiatives and partnerships provide socio-economic benefits to coastal communities adjacent to existing and new marine and coastal conservation areas to offset foregone opportunity costs, particularly for those most vulnerable.

::: {#box .callout .marine collapse="false"}
## Explainer: Natural capital accounting

Economic growth is intrinsically linked to environmental benefits, and studies have shown that environmental degradation can have far reaching implications for economic activity and human health [@acheampong2023]. The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework [@unitednations2014] was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.

Natural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy [@costanza2011; @costanza1997; @stebbings2021].

Through the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.

## Approach

### Priority actions

Drawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 70 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 70 priority actions, a set of 10 key overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended sub-actions which if implemented could make marine biodiversity better in the water. Drawing from the more specific recommended actions, specific and measurable indicators of progress per action were co-developed.
