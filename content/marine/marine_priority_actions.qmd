*The 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment identified key marine ecosystems, species and benefits at risk, and knowledge gaps limiting the assessment. Priority actions to safeguard ocean life and livelihoods were co-developed in collaboration with knowledge holders and decision makers. Advancing these priority actions can help to improve the state of marine biodiversity and maintain its many benefits to South Africans.*

## Knowledge progress and gaps

During the assessment of threat status and protection level of marine ecosystems and species, many research gaps emerged that limit the assessment of marine biodiversity. The [2018 assessment](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12143/6372) also identified knowledge gaps and progress against these research priorities [@sink2019a] [was briefly evaluated (Table / Box x)]{.mark}. Persistent research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in equitable protection (Ecosystem protection level).

## Priority actions

Drawing from the key findings of this assessment, a number of priority actions were co-developed to improve the state of marine biodiversity in South Africa (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). More than 70 individual actions were co-developed and these were classified into ten broad thematic areas of action with more detailed recommended steps and indicators for each action in order to track progress.

::: {#box-1 .callout-note .freshwater collapse="false"}
## 1. Enable civil society participation in ocean planning, assessment, management and governance (Key messages [C1](../key-messages/kmc1.qmd) and [B4](../key-messages/kmb4.qmd)).

Enable participation in ocean planning, assessment and management to support a whole-of-society approach for effective ocean governance. This can be advanced through robust and inclusive stakeholder processes, strengthened capacity for social process across institutions and innovations in industry and community partnerships.

-   Establish a National Ocean People’s Forum through which government institutions can actively engage indigenous peoples, traditional leaders, traditional healers, small-scale fishers (including women and youth) and traditional knowledge holders on matters related to ocean planning and decision-making.

-   Indigenous knowledge working group/s established and guideline developed to support the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in ocean assessment, planning and decision making.

-   Co-develop a national small-scale fisheries priority areas map to represent the spatial interests of this vulnerable sector in national planning and decision making processes.

## 8. Ensure that existing Marine Protected Areas work and expand South Africa’s conservation estate through new approaches, co-management and co-ordinated efforts to address persistent challenges (Key message B4, Key message C1, and Key message C3).

-   Improve marine protection through more diverse and inclusive conservation models, improved social process and innovative finance; progress in co-management and steps to address critical capacity shortfalls and restorative action. Persistent barriers to effective protection must be overcome and key lessons in this process should be applied in future expansion efforts.

-   Organisations tasked with design, implementation and management of marine protected and conserved areas and spatial fisheries management have capacity for social science research, social learning facilitation and community development.

-   Ensure that all MPAs have clear and specific objectives that encompass both biodiversity conservation and socio-economic considerations, which will require retrospective reviews for MPAs with unclear purposes.

-   A formal definition, common understanding, and practical framework for co-management in an MPA-specific context is co-developed.

-   At least one small-scale fishing zone is co-designed and implemented and explored for recognition as an OECM with leadership from small-scale fishers. This can provide protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding vulnerable fishers, marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.

-   Pilot sustainable innovative finance mechanism to support long-term comprehensive operational funding for MPAs and incentivise local stewardship by indigenous people, youth and local communities.

## 9. Maintain and increase marine biodiversity benefits through improved statistics, communication and knowledge sharing (Key message C1, Key message C2, Key message C3).

Diversify and improve the communication of marine biodiversity data (values and benefits, risks, usage), and mainstream biodiversity into key production sectors (especially fisheries). This will enable better understanding of the value of marine biodiversity and its contribution to the economy.

-   A new product is co-developed to make the case for the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries.

-   Communication efforts are underway to reduce the risk of marine invasives.

-   Marine needs identified and communicated to Statistics South Africa to support data collection for new statistics that support effective communication of the value of marine biodiversity to the economy.

-   First set of marine and coastal natural capital accounts published.

::: {#box .callout .box-within-box collapse="false"}
## Explainer: Natural capital accounting

Economic growth is intrinsically linked to environmental benefits, and studies have shown that environmental degradation can have far reaching implications for economic activity and human health (Acheampong & Opoku, 2023). The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework (United Nations et al., 2014) was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.

Natural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy (Costanza et al., 1997, 2011; Stebbings et al., 2021).

Through the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.

## Approach

### Priority actions

Drawing from the key findings of this assessment, more than 70 priority actions were co-developed to improve the condition of marine ecosystems and species, and to safeguard the many benefits they provide. To inform these actions, a series of science–policy-society engagements were held, bringing together researchers, decision-makers, civil society and knowledge holders (with a particular focus on coastal communities) to review research evidence and jointly co-develop recommendations to address key findings, identified risks and key pressures on South Africa’s marine biodiversity (Sink et al. 2023, Rylands et al. 2025, van der Bank et al. 2025). From the more than 70 priority actions, a set of 10 key overarching priority actions were distilled with recommended sub-actions which if implemented could make marine biodiversity better in the water. Drawing from the more specific recommended actions, specific and measurable indicators of progress per action were co-developed.
