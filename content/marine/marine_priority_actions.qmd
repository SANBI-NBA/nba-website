## Co-developed Actions to improve the state of marine ecosystems

**(72 actions in ten categories)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#box-1 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Enable participation in ocean assessment, planning and management

Enable participation in ocean planning, assessment and management through robust and inclusive stakeholder processes, strengthened capacity for social process across institutions and innovations in industry and community partnerships.

-   Establish a National Ocean People’s Forum through which government institutions can actively engage indigenous peoples, traditional leaders, traditional healers, small-scale fishers (including women and youth) and traditional knowledge holders on matters related to ocean planning and decision making.

-   Ensure that at least 50% of South Africa’s marine protected areas have established and active local MPA Fora.

-   Develop guidelines and pilot the inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge in South Africa’s National Biodiversity Assessment.

-   Co-develop a national small-scale fisheries priority areas map to represent the spatial interests of this vulnerable sector in national planning and decision making processes.

::: {#box-2 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Take a whole of society and whole of government approach for effective ocean governance (improve co-ordination)

Streamline, strengthen and co-ordinate institutional and sectoral arrangements, relationships and frameworks for integrated, efficient and effective ocean governance.

-   Leverage momentum of the National Ocean People’s Forum (to be established) to strengthen stakeholder dialogue and participation in the development of MSP sector plans (including but not limited to sector plans for biodiversity, fisheries, heritage and tourism).

-   Ensure all government institutions with ocean interests or impacts participate in WG7 (Ocean Governance) with clear institutional reporting modalities identified.

::: {#box-3 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Avoid, reduce and manage industrial impacts

Avoid, reduce and manage industrial impacts on marine biodiversity through effective Marine Spatial Planning, strengthened mitigation and restoration (including water quality and underwater noise), and strategic mainstreaming within key production sectors.

-   Mainstream Critical Biodiversity Areas and Sea-Use guidelines within production sectors and ensure that these are included in screening tools used for Environmental Impact Assessments.

-   Leverage resources and research capacity for improved understanding of the impacts of underwater noise and cumulative impacts on marine biodiversity so that these can be accounted for in biodiversity assessments, Marine Spatial Planning and mining authorizations.

-   Pilot at least one innovative finance tool in South Africa which demonstrates how industrial sectors can fund marine conservation and restoration (e.g., marine biodiversity offsets, polluter pay).

::: {#box-4 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Improve water quality and ensure enough fresh water reaches the sea.

-   Lead department established to coordinate and ensure that flow requirements for fluvially dependent marine ecosystems and resources are determined and secured.

-   Method for determining flow requirements is officially accepted and adopted as a standard protocol.

-   Priority catchments are identified and communicated in next NBA.

-   Marine flow requirements recognised in legislation and integrated into water resource management, coastal management and living resource management processes.

## Manage fisheries better and more fairly to improve ocean health and food and livelihood security.

::: {#box-6 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Improve social and natural science monitoring and research.

Catalyse research and monitoring to address critical social and natural science knowledge gaps that limit the assessment of marine biodiversity, the identification of joint solutions and decision-making for a sustainable oceans economy.

-   Identify and map noise sensitive species and ecosystems so that these can be better included in biodiversity assessment and spatial prioritisations.

-   Secure dedicated capacity to advance redlist assessments of marine species.

-   Groundtruth South Africa’s ecosystem condition map in at least two new ecosystem functional groups.

-   Pilot at least one participatory and interdisciplinary fisheries monitoring initiative in South Africa (preferably for near shore resources).

::: {#box-7 .callout-note collapse="true"}
## Ensure South Africa has the skills and infrastructure to manage and deliver expanding data and knowledge products for informed ocean planning and decision-making.

Invest in data science capacity and infrastructure to ensure effective data pipelines that integrate and update strategic analyses in a transparent way to support informed ocean decision-making. Strengthened capacity and infrastructure is needed for all organisations tasked with mapping, assessing, monitoring, and providing indicators and data products that inform management of marine biodiversity, fisheries and the ocean.

-   Data managers, data scientists and spatial analysts are part of the staff complement of organizations tasked with mapping, assessing, monitoring, and providing indicators and data products that inform management of marine biodiversity, fisheries and the ocean.

-   Researchers and key staff are trained in relevant data science tools, data standards and reproducible workflows.

-   Organisational data infrastructure, IT policies and capacity are enabling for effective database storage, curation and data sharing.

-   FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and reproducible science workflows are prioritised.
