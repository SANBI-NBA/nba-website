## Summary

South Africa’s marine environment includes the Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans with the contrasting cold Benguela upwelling region and the warm, fast flowing Agulhas current (Figure 1) interacting with the diverse geological setting and topography (Figure 2) to drive exceptional marine biodiversity. The marine realm around mainland South Africa extends from the dune base to a depth of about 5 500 m. The broad range of oceanographic, climatic and geological settings result in a high diversity of marine ecosystem types around mainland South Africa. Globally, South Africa is reported to have the third highest marine endemism with an estimated 33% of its marine fauna found only in South Africa. There is particularly high marine endemism in the warm temperate Agulhas region that extends from False Bay in Cape Town to the transition area near East London and extends offshore on the Agulhas Bank. The 2025 assessment uses the 163 marine ecosystem types as mapped in the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map (Figure 3). These ecosystems are nested within 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups in alignment with the [IUCN global ecosystem typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/).

In the past five years, a substantial amount of data have been collated to improve marine ecosystem mapping and South Africa has shared lessons on our approach of iterative improvements in ecosystem classification and mapping ([\@sink2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.1108118)). Recent advancements include a new 100-m^2^ resolution national bathymetry map (Manikam et al. 2023), a 600% increase in sediment records and interpolated sediment maps sourced from [dbSEABED](https://instaar.colorado.edu/~jenkinsc/dbseabed/), multiple new oceanographic layers and a cumulative marine biodiversity data set spanning \>1.8 million records, \>7 000 species and \> 100 000 unique localities from more than 125 years of marine science efforts. [(Kelp map published Dunga et al. 2024) Luther AI? Cite reference image report Figure x.]{.mark} Investment in greater research and data science capacity enable such advancements that will improve marine ecosystem classification and mapping, spatial biodiversity assessment and management advice.

There is rapid escalation in the variety and volume of marine data that monitor biodiversity and environmental conditions and that can be used to characterise patterns, habitats and ecosystems in the ocean. In recognition of this escalation of data, SANBI is implementing data science tools, workflows and statistical approaches for delineating and describing marine ecosystem types[@dunga2024]. Like its predecessors, the 2023 marine ecosystem map relied heavily on thematic approaches and expert-informed decision-making. The updated approach is to develop a framework of data-ingesting and analytical workflows that are reproducible, can be improved as new data or better methods become available, and can be maintained through turnover in staff and guiding experts. The new way of working aims for effectively curated data structures, accessed, manipulated and analysed with scripted workflows, which are documented in online repositories. These repositories ease collaboration and version control and can be shared in publication of the results or products, enhancing transparency of the methods.
