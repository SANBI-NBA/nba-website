*There is progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs, which reveal gaps in participation, ecosystem protection,  connectivity and governance. Diversified conservation measures can help address gaps and provide new opportunities to contribute to cultural heritage protection. Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected with a need to improve the condition of marine ecosystems in conservation areas. South Africa needs to better include people in the design, implementation and co-management of conservation areas.*

## Ecosystem protection level results

Of South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, 83% have some representation in the MPA network but only 32 ecosystem types (20%) are Well Protected. Twenty seven ecosystem types (17%) are Not Protected. Note that relative to the previous assessment, these changes are due to differences in targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. 

South Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the Phakisa Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) network (Sink et al. 2023) with no progress in protection since 2019. New work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective Conservation Measures which may help diversify protection models (Kirkman et al. in press).

Of the 83 ecosystem types that were Not Protected in 2018, 67 types received their first protection in 2019, including 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types in 2019. In 2019, an additional 18 ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected with a total of 20% of ecosystem types now falling within this category. 

Ecosystem types on the KwaZulu-Natal shelf generally have higher protection levels and ecosystem types in the Southern Benguela are the least protected (@fig-epl_map_benthic). Protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves, but the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened.

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (@fig-epl_bargraphs). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement. Restoration and strengthened ecosystem management in protected areas can provide an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected.

![An excellent area to improve protection of the Poorly Protected Eastern Agulhas Outer Shelf Mosaic is in the Seaview Horse Mussel Seabed Management Area near Gqeberha. This area has high biodiversity and Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys found clumps of horse mussels that were not observed in areas with more inshore trawling activity © ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink.](imgs/Seaview_Horse_mussels.jpg)


Ecosystem types that are Not Protected include the Kingklip Koppies, the vast Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope, the expansive Southwest Indian Lower slope and  four pelagic ecosystem types. Among the latter, the Agulhas Retroflection and Southern Ocean Transitional Water is of particular interest as a globally unique area. The uThukela Canyon, the Cape Lower Canyon and St Helena Bay are also Not Protected.

![Submarine canyons cut into the continental slope off South Africa’s western margin. The Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope and the Cape Lower Canyon are both Not Protected. ](imgs/canyons_map.png)


Poorly Protected Ecosystem Types include several types that fall into this category because of high levels of ecosystem modification within protected areas. These include Agulhas and Cape Kelp Forests and Cape Bay and False and Walker Bay. Other ecosystem types that could advance from  their current Poorly Protected status to Moderately Protected through improved ecological condition include Agulhas Mid Shelf Reef, the Agulhas Coarse Sediment Shelf Edge and Amathole Lace Corals.

![Protection level of Cape Kelp Forest can improve from the current Poorly Protected Status with improvement in ecological condition through more effective management of pressures. © Geoff Spiby](imgs/Oudekraal_snorkel_1009_037.jpg)


Forty eight marine ecosystem types are Moderately Protected. Several of these could advance to Well Protected through improved ecological condition but 27 types will require increased coverage in MPAs or OECMs.  For example Agulhas Boulder Shore, Agulhas Rocky Plateau and Agulhas Upper Canyon can improve protection level with increased representation in South Africa’s marine conservation estate. (Tash I cant find any types that dropped from WP to MP because of condition but I think we have some- lets check and add a sentence and flagship type).

![ Agulhas Boulder Shore is currently Moderately Protected and needs increased coverage in protected or conserved area to advance to Well Protected. This could be achieved adjacent to the Agulhas National Park © ](imgs/)


Agulhas Boulder Shore requires increased representation in South Africa network of protected and conserved areas to advance to Well Protected.

Only 20% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types are Well Protected with poor ecological condition in many protected areas being part of this challenge. Well Protected ecosystem types include many from the Delagoa ecoregion where the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area and World Heritage Site provides protection to many ecosystem types. Agulhas Inner Shelf Reef,  Natal Exposed Rocky Shore and seamount ecosystem types in the South east Atlantic are other examples of Well Protected types.
