## Summary

Of South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, 83% have some representation in the MPA network but only 32 ecosystem types (20%) are Well Protected. Twenty seven ecosystem types (16%) are Not Protected. Note that relative to the previous assessment, these changes are due to differences in targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. South Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the Phakisa Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) network with no progress in protection since 2019. New work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective Conservation Measures which may help diversify protection models.

There is progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs, which reveal gaps in participation, cultural heritage protection, connectivity and governance limiting progress in protection. Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement with a need to better include people in the design, implementation and co-management of conservation areas.

## Ecosystem porotection level results

The 2025 Ecosystem Protection Level assessment for the marine realm found that 83% of marine ecosystem types have some representation in the MPA network but only 20% of ecosystem types (32 types) are Well Protected. Twenty seven ecosystem types (17%) are Not Protected.

Of the 70 ecosystem types that were Not Protected in 2018, 58 (check) received their first protection, including 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types in 2019. In 2019, an additional x (used to be 17) ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected with a total of 20% of ecosystem types now falling within this category.

Ecosystem types on the KwaZulu-Natal shelf generally have higher protection levels and ecosystem types in the Southern Benguela are the least protected (Figure 3). Protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves, but the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened.

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (Figures 4 and 5). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement.

There is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through ecosystem restoration and strengthened MPA management to reduce ecosystem degradation. Additional offshore MPAs will need to be established to represent ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected.

There is progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs (Kirkman et al al. 2021, 2023, Mann Lang et al. 2021). These studies reveal gaps in connectivity, participation, cultural heritage protection and governance which limit progress in protection. Ecological effectiveness of MPAs…An evaluation of socio-economic effectiveness….Governance effectiveness (Stephen).

Overall, it is increasingly evident that MPAs won't work if they don’t consider and involve people and address issues that undermine their legitimacy and effectiveness. Other Effective Conservation Measures offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection ( cite Kirkman et al in review ?link). (more text)

Photo – St Francis compilation. Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys within the trawl closure off Cape St Francis suggest that this area has biodiversity value and could be evaluated as a potential Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measure (OECM) which, if recognized as an OECM, could contribute to improved ecosystem protection levels for the Endangered and Not Protected Easten Agulhas Bay.

## Ecosystem protection level approach

The history and approach to the development of South Africa’s protection level assessment is explained on the [EPL explanation page](epl_explain.qmd). The 2025 Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets (with the methodology shown in Figure 2 eg old fig 91). While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% marine target with an additional rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target for all ecosystem types. In order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected. As such changes in EPL between 2018 and 2025 are non-genuine and are driven by the increased target and improved methodology rather than changes in protection or ecological condition. Note that Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) will contribute to ecosystem protection once these have been recognised in the marine realm (?WWF links?).

In 2018, South Africa had 25 coastal Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) covering less than 0.6% of the ocean around South Africa (6 260 km2), up from 0.4% (4 711 km2) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly between 2018 and 2019 and now covers 5.4% of the ocean around South Africa (51 477 km2) (Figure 1). No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019 and no marine areas have been recognised as Other Effective Conservation Measures in the marine realm as of December 2025. A map of the 41 MPAs around South Africa is shown in Figure 1, noting that the Prince Edward island MPA in South Africa’s subantarctic territory (link to chapter subantarctic) is the biggest of the South African MPAs and lies more than 1700 km south of Gqeberha.
