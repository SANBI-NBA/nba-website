*Progress has been made in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Advances in ecological effectiveness are evident but there are gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity and governance. Increasing extent of protection alone is not enough to advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected, as the condition of marine ecosystems in conservation areas also needs to be improved. Diversified conservation measures can help address gaps and provide new opportunities to safeguard both biodiversity and cultural heritage. South Africa needs to better include people in the design, implementation and co-management of conservation areas.*

## Ecosystem protection level results

Of South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, `r perc_protected_count`% (representing `r perc_protected_extent`% of the mainland marine area) are represented in the MPA network to some degree, leaving 27 ecosystem types (17%) as Not Protected (representing `r perc_np_extent`% of the mainland marine area). While the majority of ecosystems have some protection, only 32 ecosystem types (`r perc_wp_count`%), representing `r perc_wp_extent`% of the mainland marine area, are Well Protected. It should be noted that changes in relation to the previous assessment [@sink2019a] do not reflect genuine changes in ecosystem protection level, but are due to revised targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. A table of the ecosystem protection level and threat status results can be downloaded from the [Data section](#data2) below.

South Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the [Phakisa MPA network](https://www.marineprotectedareas.org.za/explore). Of the 83 ecosystem types that were Not Protected before 2019, 67 types received their first protection in 2019 with the proclamation of 20 new or expanded MPAs [@sink2023d]. These included 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types. Additionally, 18 ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected in 2019, going from a total of 9% to `r perc_wp_count`%. Since 2019, no new MPAs have been established. However, protection for African penguin foraging areas has been strengthened through fishing closures around six breeding colonies. In addition, new work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), which may help diversify protection models [@kirkman2025].

Ecosystem types on the KwaZulu-Natal shelf generally have higher protection levels while ecosystem types in the Southern Benguela are the least protected (@fig-epl_map_benthic and @fig-epl_map_pelagic). Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. [Slopes](https://mzansea590234219.wordpress.com/ecosystems/slopes/), [abyssal plains](https://mzansea590234219.wordpress.com/ecosystems/the-abyss/), muddy and [rocky shelves](https://mzansea590234219.wordpress.com/ecosystems/rocky-shelves/) are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (@fig-epl_bargraphs). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. However, while protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves and coastal areas, it should be noted that the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also [less threatened](marine_ets.qmd).

Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement through collaborative efforts that more effectively address existing pressures. Furthermore, new activities that may conflict with MPA objectives should undergo thorough assessment and only proceed if they are clearly demonstrated to be compatible with conservation goals. Strengthened ecosystem management in protected areas can provide an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected.

Ecosystem types that are Not Protected include the Kingklip Koppies, the vast Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope, the expansive Southwest Indian Lower Slope and four pelagic ecosystem types. Among the latter, the Agulhas Retroflection and Southern Ocean Transitional Water is of particular interest as a globally unique area. The uThukela Canyon, the Cape Lower Canyon and St Helena Bay are also Not Protected.

![Submarine canyons cut into the continental slope off South Africa’s western margin. The Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope and the Cape Lower Canyon are both Not Protected ecosystem types. Coastal communities and small-scale fishers can contribute to offshore protection in South Africa and must be included in participatory processes to support new offshore protection measures. (© SANBI)](imgs/canyons_legend.png)

Of the 27 Poorly Protected ecosystem types, several fall into this category because their areas that are within MPAs have high levels of ecosystem modification (i.e. poor [ecological condition](marine_condition.qmd) due to high past or ongoing [pressures](marine_pressures.qmd)), not because they have very limited areas within MPAs. Among others, these include two kelp ecosystem types, Agulhas and Cape Kelp Forests, and two bay ecosystem types, Cape Bay and False and Walker Bay. Other ecosystem types that could advance from their current Poorly Protected status to Moderately Protected by improving ecological condition include Agulhas Mid Shelf Reef, the Agulhas Coarse Sediment Shelf Edge and Amathole Lace Corals.

![An excellent area to improve protection of the Poorly Protected Eastern Agulhas Outer Shelf Mosaic is in the Seaview Horse Mussel Seabed Management Area near Gqeberha. This area has high biodiversity and Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys found clumps of horse mussels that were not observed in areas with greater inshore trawling activity. (© ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink)](imgs/Seaview_Horse_mussels.png)

Forty-eight marine ecosystem types are Moderately Protected. While several of these could advance to Well Protected through improved ecological condition, 27 types will require increased coverage in MPAs or OECMs. For example, Agulhas Boulder Shore, Agulhas Rocky Plateau and Agulhas Upper Canyon require increased representation in South Africa’s marine conservation estate to improve their ecosystem protection level.

![Agulhas Upper Canyon requires increased representation in South Africa’s network of protected and conserved areas to advance to Well Protected. (© Lloyd Edwards and ACEP Deep Secrets and Deep Forests projects)](imgs/Addo_canyons_Lloyd_Edwards_ACEP.png)

Only 20% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types are Well Protected. This statistic could be increased through increasing the estate of representative protected areas and by reducing [pressures](marine_pressures.qmd) and thereby improving [ecological condition](marine_condition.qmd) within some existing MPAs. Well Protected ecosystem types include many from the Delagoa ecoregion where the iSimangaliso MPA and World Heritage Site provides protection to many ecosystem types. Other examples of Well Protected types include Agulhas Inner Shelf Reef, Natal Exposed Rocky Shore and [seamount](https://mzansea590234219.wordpress.com/ecosystems/seamounts-and-ridges/) ecosystem types in the South east Atlantic.

In 2018, South Africa had 25 [coastal MPAs](https://www.marineprotectedareas.org.za/coastal-mpas) covering less than 0.6% (6 260 km^2^) of the ocean around South Africa, up from 0.4% (4 711 km^2^) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly in 2019 and covers 5.4% (51 477 km^2^) of the ocean around South Africa. A map of the 42 MPAs in South Africa is shown in @fig-mpa_map, noting that the [Prince Edward Islands MPA](https://www.marineprotectedareas.org.za/prince-edward-islands-mpa) in South Africa’s [subantarctic territory](../subantarctic/sub-all_sections.qmd) is the biggest of the South African MPAs and lies more than 1 700 km south of Gqeberha. No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019. Learn more about South Africa's MPAs at the [Marine Protected Areas website](https://www.marineprotectedareas.org.za/explore).

### MPA effectiveness

South Africa has made progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of its MPAs [@kirkman2023; @kirkman2021; @mann-lang2021]. These studies reveal gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity, cultural heritage protection and governance, among other attributes, which limit the ecological gains and effectiveness of the MPA network.

Common elements in these evaluations indicate a need to revisit MPA objectives for many MPAs declared before 2019, advance efforts to address historical injustices, strengthen social inclusion and collaboration in the design, implementation and management of protected areas and increase socio-economic research. Innovative transdisciplinary strategies in the co-design of protected and conserved areas and transparent and fair trade-offs in planning are needed [@vanderbank2025a]. This will ensure equitable governance and increased tangible benefits for rights holders, knowledge holders and people affected by protected areas [@kirkman2023]. Closer co-operation with fisheries, heritage and tourism could also deliver more integrated and effective protection [@vanderbank2025a].

::: {#box-1 .callout-note .marine title="Box 1. Tsitsikamma MPA: Ecological gains, historic conflict, and the path toward inclusive governance" collapse="true"}
The Tsitsikamma MPA, established in 1964 and covering 340 km², is South Africa's oldest MPA [@sanparks2020]. Supporting near-pristine rocky shores [@hanekom2011], reef and soft habitats, the area is a breeding ground for chokka squid (*Loligo reynaudii*) [@sauer1995], and protects endemic, slow-growing seabreams ([seabream status page](../species/sp_sparids.qmd)) such as roman (*Chrysoblephus laticeps*), dageraad (*Chyrsoblephus cristiceps*), and red steenbras (*Petrus rupestris*) [@heyns-veale2019], which are heavily fished elsewhere [@buxton1989; @buxton1989a; @cowley2002; @kerwath2007]. Populations inside the MPA are more abundant, larger, and have more mature fish than in surrounding fished areas, with linefish such as galjoen (*Dichistius capensis*), blacktail (*Diplodus capensis*), and bronze bream (*Pachymetopon grande*) thriving inside the MPA [@cowley2002; @brouwer2002; @brouwer2003]. Adult carpenter (*Argyrozona argyrozona*) largely remain resident, while their eggs and larvae spill over to neighbouring areas, supporting fisheries outside the reserve [@brouwer2002; @brouwer2003].

High-relief, deeper reefs further enhance outcomes, hosting distinct species assemblages, higher biomass, and larger fish than shallower and less complex areas, showing that protecting diverse habitats is critical [@heyns-veale2019]. By allowing older, larger fish to persist and reproduce, Tsitsikamma enhances population resilience and spill-over, while also providing long-term research opportunities, tourism benefits, and sustainable fishing benefits.

Although the Tsitsikamma MPA has delivered substantial ecological gains, these successes came with enduring social costs. Established without community consultation, the MPA progressively restricted access from the 1970s and became fully no-take in 2000 [@lombard2020]. Local residents, for whom fishing provided food security, livelihoods, identity, and cultural continuity, experienced these closures as a violation of historical rights and cultural practices [@faasen2007; @muhl2020]. The resulting loss of access generated long-standing frustration, expressed through petitions, protests, and illegal fishing, and contributed to deep mistrust between communities and the conservation authority.

These tensions were intensified by governance processes widely viewed as top-down, with limited stakeholder engagement [@watts2009; @muhl2020]. Multiple attempts to reopen access in the 2000s failed, fuelling further conflict. The 2016 rezoning, which opened 20% of the coastline to registered local fishers (rod and line fishing from the shore), sought to restore access and address past injustices. However, the process was criticised for being rushed, insufficiently inclusive, and misaligned with scientific advice [@lombard2020; @muhl2020]. Scientists, NGOs, and some community members raised concerns about decision-making transparency, the representativity of stakeholder input, and potential ecological consequences.

While relationships have improved since rezoning, access alone cannot resolve the deeper governance challenges that shaped the conflict. The literature highlights that enduring tensions relate to issues of recognition, trust, values, and equitable involvement in decision-making [@watts2009; @muhl2020]. Without governance arrangements that meaningfully include communities, acknowledge historical context, and create shared authority, the MPA risks continued social contestation and missed opportunities for socially just and ecologically effective conservation.

### OECMs

The concept of OECMs offers new opportunities for more inclusive and people-centred approaches to marine conservation that can encourage and support resource co-management, diverse cultural values, livelihoods and enhanced sustainability, while reducing the burden on MPA expansion in South Africa [@kirkman2023]. These areas are governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the *in situ* conservation of biodiversity values, whether or not biodiversity conservation is the primary management objective. No marine areas have been recognised as OECMs in South Africa as of December, 2025.

Exploratory assessments of various management measures that exist in the marine realm allowed for the identification of measures that hold most promise for OECM recognition. These included a marine buffer zone of a biosphere reserve, closed fishing areas adjacent to African penguin colonies, and estuaries with estuarine management plans. Going forward, it may be strategic to prioritise sites under the above measures for formal assessment against OECM criteria.

There are certain measures that South Africa's legislation makes provision for but are yet to be implemented, which could meet the criteria for OECM recognition, depending on where and how they are implemented. An example is Special Management Areas under the [National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act](https://www.gov.za/documents/national-environmental-management-integrated-coastal-management-act). Sites under this measure can be designated primarily for cultural purposes and could potentially constitute OECMs that uphold cultural sustainability, promote the connection of people with their environment and heritage, and facilitate greater inclusivity in marine conservation and management in the country.

![South Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Sites such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation relevance and recognition as OECMs in partnership with value holders.

New research [@dunga2025] has supported progress in identifying and characterising Culturally Significant Areas for inclusion in Marine Spatial Planning and coastal management. Eight categories of Culturally Significant Areas were identified drawing from literature, orature and expert knowledge [@dunga2025]. These cover tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage, including iconic seascapes, traditional fishing grounds, sites of spiritual and ceremonial importance and oral tradition. Spatial management in alignment with OECM criteria could help to safeguard the deep and diverse cultural ties many South Africans have to the coastal and marine environment. The establishment of small scale fishing zones, a provision under the Marine Living Resources Act, could also be explored as a mechanism for OECM recognition, providing protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding marine ecosystems and cultural heritage [@kowalski2025].

Improving marine ecosystem protection requires strategic collaborative expansion of protected and conserved areas, but also actions to improve ecosystem condition and compliance in existing MPAs, including co-management and redress where historical injustices persist.

The history and approach to the development of South Africa’s protection level assessment is provided on the [ecosystem protection level explainer page](../integrated-findings/chl_epl_explained.qmd) and will be published [@harris2025]. The 2025 ecosystem protection level assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets (@fig-epl_schematic). While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% marine target with an additional rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target for all ecosystem types. When calculating the percentage of area within an MPA, the area contributions were scaled by condition to account for the fact that areas of high modification do not contribute to an ecosystem's protection level as much as areas of natural condition. The protection contribution was scaled in alignment with the IUCN RLE criteria C and D thresholds of modification. Further, in order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify for the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.

Changes in ecosystem protection level between 2018 and 2025 are caused by the increased target and improved methodology rather than genuine changes in protection or ecological condition. Note that OECMs will contribute to ecosystem protection level once these have been recognised in the marine realm [@kirkman2025; @kowalski2025].

Recent evaluations of ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness for existing MPAs were synthesised to distil key findings beyond the spatial analysis of ecosystem protection level. Synergies in underlying themes related to effectiveness and in recommendations to improve effectiveness or the evaluation thereof were identified. An analysis of stakeholder comments that was undertaken to inform future MPA expansion efforts was also consulted [@sinkd] and the work undertaken through the iAtlantic project [@sink2023a; @sink2023b], Mission Atlantic project [@sink2023c], the ACEP Deep Connections and One Ocean Hub projects [@vanderbank2025b] including the Aliwal Shoal Working Group [@aliwalshoalmpaworkinggroup2024], and SeaPeople [@vanderbank2025c] were additional key informants. Inputs from an additional workshop that discussed the draft results of the 2025 marine assessment and co-developed recommended priority actions, also provided useful insights [@rylands; @sink2023e; @subramoney2024a].
