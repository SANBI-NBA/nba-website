Knowledge gap causing limitation to the NBA 2018 ,Research priorities,Progress and gaps
Spatial and economic data on the benefits of marine biodiversity to people is currently very limited and often outdated. There is also a need for further work on marine ecological infrastructure (EI) work to map fisheries EI.,"Improved economic data, updated statistics on jobs and spatial data on biodiversity benefits are a priority and will be very valuable for prioritisation and decision- making processes beyond the NBA, and communicating the relevance of biodiversity. ","There has been progress in mapping coastal ecological infrastructure [@perschke2023; @perschke2024] **(Perschke et al. 2023a,b and 2024 )**. South African researchers participated in a study that identified 12 deep-sea ecosystem services in an emerging framework to support application in spatial planning [@labianca2023]. Limited progress in key statistics needed to better communicate the benefits of biodiversity. Other gaps include the fact that for e.g. Mining accounts do not currently include any footprint."
"Gaps in taxonomic knowledge are substantial, particularly for marine invertebrates and invasive alien species. Taxonomic uncertainties are a major constraint to species assessments and the ability to conduct comprehensive Red List assessments.  ","A systematic process of detailed taxonomic studies on priority groups, including field collections and DNA barcoding, is essential for the enhancement of national species datasets. It is also crucial to build and maintain South African taxonomic knowledge and expertise, especially for understudied taxonomic groups.",Taxonomic progress over the last few years includes progress made through the SAEON led SeaMap project which provided new distribution records for marine invertebrates that are informing spatial biodiversity priorities (Priority areas - link to CBA map section). Citizen science is also supporting taxonomic research ([Nudiranchs](#box-1)) although potential records far exceed taxonomic capacity and reference collections need investment to make the most of this approach. A  reference image database [@adams2024] is being advanced and there is a need to invest in digital taxonomy [@rogers2023]. Progress in the application of machine learning in processing of seabed imagery is limited by taxonomic constraints with a need to undertake reference collections with in situ images and barcodes linked to taxonomic samples. Further systematic prioritization of invertebrate groups together with filling taxonomic knowledge gaps could improve our ability to conduct more Red List  assessments for marine invertebrates [@subramoney2024].
