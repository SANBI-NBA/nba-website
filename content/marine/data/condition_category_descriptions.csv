Ecological condition category,Description,Examples that might result in the ecological condition
Natural / near natural,Largely natural with few modifications of biota and habitats and ecosystem functions remain unchanged.,"Areas where few if any pressures are found, such as low levels or infrequent pelagic fishing or shipping. Untrawled seabed."
Moderately modified,"A modification of natural habitat and biota have occurred, but the ecosystem functions persist and remain largely unchanged.","Moderate levels of single lower impact pressures or low levels of a number of these pressures, such as pelagic fishing or longlining, or low levels of higher impact pressures, such as linefishing."
Heavily modified,A large loss of natural habitat and biota and substantial changes or losses have occurred in ecosystem functions.,"Moderate levels of multiple pressures (such as linefishing, pollution) or high levels of pressures that modify marine ecosystems, such as intense demersal trawling (or even light trawling on sensitive habitats) or heavy linefishing effort."
Severely modified,Extensive loss of natural habitat and biota and ecosystem functions are severely impacted or completely lost.,"Very high levels of pressures that severely modify marine ecosystems (such as frequent demersal trawling, mining, coastal development) or multiple high intensity pressures (e.g. flow reduction, trawling, heavy linefishing effort). Also includes built infrastructure, such as ports."
