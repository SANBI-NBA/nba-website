*More than 54% of South Africa's estuaries are relatively healthy, but this amounts to only 18% of total estuarine extent, comprised mostly of small estuaries. Concerning overall, more than 70% of estuarine area is significantly modified.* <!--# Key statistics section: This section can be edited to report more/fewer statistics by adding more items to each column (these will be stacked), or adding more columns (then they will be placed next to each other). Using source view, copy and paste the entire block (the three lines with the pipe | at the start), and edit contents as necessary. Be careful to apply the correct styling parameters (the bits in the sqiggly brackets {}). If you are adding or removing columns, remember to adjust the column widths to add up to 100%. Preferably add more rows, as more than two columns tend to display poorly on narrow screens. Delete the entire section (plus the horizontal line above the Summary header) if you don't want to include statistics on your page-->

## Ecosystem threat status assessment

The estuarine realm is one of the most threatened in South Africa, in terms of both number of ecosystem types and by area.

About 59% of the 22 estuary types are threatened with 23% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered and 18% Vulnerable. Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.

Multiple interventions are required to avoid further decline in health. These include protection of freshwater inflow to estuaries and the sea, restoration of water quality, reduction in fishing effort and avoidance of mining, infrastructure development and crops in the estuarine functional zone.

## Approach

The 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.

The IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:

-   **Criterion A2b** (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.

-   **Criterion A3** (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022

-   **Criterion B3** was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by \>1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

-   **Criterion D1** was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

-   **Criterion D3** was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of \>= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity \>=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity \>=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

Each of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.

A more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at [RLE explanation page](../integrated-findings/chl_rle_explained.qmd).
