<!--# Key statistics section: This section can be edited to report more/fewer statistics by adding more items to each column (these will be stacked), or adding more columns (then they will be placed next to each other). Using source view, copy and paste the entire block (the three lines with the pipe | at the start), and edit contents as necessary. Be careful to apply the correct styling parameters (the bits in the sqiggly brackets {}). If you are adding or removing columns, remember to adjust the column widths to add up to 100%. Preferably add more rows, as more than two columns tend to display poorly on narrow screens. Delete the entire section (plus the horizontal line above the Summary header) if you don't want to include statistics on your page-->

## Approach

The 2025 assessment of South Africaâ€™s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.

The IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:

-   **Criterion A2b** (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.

-   **Criterion A3** (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022

-   **Criterion B3** was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by \>1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

-   **Criterion D1** was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

-   **Criterion D3** was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of \>= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity \>=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity \>=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.

Each of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.

A more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at [RLE explanation page](../integrated-findings/chl_rle_explained.qmd).

<!--# This section is compulsory for all scientific content, but what you include here is flexible based on what you have available for your indicators -->

<!--# the below examples/recommendations can be modified, e.g. you could do a technical report PDF, as long as it is made available on a public repository (figshare?) and can be linked to in this document -->

<!--# avoid linking to Google Drive or other personal drives that may not be permanent. -->

<!--# Always use DOI to link to published papers - never use the journal's website -->
