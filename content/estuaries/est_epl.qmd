<!--# Key statistics section: This section can be edited to report more/fewer statistics by adding more items to each column (these will be stacked), or adding more columns (then they will be placed next to each other). Using source view, copy and paste the entire block (the three lines with the pipe | at the start), and edit contents as necessary. Be careful to apply the correct styling parameters (the bits in the sqiggly brackets {}). If you are adding or removing columns, remember to adjust the column widths to add up to 100%. Preferably add more rows, as more than two columns tend to display poorly on narrow screens. Delete the entire section (plus the horizontal line above the Summary header) if you don't want to include statistics on your page-->

## Approach {#summary}

The protection level assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets. While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target with an addition rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target: In order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural / near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected. Additionally, any area inside an MPA that was in degraded condition had it's contribution to the protection level target scaled according to the severity of the degradation.

In 2018, South Africa had 25 coastal Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) covering less than 0.6% of the ocean around South Africa (6 260 km2), up from 0.4% (4 711 km2) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly between 2018 and 2019 and now covers 5.4% of the ocean around South Africa (51 477 km2). No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019. The total number of MPAs in South Africa increased to 42 (Figure 65).

## Ecosystem protection level Assessment

Of the 70 ecosystem types that were previously Not Protected, 58 received their first protection, including 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types. In 2019, an additional x (used to be 17) ecosystem types have advanced to Well Protected with a total of 20% of ecosystem types now falling within this category. There is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through ecosystem restoration and strengthened MPA management to reduce ecosystem degradation.

# load the data 
epl_combined <- read.csv(file=list.files(path = paste0(here::here(), "/quarto/data"), pattern = "^epl_combined_count_extent.csv$", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE), 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE)

# Combined EPL plot
epl_combined_plot <- nba_plot_comb(epl_combined,
                                   ecosystem_functional_type_getl3,
                                   METRIC_COL = metric,
                                   METRICS = c("count", "extent"),
                                   2:5,
                                   CHRT = "bar",
                                   NUM = FALSE,
                                   LAB = "Percentage of ecosystem",
                                   SAVE = NULL)

```

Additional offshore MPAs will need to be established to represent ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected. Ecosystem types in the Natal-Delagoa ecoregion are the best protected of the shelf ecoregions and ecosystem types in the Southern Benguela are less protected. Protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves, but the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups. Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. Increasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement.

There is progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs, which reveal gaps in connectivity, participation, cultural heritage protection and governance limiting progress in protection. It is increasingly evident that MPAs won't work if they don’t consider and involve people and address issues that undermine their legitimacy and effectiveness. Other Effective Conservation Measures offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection.
