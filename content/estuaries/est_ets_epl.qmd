*In the Estuarine realm, 32% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the Cool Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions.*

![The Mbashe Estuary is representative of the threatened and under protected Large Fluvially Dominated ecosystem type currently classified as endangered. The Mbashe Estuary is one of the few estuaries contributing ecosystem type targets for a type that is in dire need of increased protection and management interventions.](imgs/20231202_091909.png)

## Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types

In the Estuarine realm, 32% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected. These types are prevalent in the Cool Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions. These include the following seven ecosystem types:

-   Cool Temperate Estuarine Lakes (Verlorenvlei, Zeekoei, Bot/Kleinmond, Klein)
-   Cool Temperate Large Fluvially Dominated (Orange)
-   Cool Temperate Predominantly Open (Olifants, Groot Berg, Uilkraals)
-   Cool Temperate Arid Predominantly Closed (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord), Wadrift)
-   Cool Temperate Large Temporarily Closed (Jakkals, Diep/Rietvlei, Sout (Wes), Disa, Wildevoëlvlei, Silwermyn, Zand, Eerste, Palmiet)
-   Subtropical Estuarine Bay (Durban Bay)
-   Subtropical Large Fluvially Dominated (Mbashe, Mzimvubu, uMvoti, uThukela, iMfolozi/uMsunduze)

Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through formal protected areas expansion or other spatial management measures such as stewardship or Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).

In addition to the expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, management of pollution (wastewater, agricultural return flow or stormwater), reduced fishing pressure, restoration of degraded habitats, removal of invasive alien plants, and effective artificial breaching (where required).
