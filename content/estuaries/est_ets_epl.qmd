## Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types

In the Estuarine realm, 31% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the Cool Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions.\*\* These include the following seven ecosystem types:

-   Cool Temperate Arid Predominantly Closed (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord), Wadrift)

-   Cool Temperate Estuarine Lakes (Verlorenvlei, Zeekoei, Bot/Kleinmond, Klein)

-   Cool Temperate Large Fluvially Dominated (Orange)

-   Cool Temperate Predominantly Open (Olifants, Groot Berg, Uilkraals)

-   Subtropical Estuarine Bay (Durban Bay)

### Lara to revisit the types to list the estuaries that can contribute

## JUST LIST NUMBER OF ECOSYSTEMS ON DONUT.

## CAN WE HAVE A TABLE OF THE TYPES NEXT TO MAPS

Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through formal protected areas expansion or other spatial management measures such as stewardship or Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs).

In addition to expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, managment of pollution (wastewater, agricultural return flow or stormwater), reduced fishing pressure, restoration of degraded habitats, removal of invasive alien plants, and effective artificial breaching (where required).
