## Key findings {#summary}

-   South Africa’s flora shows very high levels of species diversity and endemism: 13,642 of the 20,248 taxa (67%), with high concentration in the Fynbos biome.

-   1 in 5 endemic taxa are threatened.

-   Trends in species status over time were assessed using a representative sample of 900 plant taxa, revealing an increase in extinction risks. Plants threatened with extinction increased by 2% between 2017 and 2024.

-   Declining trends are driven mainly by habitat loss and further intensified by invasive species, illegal harvesting, and the intensifying impacts of climate change.

-   Protected area expansion has improved plant protection.

### Threat status, trends and pressures

1.  ***Threat status***

South Africa has assessed the threat status of 20,248 indigenous plant species using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species categories and criteria, which reflect a species’ risk of extinction. The Red List includes several extinct categories, three threatened categories - Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) - as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD), and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range- restricted endemic species with a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km² that occur in areas with no significant anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are prioritized for national conservation interventions, even if they qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system. 

Among assessed taxa, 0.2% (36) are extinct or possibly extinct, and 15% (3,195) are threatened. The country also has high endemism, with 13,648 taxa (67%) found only in South Africa. 

Given this exceptional diversity and high levels of threat, monitoring all species is not practical. To track trends in extinction risk and identify the pressures driving these risks, a representative sample of 900 plant taxa was used. Of the assessed sample taxa, 17% taxa are threatened with extinction (Figure 3 C).

## Box 1. Conservation interventions for medicinal plants reversing extinction risk trends (*Warbrugia salutaris*).

A pioneering conservation model developed in the Kruger National Park and spread to other parts of South Africa, has successfully resulted in the highly popular medicinal plant the pepper bark tree being downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable. The conservation intervention that supplies traditional healers with cultivated plants to grow in home gardens, has reduced pressure on wild populations while ensuring continued access to culturally important resources. The intervention has slowed and reversed the species’ decline, leading to a genuine improvement in its Red List status. Building on this success, the model is now being expanded to other medicinal plant species, offering a replicable blueprint for balancing cultural practices with biodiversity conservation.

2.  **Trends – Red List Index**

The trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs) [@butchart2004]. The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern, and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of plants is calculated using a sample of 900 plant taxa.

The Red List Index results indicate a gradual decline in the conservation status of plant species. About 5% of the sample taxa became more threatened between 1990 and 2018, with a further 2% increasing in threat between 2018 and 2024.

An increase in extinction risk is evident for plant taxa occurring in the Desert and Succulent Karoo biomes (@fig-3). Rising threat levels for plants have largely been driven by climate change and habitat loss caused by mining and renewable energy developments. Most of the plants that have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape. The province has been severely affected by drought over the past decade and continues to face pressure from mining and renewable energy developments.

3.  ***Pressures***

Species in terrestrial ecosystems are subject to multiple and interacting pressures, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive alien species, pollution, resource use, and climate change. Among these, habitat loss remains the most significant pressure and the single largest cause of species decline. The main drivers of habitat loss include the conversion of natural vegetation for croplands, mining, plantations, human settlements, and infrastructure development. Habitat fragmentation further affects ecological functioning and the viability of species, especially under climate change and biological invasions.

Recent analyses reveal a notable shift in the primary drivers of extinction risk for plant taxa. Historically, these risks were predominantly associated with competition from invasive species, agricultural expansion, urban development, and overgrazing by livestock. However, current trends indicate an increasing influence of climate change and habitat degradation linked to mining activities, alongside emerging threats from renewable energy infrastructure development. This shift is particularly evident in the Northern Cape Province, where a significant number of species have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk. The province has experienced prolonged drought over the past decade and continues to face expanding mining activities. In addition to climate change, emerging threats such as renewable energy development could further impact already stressed ecosystems.

Agriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock farming, continues to affect the largest proportion of taxa (68%), while residential and commercial developments, though largely historical, still impact 36%, with a small but ongoing decline. Among the species that changed in threat status, the main contributing pressures were competition from invasive alien species (57%), harvesting of plants (28%), and habitat loss due to mining (13%). The influence of climate change and severe weather events is also becoming more pronounced, now affecting 11% of taxa.

## Box 2. Illegal trade in succulent plants.

South Africa's unique succulent diversity, particularly in the globally significant Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot, faces catastrophic pressure from a dramatic surge in illegal harvesting driven by lucrative international demand. Since 2017, 878 species, the majority endemic, have been impacted by indiscriminate wild collection. A total of 878 species have been illegally collected, with 12 species considered functionally extinct due to the majority of their populations being harvested from the wild.

The succulent trade crisis stems from multiple interconnected factors: a notable absence of cultivated material to meet global horticultural demand, limited economic opportunities in remote regions like the Northern Cape that make residents vulnerable to recruitment by criminal syndicates, inadequate in-situ protection measures across vast arid landscapes, and the proliferation of online trade platforms that facilitate laundering operations. These pressures have been exacerbated by climate change impacts, including extended drought conditions since 2016, the COVID-19 pandemic's socio-economic effects, and overwhelmed conservation authorities struggling with insufficient resources and capacity to manage the growing volume of confiscated plants requiring specialized care.

Recognizing that initial law enforcement-focused responses had limited impact, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and the Environment, in partnership with the South African National Biodiversity Institute and WWF South Africa, developed the comprehensive National Response Strategy and Action Plan in 2022 to address the illegal trade holistically through collaborative multi-stakeholder action. The strategy encompasses seven interconnected objectives designed to ensure both conservation outcomes and sustainable socio-economic development: ensuring long-term survival of representative wild populations, establishing well-managed ex-situ collections for confiscated specimens, capacitating compliance and enforcement sectors with improved resources and coordination, streamlining regulatory frameworks to support enforcement while enabling sustainable use, reducing pressure on wild populations through community engagement and livelihood diversification, developing effective communication strategies about the trade's impacts, and exploring options for a formal legal economy that benefits conservation and local development. Each objective identifies specific actions, lead agencies, supporting partners, priorities, and timelines, with SANBI coordinating overall implementation through dedicated coordination positions established in 2023.

Plants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 taxa. Peripheral taxa with less than 5% of their distribution in South Africa were excluded from the analysis. Protection levels were calculated for this sample to track changes in extinction risk over time (see the technical approach [here](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Technical_Report/30135625?file=58824784)).

The analysis indicates an overall increase in the number of Well Protected species, while species in the Poorly Protected and Moderately Protected categories showed only minor changes. Of the 900 species assessed, 72 (8%) shifted protection level categories between 2017 and 2024. Most of these changes (60) were positive, driven primarily by improved management and the establishment of new protected areas. However, deterioration in management effectiveness at eight protected areas led to a decrease in the Protection Level for 12 species. Plant species are severely affected by threats occurring within protected area boundaries, leading to a downgrade in their protection category. The main reason for the ineffectiveness of these protected areas is the high level of plant poaching in the protected area of Namaqualand.

Many species have shown an improvement in their protection levels since the last assessment in 2018. A total of 5% of the assessed plant species now have better protection, largely due to the proclamation of the Mountain Zebra–Camdeboo Protected Environment, Gamsberg Nature Reserve, and Orange River Mouth Nature Reserve.

## Species recovery

As part of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4, signatories are committed to taking urgent action to halt human-induced extinctions, reduce species’ risk of extinction, and improve their conservation status by 2030. Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts to prevent and reverse species declines, recover and conserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity, particularly among threatened species. South Africa has initiated a process with each taxonomic group that has comprehensive Red List assessments for their taxonomic groups, to identify and prioritise species in urgent need of recovery to contribute to achieving the GBF Target 4 goals.

## Box 4. A prioritization process for plant recovery.

With over 3000 plants threatened with extinction, multiple interventions to address threatened species declines are required, including the expansion of protected areas, the restoration of habitats that are being degraded by invasive species, and the inclusion of threatened plants in biodiversity sector plans. In addition, 293 critically endangered and endangered plants need active recovery projects to take place in order to ensure that they do not go extinct in the next decade. Between 2020 and 2023, the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) led a process to prioritise plants in urgent need of recovery, using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria to select those in most urgent need of recovery. A species recovery working group with conservation agencies and indigenous plant growers has been established, and each stakeholder has been allocated a handful of species to implement recovery work on. A major upscaling of resources to support species recovery is required, as only 14 of the 293 species that require recovery have active recovery projects implemented.

Below are two examples of critically endangered plant species that require urgent recovery interventions to ensure their long-term survival. The accompanying flyers outline the key activities needed, including habitat restoration, population reinforcement, and threat mitigation. If you would like to financially support the recovery of a critically endangered plant taxa from extinction, , please contact Ismail Ebrahim at i.Ebrahim\@sanbi.org.za
