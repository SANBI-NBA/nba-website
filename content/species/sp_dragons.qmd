![[Yellow presba](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/63202/12628404) (*Syncordulia gracilis*). This species is rare throughout its range and has not been recorded for many years at several historically occupied sites (e.g. Michell’s Pass). Although it has recovered at some localities following the removal of invasive alien trees (e.g. Franschhoek Pass), it remains Vulnerable. It is currently known from only a few sites, at approximately six locations. (© Michael Samways)](./imgs/Syncordulia_gracilis_1.png){fig-align="center"}
