### Threat status, trends and pressures

1.  ***Threat status***

The number of South African marine species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria is 497 (check) through a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Of these, approximately 36% (update) (was 18% in 2018) of taxa are threatened. However, this is not representative of the actual proportion of taxa threatened as there has been a focus on assessing economically important species and species at risk with few comprehensively assessed marine taxonomic groups leading to an inflation of threatened taxa. Species assessments in the marine realm are limited by capacity shortfalls, gaps in taxonomic knowledge, and the lack of information on species distribution, life histories and long-term population trends has resulted in high levels of data deficiency. Marine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency across all realms signalling the need to address knowledge gaps and increase capacity for marine species red listing.

Assessments for sharks, rays and chimaeras were conducted for the first time with cartilaginous fishes emerging as the most threatened group with 41% being threatened (link to bird page).

Many of the shark and ray species are wide ranging and much of their declines can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other regions, however 42% of South Africa's endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened, indicating that the country has an important role in reversing declines of these charismatic predators. Many cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, have slow growth and low reproductive output, and many are declining across their ranges due to overfishing including from recreational fisheries and as bycatch from industrial fisheries, lethal bather protection measures and habitat degradation.

A re-assessment of South Africa’s seabreams show 10 (24%) of the 42 assessed **seabreams** are threatened with 2 Critically Endangered, 4 Endangered and 4 Vulnerable species. Of South Africa’s 6 marine **reptiles**, four of six species are threatened with turtles at risk from fisheries bycatch or incidental mortalities. Seabirds…..(Alistair and Newi). Eight of 51 **marine mammals** are threatened (16%) with the Indian ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea being of local concern. The primary threat is the lethal shark control measures with pollution, coastal development and shipping also contributing to pressure on this species.

::: {#box-1 .callout-note .species title="Box 1. Conservation status of the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin (Sousa plumbea)" collapse="true"}
The impacts of fishing (as incidental bycatch) of Endangered Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin (Sousa plumbea) are exacerbated by shipping, pollution and coastal development due to its shallow water habit (Plön et al. 2016). Developments in estuaries and the alteration or loss of rocky shores, both critical habitat for the Indian Ocean Humpback dolphin, affect this species both directly and indirectly (Barros and Cockcroft 1999, Jefferson et al. 2009, Plön et al. 2011). Recent research has shown that the population size of this species is possibly much smaller (500 individuals) than the 1000 individual population size used during its 2016 IUCN Red List Assessment (Vermeulen et al. 2017). The development of a National Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) aimed at ensuring the long‐term survival of the species in South Africa is strongly recommended. National and international collaboration will need to be strengthened to ensure a thorough assessment of the species' conservation status within and beyond the border of South Africa (Vermeulen et al. 2017).
:::

Due to poor taxonomic knowledge and a paucity of occurrence records, most marine **invertebrates** cannot be assessed – however, a small sample of utilised marine invertebrates (10 spiny lobster and abalone) found that 3 of 11 species are threatened . Among the 20 coastal invertebrates that have been assessed are x sandy beach macrofauna which are the first beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species globally. Of these, 4 (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further 3 (15%) are Near Threatened. The pressures on coastal invertebrates are mainly mining on the West Coast, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp from the shore.

<summary>*Haliotis midae*</summary>

<img src="imgs/sp_mar_1.png" alt="box_2_img_1" style="width:45%; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/>***Haliotis midae*****, commonly known as Perlemoen**, has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2021 due to the collapse of what was once a thriving commercial fishery that peaked at 2,800 tons in 1965 but has been severely reduced. Current legal quotas of only 96 tons is now allowed annually. The legal commercial fishery, managed through Total Allowable Catch allocations across seven zones in the Western Cape, has been systematically undermined and overwhelmed by industrial-scale illegal fishing operations. Organized criminal gangs, linked to international drug trafficking, have exploited this species at catastrophic levels, with illegal harvests estimated at over 2,000 tons annually compared to the tiny legal quotas. Population surveys reveal widespread recruitment failure throughout all commercial zones, as illegal fishing targets predominantly immature individuals below the legal minimum size, preventing reproduction and causing population densities to fall below levels necessary for successful breeding. The assessment projects continued steep decline in spawning biomass through 2035, with recovery possible only through a 59% reduction in poaching combined with robust enforcement measures.

<summary>*Jasus lalandii*</summary>

<img src="imgs/sp_mar_2.png" alt="box_2_img_2" style="width:45%; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/> ***Jasus lalandii*****, the West Coast Rock Lobster**, has become more threatened and uplisted from Least Concerned to Endangered in 2025, primarily due to severe population decline, with exploitable biomass falling by 68% over the past three generations (45 years) and current stock levels at only 1.2% of pre-fished levels from 1910. The species faces overwhelming pressure from illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is estimated to remove more than twice as much biomass annually as legal fishing operations. Total Allowable Catch quotas have been reduced by 91% from over 5,000 tonnes in the late 1970s to just 505 tonnes in 2024/2025, reflecting the resource's dire condition. Environmental stresses have compounded fishing pressures, including significant reductions in somatic growth rates since the 1990s, mass strandings caused by low oxygen events (with an estimated 2,000 tonnes lost in the 1997 "walkout" alone), and an eastward distribution shift that has disrupted traditional fishing areas. Climate change effects, including increased frequency of algal blooms and hypoxic conditions, continue to threaten the species through habitat degradation and physiological stress. The species' biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is slow-growing with a 15-year generation length and complex life cycle including an extended larval stage. Despite decades of management measures including minimum size limits, seasonal restrictions, and operational management procedures, the combination of heavy fishing pressure and environmental changes has pushed this economically important species to the brink of collapse

<summary>*Palinurus gilchristi*</summary>

<img src="imgs/sp_mar_3.png" alt="box_2_img_3" style="width:45%; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/> ***Palinurus gilchristi*****, the South Coast Rock Lobster**, has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2025 primarily due to historical overexploitation that caused significant population declines over the past three generations (48 years). The species' exploitable biomass has declined by 35% since the 1977/1978 fishing season, with current stock assessments indicating spawning biomass is at only 41% of pre-fished levels. A major contributing factor was illegal overharvesting by one company between 1987-2001, which significantly exceeded fishing quotas and caused concurrent drops in both biomass and catch rates across all three fishing areas. The species' biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is long-lived (up to 30 years), slow-growing, and doesn't reach sexual maturity until around 10 years of age. While improved management measures including reduced quotas, effort controls, and vessel number restrictions have led to some recovery in recent years, the cumulative decline over three generations still qualifies the species for Vulnerable status under IUCN criteria

<summary>*Donax serra*</summary>

<img src="imgs/sp_mar_4.png" alt="box_2_img_4" style="width:45%; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/> ***Donax serra*****, the White Mussel**, is listed as Endangered primarily due to severe population declines of 50-80% over the past decade, as evidenced by commercial fishery data showing catch per unit effort more than halving and approximately 80% reduction in total catch in South Africa. The species faces multiple compounding threats, with commercial and recreational harvesting being the primary driver, particularly after management changes in 2007 that switched from total allowable catch limits to effort-based regulations, leading to reported harvests increasing from around 50,000 individuals annually in the 1990s-2000s to over 1-1.45 million per year after 2007/2008. Mining activities, which affect about 20-25% of the species' range, cause significant habitat degradation by changing beach sand grain size through tailings deposits, making the sediment too coarse for the clams to burrow effectively and essentially eliminating them from affected sites. Resurveyed beaches show dramatic declines, with abundance at four sites near Plettenberg Bay dropping to only 24-48% of 1980s levels, and anecdotal reports from both Namibia and South Africa describe former abundance hotspots where the species is now extremely difficult to find. The species is particularly vulnerable because it is restricted to specific fine-sand beach habitats and has limited dispersal ability despite having pelagic larvae, making recovery from local population crashes difficult when combined with the ongoing multiple stressors across its range.

2.  ***Trends (RLI)***

The trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs). The RLIs is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct.

Add further details discussing the findings in detail, improvements, deteriorations, a table can be added of taxa that have had genuine increase/decrease in status.

3.  ***Pressures***

In the marine realm, increased risk to species is attributed to multiple pressures with overfishing and lethal shark control measures, estuarine degradation, flow reduction, coastal mining, pollution (and climate change) contributing to worsening species threat status.

```

A meta-analysis of the key pressures impacting on taxa of conservation concern revealed that fishing remains the greatest pressure on marine species. Key additional pressures include pollution (plastics, underwater noise, waste water and effluent) and freshwater flow reduction, while key threats include climate change and marine alien and invasive species.
