![[*Bradypodion thamnobates*](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/3017/197397461) is restricted to the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. It occurs in the remaining fragments of the Southern Mistbelt Forests and appears to tolerate well-vegetated gardens, road verges, and small patches of thick, structured vegetation, even if it is dominated by exotic plants. Juveniles often perch on grasses and/or in more marginal habitats. The species is assessed as Endangered. (© M. Burger)](./imgs/sp_reptiles_img_1.png){fig-align="center"}
