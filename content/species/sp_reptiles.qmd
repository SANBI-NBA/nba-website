![*Bradypodion thamnobates*, this species is distributed in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. It occurs in remaining fragments of Southern Mistbelt Forest and appears to tolerate well-vegetated gardens and road verges, and small patches of thick, structured vegetation, even if this comprises exotic plants. Juveniles often perch on grasses and/or in more marginal habitats [@tolley2007]. The species is assessed as Endangered. © M. Burger.](./imgs/sp_reptiles_img_1.png){fig-align="center"}
