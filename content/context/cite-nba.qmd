Within an NBA cycle (i.e., between releases of a summary publication, usually before a report to the Convention on Biological Diversity is due), the various datasets or results will be versioned at different time points. For example, the NBA 2025 summary publication may use a 2023 marine ecosystem map, 2024 terrestrial threat status and the spider Red List assessment from 2019. The online form of the NBA will allow updates of certain indicators more regularly, making the NBA a ‘living’ assessment that reflects the most current data available. It is therefore extremely important to use the recommended citation as stated on each webpage.
