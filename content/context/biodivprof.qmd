## Summary {#summary}

South Africa has exceptional biodiversity that is globally recognised, characterised by high species richness, high rates of endemism and a wide variety of ecosystem types. Although among the smaller of the worldâ€™s 17 megadiverse countries, which together contain more than two-thirds of the worldâ€™s biodiversity, South Africa ranks in the global top ten of countries in terms of plant species richness and third for marine species endemism. The country holds three of the worldâ€™s 36 recognised biodiversity hotspots, 31 Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance, including the subantarctic Prince Edward Islands) and the Agulhas Bank that is an equivalently unique marine ecosystem (@fig-profile-map). Applying the international standard, South Africa has identified 263 terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), which are sites of global biodiversity significance. This network of KBAs is expected to expand over time as the marine realm is assessed.

## Ecosystem facts

South Africa has a wide range of bioclimatic, oceanographic, geological and topographical settings. Together, these support high ecosystem diversity and endemism. Almost 1 000 distinct ecosystem types have been described and for the purposes of the NBA these are grouped into four realms: terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine. The cross-realm coastal zone is made up of selected terrestrial and marine ecosystems and all estuaries, and the Subantarctic is made up of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Prince Edward Islands, 1 700 km south of mainland South Africa.

**Terrestrial realm**: Nine biomes and 463 ecosystem types, approximately 80% of which are endemic.

**Freshwater realm**: Highly variable rainfall supports diverse freshwater ecosystems; **wetlands** are classified into 82 distinct types, and **rivers** are classified into 222 distinct types.

**Marine realm**: Exceptional marine biodiversity, represented by 163 distinct ecosystem types.

**Estuarine realm**: South Africaâ€™s 290 estuaries and 42 micro-estuaries are classified into 22 estuarine ecosystem types and three micro-estuary types.

**Cross-realm coastal zone**: An ecological definition of the coast is used for biodiversity assessments. It comprises 190 ecosystem types from the terrestrial (83 types), estuarine (22 types) and marine (85 types) ecosystem maps to form a cross-realm coastal zone.

South Africaâ€™s **subantarctic territory** consists of Prince Edward Island, Marion Island and surrounding maritime domain. There are five terrestrial and 29 marine ecosystem types.

South Africa is rich in species (@fig-rich) and is home to an estimated 67 000 animal species, although many invertebrates remain undescribed or undiscovered. The 2025 South African National Plant Checklist records 23 514 taxa and 21 539 species, of which 20 204 are indigenous. Remarkably, 60.5% of these indigenous species are endemic to the country.

Current estimates indicate that South Africa harbours approximately 8% of the worldâ€™s non-vascular and 6% vascular plant species; and 10% of the worldâ€™s dung beetle, 7% of bird, 6% of bee, 5% of mammal, 3% of reptile, 2% of amphibian and 1% of freshwater fish species. In the marine realm, South Africa supports 15% of the worldâ€™s shark, ray and chimaera species, 15% of nudibranch, 13% of marine (bony) fish, and 5% of seaweed (including brown, green and red algae. Several terrestrial invertebrate groups have high richness relative to global statistics, with South Africa hosting nearly 5% of the worldâ€™s butterfly, 4% of spider, and 3% of dragonfly and damselfly species.\
Two-thirds of South Africaâ€™s plant species are endemic, and its cycads represent 10% of the global species count with 92% endemism. Around half of the South African species of amphibians, butterflies, bees, spiders and freshwater fishes are endemic, as are nearly 40% of dung beetle and reptile species. Approximately 30% of seaweed species and 40% of South Africaâ€™s estimated 10 000 marine animal species are endemic, the vast majority being invertebrates.

Microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, fungi, viruses), an often-overlooked and largely unassessed group, are essential for healthy functioning of natural and agricultural systems in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given the countryâ€™s immense diversity of floral and faunal species, and that each species has its own array of microbial species associated with it, it is likely that these are also diverse. For example, it has been estimated that each unique vascular plant species in South Africa is associated with at least seven unique fungal species, implying more than 171 000 fungi species (an underestimate, as fungi associated with invertebrates are not included).
