The NBA is produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) as part of its mandate to report regularly to the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on the status of the country’s biodiversity. SANBI operates through the Network of Partners Model, recognising that such a technically demanding and wide-ranging scientific assessment cannot be achieved without substantial support from numerous partners. This model not only ensures the completion of the NBA, but also fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa. The co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.

NBA 2025 would not have been possible without the substantial in-kind contributions of time, data and expertise from numerous individuals and institutions. From November 2019 to October 2025 more than 490 individuals from approximately 110 institutions contributed over 23 000 person-days of work. Their dedication and expertise are sincerely appreciated – the NBA truly is a multi-stakeholder endeavour.

SANBI is particularly grateful for the strategic and long-term partnerships that supported leadership of the Estuarine (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and Coastal (the Institute for Coastal and Marine Research at Nelson Mandela University) Components of the NBA. Their clear and experienced leadership of these complex components was invaluable.

Various governance structures guide the NBA, ensuring a broad range of experts and stakeholders contributed to the assessment. We extend our thanks to the members of the various ecosystem committees and species working groups for their technical inputs; the NBA 2025 Core Reference Group for leading the complex content; the internal SANBI Cross Functional Steering Committee for oversight and support; and the Strategic Advisory Committee (consisting of senior officials from various government departments and entities, non-governmental organisations and private sector associations) for cross-sectoral inputs and advice on communicating NBA 2025 findings. Appreciation also goes to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment intergovernmental structures where the NBA key messages were tabled for inputs.

Finally, thanks to all the talented photographers who generously donated their images for use in NBA 2025, both in this publication and on the website. Their contributions greatly enrich the presentation and communication of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity.
