	abstract = {As proxies and indicators of environmental conditions, offshore benthic assemblages are pertinent to understanding global change. To investigate long-term change in epibenthic assemblages, we compared digitally reprocessed historical (1988) and repeat (2013) benthic survey photographs from nearshore (40–130 m) and inter-island locations (140–500 m) at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands. Given changing interactions between regional oceanography and terrestrially influenced productivity at the islands, temporal change in the benthos is likely, and is expected to be dependent on proximity to the islands (nearshore vs. inter-island). Multivariate PERMANOVA analyses identified a significant interaction effect on epibenthic assemblages (Year × Location), with significant dispersion effects defining temporal differences within the inter-island region but not in the nearshore area. Differences in epibenthic assemblages observed between 1988 and 2013 were found to be driven primarily by increased abundances of several common suspension feeding taxa, including a significant increase in the density of a key bioengineering species, the polychaete Lanice marionensis. These higher abundances are congruent with local trophic evidence of long-term, climate-related shifts towards greater allochthonous food supply to the benthos. Given this congruence, a unifying explanation for the observed temporal differences in epibenthic assemblages is that long-term alteration of the position of the sub-Antarctic Front has changed the local primary productivity regime and hence the flux of food to the benthos. This study provides the first direct support for the notion of long-term change in epibenthic assemblage composition at the islands. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Estimates of the population at the island fell from about 405 000 pairs in 1983/84 and 434 000 pairs in 1994/95 to about 356 000 pairs in 2002/03. Two large colonies, at Bullard Beach and Kildalkey Bay, account for about 85\% of the overall population. At both these colonies, the area occupied by breeders showed no trend between 1983/84 and 2002/03, but the mean density of nests decreased. However, error on estimates of abundance at these colonies precludes demonstration of a significant decrease in the overall population. Numbers of occupied nests at other colonies decreased from 79 000 in 1994/95 to 31 000 in 2002/03. At three small colonies there was a significant decrease of 88\% between 1982/83 and 2002/03. At Marion Island, macaroni penguins usually breed for the first time when aged about three years. From 1994/95 to 2002/03, pairs fledged an average of 0.46 chicks per year, a number considered insufficient to maintain the population. However, during that period there was a significant increase in reproductive success with time. In the same period, the masses of males and females on arrival at breeding colonies were significantly correlated. Both showed a marked decrease in 1998/99, after the El Niño of 1997/98. In most seasons from 1994/95 to 2001/02 crustaceans dominated the food, but the mass of chicks at fledging was significantly related to the contribution of fish to the diet.},

En general, la especie más afectada fue el petrel de mentón blanco (Procellaria aequinoctalis), siendo los machos capturados con más frecuencia que las hembras.

Un análisis de múltiples variables sugiere que una combinación de factores (ambietales y relacionados con las técnicas de pesca) ha influido en la captura incidental de aves marinas observada. Los resultados de este estudio demuestran que una gran parte de la mortalidad de petreles de mentón blanco y grises depende de la época del año, la zona geográfica y el tipo de palangrero utilizado (cebado manual o automático). Casi toda la mortalidad incidental ocurrió exclusivamente durante la temporada de reproducción, excepto en el caso de lso petreles gigantes. La mortalidad más alta de petreles de mentón blanco, petreles grises, albatros de ceja negra y albatros de cabez gris ocurrió en la época de cría de polluelos.

The 19-year programme comprised seven phases, commencing with a description of the effect of the cats on the Marion Island ecosystem, the characteristics of the cat population and the formulation of a management policy (phase 1: 1974-1976). Methods for control were selected and preparations were made for the implementation of the primary control measure , biological control with the feline panleucopaenia virus (phase 2: 1976/77). The virus was released in 1977 (phase 3: 1977), followed by the determination of its effects (phase 4: 1977-1980). Monitoring of the effects of the virus continued, and the secondary control measure of hunting at night was tested (phase 5: 1981-1983). Full-scale implementation of hunting and continued monitoring of the effects of both the disease and hunting followed (phase 6: 1986-1989). The inclusion of intensive trapping and poisoning as tertiary control measures culminated in the final eradication of cats from Marion Island in 1991 (phase 7: 1989-1993).},

	url = {www.elsevier.com/locate/biocon},
	abstract = {Impacts on the native avifauna of sub-Antarctic islands by introduced vertebrates are well documented for species such as burrowing petrels (Procellariidae), but less is known about impacts on surface-nesting species. The sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, comprising Marion and Prince Edward Islands, support an endemic form of lesser sheathbill (Chionis minor). Marked dierences have developed over the last 20 years in winter habitat use and population trends of sheathbills between the two islands. Currently birds at Marion forage almost exclusively along the coastline and in penguin colonies during winter, but at Prince Edward they occur at higher densities and forage throughout the coastal plain. Compared to the 1970s, sheathbills at Marion are now less abundant around most of the island, forage proportionally less in the vegetation of the coastal plain, commence breeding with a lower body mass and lay smaller clutches. These changes are likely a result of a decrease in terrestrial macro-invertebrate prey, formerly an important winter food resource for sheathbills at Marion Island. The main biological dierence between the two islands is the presence of many more introduced species at Marion, including house mice (Mus musculus) and feral cats (Felis catus) (now eradicated). We suggest that house mice are impacting the sheathbill population by consuming terrestrial macro-invertebrates, and that this impact has been exacerbated by the removal of feral cats, by the massive reduction in burrowing petrels (which promote invertebrate populations through manuring), and by climatic warming (which may be promoting higher densities of mice). This proposed web of interactions between sheathbills, introduced species, invertebrates and burrowing petrels needs to be further investigated, given the likelihood of further climatic change. \#},

	abstract = {Sub-Antarctic islands represent critical breeding habitats for land-based top predators that dominate Southern Ocean food webs. Reproduction and molting incur high energetic demands that are sustained at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) by both inshore (phytoplankton blooms; "island mass effect"; autochthonous) and offshore (allochthonous) productivity. As the relative contributions of these sustenance pathways are, in turn, affected by oceanographic conditions around the PEIs, we address the consequences of climatically driven changes in the physical environment on this island ecosystem. We show that there has been a measurable long-term shift in the carbon isotope signatures of the benthos inhabiting the shallow shelf region of the PEIs, most likely reflecting a long-term decline in enhanced phytoplankton productivity at the islands in response to a climate-driven shift in the position of the sub-Antarctic Front. Our results indicate that regional climate change has affected the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous productivity at the PEIs. Over the last three decades, inshore-feeding top predators at the islands have shown a marked decrease in their population sizes. Conversely, population sizes of offshore-feeding predators that forage over great distances from the islands have remained stable or increased, with one exception. Population decline of predators that rely heavily on organisms inhabiting the inshore region strongly suggest changes in prey availability, which are likely driven by factors such as fisheries impacts on some prey populations and shifts in competitive interactions among predators. In addition to these local factors, our analysis indicates that changes in prey availability may also result indirectly through regional climate change effects on the islands' marine ecosystem. Most importantly, our results indicate that a fundamental shift in the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous trophic pathways within this island ecosystem may be detected throughout the food web, demonstrating that the most powerful effects of climate change on marine systems may be indirect.},

As one of a suite of mitigation measures, we tested the efficacy of a Mustad underwater setting funnel to reduce incidental mortality of seabirds. The funnel, which deploys the longline 1-2 m beneath the sea surface, was used on 52\% of 1714 sets (total effort 5.12 million hooks) over a 2-year period. Used in conjunction with a bird-scaring line, overall seabird bycatch rate was low (0.022 birds per 1000 hooks), and was dominated by white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) (88\% of the 114 birds killed). Bycatch rate was three times lower when the funnel was used both by day and at night. Daytime catch rates with the funnel were less than those attained during night sets without the funnel. In conjunction with other mitigation measures, underwater setting offers a significant reduction in seabird mortality in this fishery and could increase fishing efficiency by allowing daytime setting. However, small numbers of albatrosses were caught during daytime sets with the funnel, and its use for daytime sets should be closely monitored. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study employs systematic conservation planning methods to delineate a MPA within the EEZ that will conserve biodiversity patterns and processes within sensible management boundaries, while minimizing conflict with the legal toothfish fishery. After collating all available distributional data on species, benthic habitats and ecosystem processes, we used C-Plan software to delineate a MPA with three management zones: four IUCN Category Ia reserves (13\% of EEZ); two Conservation Zones (21\% of EEZ); and three Category IV reserves (remainder of EEZ). Compromises between conservation target achievement and the area required by the MPA are apparent in the final reserve design.

	abstract = {© 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. King penguins make up the bulk of avian biomass on a number of sub-Antarctic islands where they have a large functional effect on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The same applies at Marion Island where a substantial proportion of the world population breeds. In spite of their obvious ecological importance, the at-sea distribution and behavior of this population has until recently remained entirely unknown. In addressing this information deficiency, we deployed satellite-linked tracking instruments on 15 adult king penguins over 2 years, April 2008 and 2013, to study their post-guard foraging distribution and habitat preferences. Uniquely among adult king penguins, individuals by and large headed out against the prevailing Antarctic Circumpolar Current, foraging to the west and southwest of the island. On average, individuals ventured a maximum distance of 1,600 km from the colony, with three individuals foraging close to, or beyond, 3,500 km west of the colony. Birds were mostly foraging south of the Antarctic Polar Front and north of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Habitat preferences were assessed using boosted regression tree models which indicated sea surface temperate, depth, and chorophyll a concentration to be the most important predictors of habitat selection. Interestingly, king penguins rapidly transited the eddy-rich area to the west of Marion Island, associated with the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, which has been shown to be important for foraging in other marine top predators. In accordance with this, the king penguins generally avoided areas with high eddy kinetic energy. The results from this first study into the behavioral ecology and at-sea distribution of king penguins at Marion Island contribute to our broader understanding of this species.},

Breeding success for winter breeders (grey petrels Procellaria cinerea (34±21\%) and great-winged petrels Pterodroma macroptera (52±7\%)) were lower than for summer breeders (blue petrels Halobaena caerulea (61±6\%) and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis (59±6\%)) and among winter breeders most chick fatalities were of small chicks up to 14 days old. We assessed the extent of mouse predation by monitoring the inside of 55 burrow chambers with video surveillance cameras (4024 film days from 2012–16) and recorded fatal attacks on grey (3/18 nests filmed, 17\%) and great-winged petrel chicks (1/19, 5\%). Our results show that burrow-nesting petrels are at risk from mouse predation, providing further motivation for the eradication of mice from Marion Island.},

	abstract = {Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides Smitt 1898, is an important commercially targeted Notothenioid species in South-Atlantic waters. In this study we aimed to clarify several aspects ofreproductive biology of Patagonian toothfish in the Falkland Islands waters. Histological examination of female gonads indi- cates that with the beginning of maturation females maintain at least two populations of oocytes, suggesting that toothfish requires up to two years for oocytes devel- opment. Females become mature at an average size of 79.1 cm indicating a decrease of first maturity size if toothfish females in the Falkland Island waters. The majority of females spawn at the size from 101 to 130 cm total length. Distribution of reproductive phases shows an increase of females at developing stage in December and March prior to the spawning peaks in May and August respectively. However, the majority of the toothfish population consist of non-spawning indi- viduals remaining in regressing phase (55.8 to 85.6\%) including the spawning period. The skip-spawning for toothfish has been defined as reabsorbing non- reproductive and resting types. The abbreviation of oo- cytes development in the gonads was observed from 1 to22.1\% of females which omitted the spawning season. Most likely females which remain in the spawning area have the opportunity to spawn more often, whereas fe- males which undergo foraging migration toward North- ern parts of the Falklands waters return to the spawning ground less often. Females remain Northern area longer to accumulate necessary amount of energy. This hypnotise is supported by the presence of females in immature, developing and regressing phase throughout surrounding Falkland Islands waters. Presence of post- spawning females in regressing stage throughout the Falklands waters suggest that toothfish may undertake irregular spawning/foraging migration when favourable for spawning condition occur.},

During 1994/95 – 2002/03 pairs fledged on average 0.40 chicks per year, an amount thought insufficient to balance mortality of breeding adults, and there was a decrease in the mass at arrival at breeding colonies of both males and females. Except in 1997/98, the mass of chicks at fledging was less than that recorded at two other localities. These factors suggest an inadequate supply of food for rockhopper penguins at Marion Island. Decreases of rockhopper penguins at several other localities also have been attributed to inadequate food. Rockhopper penguins at Marion Island continued to feed mainly on crustaceans during chick rearing. There was a marked increase in the contribution of fish to the diet in 1999/00 that coincided with an increase in mass at arrival at colonies of both males and females. Trends in numbers of pairs breeding in different sections of Marion Island were not always consistent, indicating the need for island-wide monitoring to establish the overall trend.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.05.012},
	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies and meanders have been shown to be one of the dominant sources of flow variability in the world's ocean. One example of an isolated eddy hotspot is the South-West Indian Ridge (SWIR). Several investigations have shown that the SWIR and the corresponding planetary potential vorticity field (f/H) exert a strong influence on the location and dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), resulting in substantial fragmentation of the jets downstream of the ridge. The easterly extension of this eddy corridor appears to be restricted to the deep channel separating the Conrad Rise from the Del Cano and Crozet Plateau. However, while the fate of eddies formed at the SWIR has been widely investigated and the frontal character of this eastward extension is well known, the zone of diminishing variability that extends southwards to approximately 60°S remains poorly sampled. Using a combination of Argo, AVISO and NCEP/NCAR datasets, the character of this eddy corridor as a conduit for warm core eddies to move across the ACC into the Antarctic zone is investigated. In this study, we track a single warm-core eddy as it moves southwards from an original position of 31°E, 50°20'S to where it dissipates 10 months later in the Enderby Basin at 56°20'S. An Argo float entrained within the eddy confirms that its water masses are consistent with water found within the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone north of the APF. Latent and sensible heat fluxes are on average 8W/m2 and 10W/m2 greater over the eddy than directly east of this feature. It is estimated that the eddy lost an average of 5W/m2 of latent heat and 5W/m2 of sensible heat over a 1-year period, an amount capable of melting approximately 0.92m of sea ice. In addition, using an eddy tracking algorithm a total of 28 eddies are identified propagating southwards, 25 of which are anti-cyclonic in rotation. Based on the new Argo float data, combined with AVISO and NCEP/NCAR datasets, these results suggest that the southward passage of warm-core eddies act as vehicles transporting heat, salt and biota southwards across the ACC and into the eastern boundary of the Weddell gyre.},

	abstract = {Marine mammal depredation on fisheries (animals removing fish caught on fishing gear) is a worldwide issue involving socio-economic and ecological consequences. Longline fisheries are the most impacted by odontocete (toothed whales) depredation. While technological means have provided limited efficacy in reducing depredation, this study examined the fishing practices influencing both the proportion of depredated longline sets and the amount of fish removed by whales. We used an 8-year dataset from the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fisheries operating in Crozet and Kerguelen Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs) (South Indian Ocean) and GLMMs to investigate sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation. Sperm whale depredation occurred on 61\% of 5260 sets in Crozet and 41\% of 16,902 sets in Kerguelen, and resulted in minimum estimated toothfish losses of 702 tons and 2649 tons, respectively, in the two areas. The probability of depredation decreased in winter months, increased with depth fished and decreased when vessels travelled over distances of {\textgreater}60 km from fishing grounds with encountering depredation. These findings suggest the natural spatio-temporal distribution of sperm whales and their ability to follow vessels over limited ranges influence the number of captured fish removals. The amount of depredated toothfish decreased with the speed at which longline sets were hauled and increased with the soaking time of sets suggesting that whales may depredate sets during both hauling and soaking operations. Together, these observations indicate that rates of depredation may be influenced by the conditions of fishing operations and could therefore be employed to implement strategies of avoidance in all fisheries facing similar depredation impacts.},

Using a suite of 24 indicators, we evaluated the current status of biological invasions and their management on the Prince Edward Islands, South Africa’s sub-Antarctic territories, and provide recommendations for management. There are 45 established alien taxa on Marion Island, of which 25 are invasive, and nine invasive taxa on the less frequently visited Prince Edward Island. However, despite stringent biosecurity, new alien taxa continue to arrive, potentially through ten introduction pathways, but particularly as contaminants on goods and stowaways on transport vectors. Not all detected taxa have been systematically recorded or identified—identifying incursions to species level may help pinpoint gaps in biosecurity. Three invasive plant species have caused Major environmental impacts (as per the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa categories), and Massive impacts have been recorded for the house mouse. An ambitious plan to eradicate the house mouse is being developed. A further eight taxa are controlled and four monitored to determine whether they have been eradicated. We argue that systematically tracking and documenting biological invasions is vital to improve the appropriateness, adaptability, and responsiveness of management; and we recommend a dedicated, integrated reporting process involving all stakeholders. Such monitoring is particularly important for remote sites given competing demands to reduce the human footprint, manage biological invasions, and allow access.

House mice Mus musculus are known predators of seabird chicks, and there is growing concern about their attacks on adult birds. On sub-Antarctic Marion Island, the single largest breeding site for wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, invasive mice, the sole introduced mammal, pose an escalating threat to this Vulnerable species. We report the first direct evidence of mice attacking adult wandering albatrosses, and record mouse attacks on adult wandering albatrosses beyond the localised incidents reported in 2023. Of 2,979 wandering albatross nests counted island-wide in January 2024, 2,295 remained active in April, with 1,102 attended by adults brooding or guarding chicks. Of these, 11 adults (1\%) exhibited mouse-inflicted wounds (including a scalp injury, as well as the more common wing joint wounds), and two fresh adult carcasses were discovered. Injured adults and carcasses were distributed across all wandering albatross breeding colonies. Wounds predominantly affected males (10 of 11); one adult succumbed to its injuries within six weeks. The 11 nests with injured adults had a 45\% breeding success rate, below the island-wide average of 61\%. At Cape Davis, where mice were first recorded attacking adults in 2023, breeding success was just 28\%. This expansion in attack range and severity underscores the urgent need to eradicate mice from Marion Island to conserve wandering albatrosses and other threatened biota.},

The House Mouse Mus musculus is the only introduced mammal species on sub-Antarctic Gough and Marion Islands. Ample evidence exists of mice preying upon seabird chicks on these two islands, but there have been only a few reports of attacks on adult seabirds, none of which has been fatal. We report the first deaths of adult great albatrosses due to mouse attacks. On Gough Island, three Tristan Albatrosses Diomedea dabbenena (Critically Endangered) brooding small chicks were observed with wounds typical of mouse attacks in March–April 2021; two likely abandoned their chick, causing breeding failure, and the third was found dead eight days after discovery with large blowfly larvae in the wound. On Marion Island, two wounded and eight dead adult Wandering Albatrosses D. exulans (Vulnerable) were found in April 2023. Inspection of the wounded individuals, as well as the injuries on the fresh carcasses strongly suggest that mouse predation was the cause of death. Gough Island is home to virtually all Tristan Albatrosses, and Marion Island is the single most important breeding site for Wandering Albatrosses, home to about a quarter of all breeding birds. The death of breeding adults of these long-lived species emphasizes the urgent need to eradicate introduced mice from these islands.},

	abstract = {The updating and rethinking of vegetation classifications is important for ecosystem monitoring in a rapidly changing world, where the distribution of vegetation is changing. The general assumption that discrete and persistent plant communities exist that can be monitored efficiently, is rarely tested before undertaking a classification. Marion Island (MI) is comprised of species-poor vegetation undergoing rapid environmental change. It presents a unique opportunity to test the ability to discretely classify species-poor vegetation with recently developed objective classification techniques and relate it to previous classifications. We classified vascular species data of 476 plots sampled across MI, using Ward hierarchical clustering, divisive analysis clustering, non-hierarchical kmeans and partitioning around medoids. Internal cluster validation was performed using silhouette widths, Dunn index, connectivity of clusters and gap statistic. Indicator species analyses were also conducted on the best performing clustering methods. We evaluated the outputs against previously classified units. Ward clustering performed the best, with the highest average silhouette width and Dunn index, as well as the lowest connectivity. The number of clusters differed amongst the clustering methods, but most validation measures, including for Ward clustering, indicated that two and three clusters are the best fit for the data. However, all classification methods produced weakly separated, highly connected clusters with low compactness and low fidelity and specificity to clusters. There was no particularly robust and effective classification outcome that could group plots into previously suggested vegetation units based on species composition alone. The relatively recent age (c. 450,000 years B.P.), glaciation history (last glacial maximum 34,500 years B.P.) and isolation of the sub-Antarctic islands may have hindered the development of strong vascular plant species assemblages with discrete boundaries. Discrete classification at the community-level using species composition may not be suitable in such species-poor environments. Species-level, rather than community-level, monitoring may thus be more appropriate in species-poor environments, aligning with continuum theory rather than community theory.},

	abstract = {Questions At high latitudes, anthropogenic climate change and invasive species threaten biodiversity, often with interacting effects. Climate change not only impacts native plant species directly by driving distribution and abundance of species, but indirectly through the influence on community dynamics and habitat suitability to invasive species. A key obstacle to quantifying vegetation change in the sub-Antarctic is the scarcity of cloud-free satellite imagery in a region with near-permanent cloud cover and lack of long-term plot data. In this paper, we aim to address the following questions: how has vegetation in the sub-Antarctic changed between 1965 and 2020? What are the roles of climate change and invasive species in driving these changes? Location The study was conducted on Marion Island in the sub-Antarctica. Methods We quantified vegetation change by analysing repeat ground photography between 1965 and 2020, accompanied by an analysis of climate trends and invasive plant species’ cover changes over the same period. Results Total vegetation cover was significantly higher in 2020 than in 1965 in all habitats other than in the coastal saltspray habitat, indicating an increase in overall biomass on the island. The more responsive ‘generalist’ plant species have expanded across the island, whilst the more ‘specialised’ plant species have not significantly changed in cover, with the exception of the mire graminoids, which have declined. Marion Island has thus undergone significant vegetation change, showing a greening trend across most habitats in the last five decades. This has been accompanied by aridification, an increase in mean air temperature, changes in wind direction and wind speed, and an increase in invasive mouse populations. The three most widespread invasive plant species have also expanded their ranges, especially in areas influenced by animal disturbance and nutrient input. Conclusions In congruence with research from Northern-hemisphere tundra and other islands in the sub-Antarctic, these results provide substantive empirical evidence for the interacting effects of climate change and invasive species on sub-Antarctic tundra vegetation, as has long been predicted.},

	abstract = {Despite concerns about the richness of plant invaders on islands, and their likely effects on local systems, impacts of these species seem to be small. However, this may be due to an absence of information on impacts, including changing species occupancy and forecast occupancy, rather than lack of impact per se. Here we use the plant invaders on the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and spatially explicit modeling of presence–absence survey data to demonstrate that the geographic extent of many invasives is increasing and is forecast to lead to occupancy of {\textgreater}60\% of the islands’ surface area by 2060, with ongoing climate change. In keeping with theory, proximity to human activity, neighboring populations (i.e. propagule pressure) and residence time, along with more minor contributors such as elevation, explain {\textgreater}50\% of the variation in the occupancy of each of the six main invasive species on the islands. Human disturbance and changing climates seem to have led to recent increases in the rate of range expansion. Our results suggest that impacts of island plant invaders may be more significant than previously estimated, largely owing to prior data deficiency. More specifically they also suggest that control plans for the PEI (and other Southern Ocean Islands, SOIS) should first target less widely distributed species, which are invasive elsewhere. They also indicate that for the other SOIS, and for Antarctica, surveillance and anticipatory control plans should be in place.},

More comprehensive studies, including analyses of climate variability, extremes and aggregate changes in the climate system, can improve the understanding of the nature, and therefore possible consequences, of recent changes in climate. Here climate trends on the sub-Antarctic Marion Island are documented (between 1949 and 2003) in more detail than previously. Significant trends in biologically-relevant, and previously unexplored, parameters were observed, and the potential ecological consequences of these changes discussed. For example, the decline in precipitation experienced on the island comprises a trend for longer dry spells punctuated by fewer and smaller precipitation events. This more detailed understanding of the island’s drying trends enables more accurate predictions about its impacts, including, for example, particularly severe effects on plant species growing in soils with poor water-holding capacity. Therefore, in addition to changes in average conditions, more inclusive climate analyses should also examine trends in climatic variability and extremes, for individual climate parameters as well as for the climate system as a whole.},

	abstract = {Background : The sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), South Africa’s southernmost territories have high conservation value. Despite their isolation, several alien species have established and become invasive on the PEIs.   Objectives : Here we review the invasion ecology of the PEIs.   Methods : We summarise what is known about the introduction of alien species, what influences their ability to establish and spread, and review their impacts.   Results : Approximately 48 alien species are currently established on the PEIs, of which 26 are known to be invasive. Introduction pathways for the PEIs are fairly well understood – species have mainly been introduced with ship cargo and building material. Less is known about establishment, spread and impact of aliens. It has been estimated that less than 5\% of the PEIs is covered by invasive plants, but invasive plants have attained circuminsular distributions on both PEIs. Studies on impact have primarily focussed on the effects of vertebrate invaders, of which the house mouse, which is restricted to Marion Island, probably has the greatest impact on the biodiversity of the islands. Because of the risk of alien introductions, strict biosecurity regulations govern activities at the PEIs. These are particularly aimed at stemming the introduction of alien species, and are likely to have reduced the rates of new introductions. In addition, some effort is currently being made to eradicate selected range-restricted species. However, only one species that had established and spread on the PEIs, the cat, has been successfully eradicated from the islands.   Conclusion : Given the ongoing threat of introductions, and the impacts of invaders, it is essential that future invasions to the PEIs are minimised, that the islands’ management policies deal with all stages of the invasion process and that a better understanding of the risks and impacts of invasions is obtained.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00320508},
	abstract = {At the Prince Edward Islands, temperatures have increased by approximately 1°C over the past 40 years, accompanied by a decline in precipitation. This has led to a reduction in the peat moisture content of mires and higher growing season "warmth". The temperature-and moisture-sensitive sedge, Uncinia compacta R. Br. (Cyperaceae), has consequently increased its aerial cover on Prince Edward Island, but harvesting of seeds by feral house mice (up to 100\% removed) has prevented this from happening on Marion Island. Such extensive use of resources suggests that prey switching may be taking place at Marion Island. Scat analyses revealed that mice are·not only eating ectemnorhinine weevils to a greater extent than found in previous studies of populations at Marion Island, but that they also prefer larger weevils (±6 mm). A decrease in body size of preferred weevil prey species [Bothrometopus randi Jeannel and Ectemnorhinus similis C.O. Waterhouse (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)] has taken place on Marion Island (1986-1992), but not on Prince Edward Island. This appears to be a result of increased predation on weevils. In addition, adults of the prey species, E. similis are relatively more abundant on Prince Edward Island than adults of the smaller congener E. marioni Jeannel, and could not be found on Marion Island in the late austral summer of 1991. These results not only provide support for previous hypotheses of the effect of global warming on mouse-plant-invertebrate interactions on the Prince Edward Islands, but also provide limited evidence for the first recorded case of predator-mediated speciation. They also show that the interaction of human-induced changes operating at different scales may have profound consequences for local systems.},

To address this issue, we systematically mapped the distribution of a keystone, cushion plant species, Azorella selago, and mouse damage to it across Marion Island. Mouse damage was observed in a third of the sampled sites from sea level to 548 m a.s.l. Damage to individual cushions ranged from single burrows to the disintegration of entire cushions. Mouse damage was high in sites with low A. selago density, suggesting that in areas of low cushion density the impact of mice may be substantial. Moreover, it is not simply direct impacts on the A. selago population that are ecologically significant. Azorella selago cushions serve as nurse plants for many epiphyte species, so increasing the altitudinal range of a variety of them, and also house high densities of invertebrates especially in fellfield landscapes. In consequence, this study demonstrates that mice are having a significant, negative impact at the landscape scale on Marion Island, so adding to the growing list of species and ecosystem-level effects attributable to this invasive rodent.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the stomach contents of house mice (Mus musculus L.) at three sites on Marion Island (47°S, 38°E) over a 1-year period showed that the mice feed mostly on terrestrial macroinvertebrates but that plants (mainly seed) are an important component of the diet in mid- to late summer. Larvae of a flightless moth, weevil larvae and adults and, at one of the sites, earthworms were the invertebrate items that showed the highest importance value over the year. Diet diversity was slightly lower in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. Diet variety was lowest in midsummer and highest in either autumn or winter, depending on the site. Mean stomach-content mass was significantly higher in midwinter than during the rest of the year. When offered prey of different types and sizes, mice selected moth larvae first in 92\% of the trials; earthworms or weevil adults were most frequently selected second, and weevil larvae fourth. An introduced slug species was selected only once, as the last choice and only part of it was eaten. With both moth larvae and earthworms, the heaviest individual offered was almost always chosen first. Surprisingly, mice never consumed more than about half of the seed offered to them and their condition deteriorated severely during the trials with seed; in a third of the trials with two types of seed, the mice completely ignored the seed. The impact of mice predation on invertebrates was assessed at two of the sites – a dry mire and a coastal biotic herbfield that is influenced by seabird and seal manuring. Moth larvae and adults, weevil larvae and adults, earthworms, spiders and flies made up {\textgreater}90\% of the animal remains in the stomach contents over the year and, on average, the mice daily consumed 45 g (dry mass) ha–1 of those invertebrates at the mire and 194 g ha–1 at the biotic site. Moth larvae made up a substantial proportion of these amounts; average daily consumption was 30 g ha–1 at the mire and 107 g ha–1 at the biotic site. In terms of the amount consumed in relation to biomass, the heaviest impact of mice at both sites was on weevil adults; at the biotic site mice daily consumed 13\% of weevil adult biomass in autumn and nearly 6 times the annual average biomass over the year. At the mire, slightly more than the annual average weevil adult biomass was consumed over the year. The consumption of invertebrates by mice found in this study (1992/1993) was about 20\% greater than in 1979/1980. The most striking changes in annual average consumption rate between 1979/1980 and 1992/1993 were for weevil larvae (increased nearly fourfold) and earthworms (increased sixfold at the biotic site and threefold at the mire). In contrast, the consumption of spiders at both sites decreased between 1979/1980 and 1992/1993.},
