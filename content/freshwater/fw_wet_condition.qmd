**Inland wetland ecosystems are in poor condition, even in our protected areas. Lack of sufficient field collected information makes it hard to protect them properly, so improving how we monitor their health is crucial. It is concerning that South Africa's wetlands are degrading faster than we can rehabilitate them.**

<!-- jock plse help with Figure 1. Inland Wetland ecological condition and inset donut graph of ecological condition classes by number of types. Please use attribute field "EC22_all" to find condition values A-F. However, please group into 3 classes "Natural/near-natural (A/B)" + "Moderately Modified (C)" + "Severely modified (D/E/F)". Do you have the colour code for these three classes? See the screenshot. Please could you add a donut graph for # of wetland types in each of the 3 classes. "C:\Users\JobN\OneDrive - sanbi.org.za\NBA_data - nba_data\freshwater\wet_results_vector.gpkg"-->

Approximately x% of inland wetland extent and x% of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in natural (class A) or near-natural (class B) ecological condition. Approximately x% of inland wetland extent and x% of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in a moderately modified (class C) ecological condition and approximately x% of inland wetland extent and x% of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in severely modified (class D, E or F) ecological condition.

<!-- jock plse help with Figure 2. Inland Wetland Ecological Condition according to hydrogeomorphological (HGM) category and (a) the percentage of ecosystem types (labelled with their counts) in each ecological condition category; (b) the percentage of wetland extent (km^2^) in each ecological condition category. I started to attempt to do it myself by copying across the table from EPL. Please use attribute field "zone" for the hydrogeomorphological types and "EC22_all" to find condition values A-F. However, please group into 3 classes "Natural/near-natural (A/B)" + "Moderately Modified (C)" + "Severely modified (D/E/F)". Do you have the colour code for these three classes? See the screenshot.

Add text

Refer to DWS NWMF monitoring a subset of wetlands. Refer to dataset of field assessed wetlands contributing to national wetland map condition assessment. Desirable for future collaboration.

<!-- jock is it possible for the table / ie the coloured threat status part to be less compressed and to stretch across the page more? "unchannelled valley-bottom" could be two lines if this is what is causing the table to squash? -->

## Approach

Excellent progress has been made regarding automated condition assessments to support the NBA 2025 inland wetlands threat status; Text
