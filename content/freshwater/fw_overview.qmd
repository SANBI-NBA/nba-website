*Freshwater ecosystems – rivers and inland wetlands – are the lifeblood of South Africa, underpinning our water security, economy, and cultural heritage. However, more than 60% are in a compromised ecological condition. This places at risk the vital services they provide, and the incredible biodiversity they support. It is of great concern that the number of threatened freshwater species continues to rise.*

Rivers and inland wetlands are among the [most threatened](../integrated-findings/intf_ecosystems.qmd)[^1] and least protected ecosystems in South Africa. More than 64% of river ecosystem types and 65% of wetland ecosystem types are threatened ([Key Message B2](../key-messages/kmb2.qmd)).

[^1]: Ecosystem types and species are referred to as 'threatened' when they have been categorised as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable.

Over 30% (82/222) of **river** ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected (Not Protected). Over 20% (17/82) of **inland wetland** ecosystem types are both threatened and under-protected (Not Protected).

It follows that the **freshwater species** which these ecosystems support are increasingly highly threatened.

Over 36% of all assessed freshwater taxa and 66% of assessed endemic freshwater taxa are threatened, while 36% of all freshwater fishes and 66% of endemic freshwater fishes are threatened.

Freshwater fishes are the most threatened of all taxa in South Africa. With escalating pressures from human activities and climate change, it is highly concerning that 59 waterbird species have been uplisted, with 5 listed as Endangered, 11 Vulnerable and the remaining Near Threatened, while the African Shaggy Rat (previously African Marsh Rat) and the Laminate Vlei Rat have been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened during the current assessment. This is the first time that freshwater invertebrates have been included into the national biodiversity assessment.

In the face of increasing **pressures**, South African freshwater ecosystems continue to degrade faster than the investment in their conservation, management and rehabilitation. Key pressures include disruptions to the hydrological regime, deteriorating water quality ([Key Message A3](../key-messages/kma3.qmd)), direct habitat loss and biological invasions ([Key Message A4](../key-messages/kma4.qmd)), as well as the exacerbating effect of climate change ([Key Message A1](../key-messages/kma1.qmd)).

As freshwater ecosystems are affected by land use within their receiving catchment ([Key Message A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd)), they are not easily protected within nature reserves and, therefore, implementation of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs[^2]), ecological corridors and connectivity[^3] is vital. We must collaborate across all levels of society ([Key Message C1](../key-messages/kmc1.qmd)) to conserve and wisely manage our remaining intact rivers and inland wetlands, and the freshwater species that they support. We must take urgent **action** to increase attention and funding on freshwater ecosystems and species, and to implement restorative actions in strategically identified areas.

[^2]: Other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) are defined as "a geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in-situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio-economic, and other locally relevant values" (CBD, 2018).
