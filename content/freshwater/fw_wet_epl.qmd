*Protected areas play an important role in conserving representative and healthy functioning wetland ecosystems to ensure the continued existence of species and ecosystem types. However, inland wetland types are severely under-represented and under-protected in South Africa, with nearly 80% of wetland ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected. Freshwater-associated restoration efforts strategically implemented within protected areas continue to increase their effectiveness. However, achieving national conservation goals requires these efforts be amplified through a comprehensive network of conservation measures across the broader landscape.*

The proportion of South Africa’s total wetland extent under statutory protection (i.e. in categories[^1] recognised under the Protected Areas Act) at the time of this assessment is 23% (600 000 ha). Taking wetland ecological condition into consideration, approximately 5% of inland wetland ecosystem extent is Well Protected, 6% is Moderately Protected, 69% is Poorly Protected and 20% is Not Protected.

[^1]: Includes Forest Nature Reserve, Forest Wilderness Area, Marine Protected Area, Mountain Catchment Area, National Park, Nature Reserve, Protected Environment, Special Nature Reserve, World Heritage Site, as well as the sub-categories associated with each of these sites.

According to wetland type, 8 (10%) of inland wetland ecosystem types are Well Protected, 11 (13%) are Moderately Protected, 41 (50%) are Poorly Protected and 22 (27%) are Not Protected. Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape.

In terms of wetland hydrogeomorphic type, depression wetlands have the highest protection level, with 33% of depression wetland types and 37% of depression wetland extent considered to be Well Protected, while only 11% and 10% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are considered Well Protected. No unchannelled valley-bottom wetland types are considered Well Protected.

## Intersection of ecosystem threat status and protection levels

Combining the headline indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of wetland ecosystems. Although there has been positive progress in protecting inland wetland ecosystem types, the national protected area network could be strengthened to encompass a wider representation of South Africa’s inland wetlands and to afford protection to those that are Poorly Protected or Not Protected. Seventeen (20%) out of 82 inland wetland types are both highly threatened (i.e. Critically Endangered and Endangered) and under-protected (Not Protected or Poorly Protected). They are widespread, but found predominantly on the Highveld, along the eastern escarpment, in the Cape Fold Mountains and the arid Northern Cape.

## Important note on work in progress

The wetland ecosystem protection level analysis is built on a robust interim wetland ecosystem typology. However, the refinement of the national wetland ecosystem typology was still underway at the time of this assessment. This ongoing process to refine the interim typology into more detailed, validated subtypes is being undertaken in collaboration with multiple research partners. It will soon result in minor adjustments and an updated assessment, which will be widely communicated.

<!--# ::: {#box-1 .callout-note .freshwater title="Box 1. Primary Catchments and Inland Wetland Ecosystem Protection Level" collapse="true"}
South Africa supports 22 primary catchments which are further grouped into six Water Management Areas. These are the Vaal-Orange, Pongola-Umzimkhulu, Mzimvubu-Tsitsikamma, Limpopo-Olifants, Breede-Olifants, and Inkomati-Usuthu. Each WMA is managed by an established or in process Catchment Management Agency responsible for overseeing the allocation, protection, and conservation of water resources in the catchment.

To support the consideration of biodiversity into emerging Catchment Management Strategies and implementation plans, the inland wetland ecosystem threat status headline indicator is presented according to the 22 primary catchments and associated Water Management Area.

::: {#box-2 .callout-note .freshwater title="Box 2. Inland Wetland Ecosystem Protection Level across the Provinces" collapse="true"}
The national status of inland wetland ecosystems is summarised according to each of the nine provinces and can serve as foundational information to support provinces as they prepare their state of environment reports and other freshwater biodiversity planning initiatives.

Table 2.1. Ecosystem Protection Level of inland wetlands across the provinces of South Africa.

In the face of prevailing financial and capacity constraints to implementing large-scale inventory across the country, there is a focus on expanding the mapping and validation of extent, ecological condition and characteristics of wetlands within Provincial Nature Reserves, ultimately contributing to the continuous refinement of the national wetland map. The current data reflects ongoing collaborative efforts between national and provincial agencies.

Wetlands of International Importance, designated in accordance with the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, are places of globally significant biodiversity and embody South Africa's commitment to conserve and ensure the wise use of its wetland ecosystems for the benefit of all humanity.

\![Mahanga Pan, April 2021, Makuleke Wetlands Ramsar Site. © SANParks\]

The total area under the Ramsar Convention in South Africa is approximately 300 000 ha or 0.5% of total wetlands in South Africa. Of the 31 Ramsar Sites in South Africa, 17 sites contain inland wetlands. Although Ramsar sites range widely from one wetland to multiple wetlands, sometimes with a mix of estuary, river, inland wetland and marine aquatic ecosystems all within one designated site, only inland wetlands are calculated per site for the purposes of this report. See here for information on the full suite of South Africa's Ramsar sites.

Figure 4.1. Ramsar sites of South Africa

Ramsar wetland sites are provided a level of protection in that they require management plans and are afforded greater protection through higher water allocations through the National Water Act (Chapter 3). The majority (92%) of Ramsar inland wetlands fall within Protected Areas. They amount to 14 133 ha (x%) of the total of inland wetland wetlands within protected area in South Africa and x% of the extent of all inland wetlands. Approximately 936.6 ha (7.4%) of Ramsar inland wetlands do not overlap with the formal protected area network.

## Approach

Ecosystem protection level is a headline indicator of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented within South Africa’s protected area network[@governmentofsouthafrica.2003]. Read more about this indicator on the [ecosystem protection level](../integrated-findings/chl_epl_explained.qmd) explainer page.

Key input layers include the South African protected areas database[@southafricanprotectedareasdatabase2024], the [wetland ecosystem types](./fw_wet_type.qmd), and [wetland ecological condition](./fw_wet_condition.qmd) assessment.

While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target for freshwater[@roux2008] ecosystems, the current protection level target was adjusted to 30% in line with Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework. This target is applied to each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types. Importantly, the current ecological condition of the wetland within the protected area is taken into consideration in the calculation, ensuring that effectiveness is accounted for. At least 30% of each inland wetland ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition (ecological class A or B) to qualify in the Well Protected category. If this target was not met, the ecosystem type is categorised as Moderately Protected or lower, meaning that good condition wetlands contribute more to meeting protection level targets than poor condition wetlands.

Ecosystem types were assigned to one of four categories based on the percentage of the protection target met within the protected areas network, and scaled by ecological condition (@tbl-eplcon): **Well Protected**: 100% (or more) of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; but only wetlands in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; **Moderately Protected**: 50% to 99% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and wetlands in an A and B condition contribute 100%, wetlands in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition wetlands contribute only 10%; **Poorly Protected**: 5% to 49% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition wetlands contribute 10%; **Not Protected**: less than 5% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the protected area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.

![Ecosystem protection level categories and the use of ecosystem condition data to moderate contribution to targets.](imgs/EPL_table.png){#tbl-eplcon width="600"}

Changes in ecosystem protection level results since the 2018 assessment reflect revised targets and improved methodologies for global and national alignment, alongside genuine changes in protection and updates to inland wetland ecological condition and mapping of wetland extent.
