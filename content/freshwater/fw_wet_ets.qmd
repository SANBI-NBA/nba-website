*Inland wetlands remain highly threatened, placing the vital services they provide and the incredible biodiversity they support at great risk. Often overlooked, this assessment has highlighted the plight of depression wetlands as one of our most threatened and vulnerable wetland ecosystem types, while the continued loss and degradation of peatlands remains of great concern.*

![South Africa's iconic peatlands are more vulnerable to drying out, fire and erosion when their water level is lowered for sustained periods. It is considerably more expensive to restore wetlands than to conserve them and, in the case of peatlands, it would take thousands of years for new peat to form.

Threatened wetland extent constitutes approximately 2.3 million ha (86%) of the more than 2.6 million hectares of inland wetlands mapped at the time of NBA 2025. Approximately 20% of wetland extent is Critically Endangered, 21% is Endangered, and 45% is Vulnerable. The remaining 14% is assessed as Least Concern.

Of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types assessed 60 are threatened (73%), with 15 types Critically Endangered (18%), 20 types Endangered (24%), and 25 types Vulnerable (30%). The remaining 22 (28%) wetland types are Least Concern. Threatened wetland ecosystem types are spread widely across South Africa, while Critically Endangered and Endangered wetlands are clustered within the central Free State and extending into central NorthWest Province, central Northern Cape, the Swartland of the Western Cape, the mining belt of Limpopo Province and the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal.

In terms of wetland hydrogeomorphic type, depression wetlands are the most threatened (24% of types threatened), followed by floodplains (17% of types threatened) and unchannelled valley-bottom wetlands (17% of types threatened), and seep wetland types (15% of types threatened) considered Threatened. Approximately 14% of depression wetland types and 19% of depression wetland extent is considered to be Critically Endangered, while 2% of seep wetland types, 1% of unchannelled valley-bottom wetland types and no floodplain types are considered Critically Endangered. <!-- add some dscription of this big difference in threat status for the different hgm zones, alignment with farming or mountains whatevewr ) -->

<!--# ::: {#box-1 .callout-note .freshwater title="Box 1. Inland wetland ecosystem threat status across primary catchments" collapse="true"}
South Africa supports 22 primary catchments which are further grouped into six Water Management Areas (WMA). These are the Vaal-Orange, Pongola-Umzimkhulu, Mzimvubu-Tsitsikamma, Limpopo-Olifants, Breede-Olifants, and Inkomati-Usuthu. Each WMA is managed by an established or in process Catchment Management Agency responsible for overseeing the allocation, protection, and conservation of water resources in the catchment.

To support the consideration of biodiversity into emerging Catchment Management Strategies and implementation plans, the inland wetland ecosystem threat status headline indicator is presented according to the 22 primary catchments and associated Water Management Area.

The national status of inland wetland ecosystems is summarised according to each of the nine provinces and can serve as foundational information to support provinces as they prepare their state of environment reports and other freshwater biodiversity planning initiatives.

In parentheses is the number of wetland ecosystem types per category per province (note these do not sum to a national number of threatened ecosystems as ecosystem types cross provincial boundaries). ![](imgs/ETS_wet_province_tbl.png)

The current data reflects ongoing collaborative mapping and data-sharing efforts between national and provincial agencies.

<!-- In the face of prevailing financial and capacity constraints to implementing large-scale inventory across the country, there is a focus on expanding the mapping and validation of extent, ecological condition and characteristics of wetlands within Provincial Nature Reserves, ultimately contributing to the continuous refinement of the national wetland map.

## Important note on work in progress

The wetland ecosystem threat status analysis is built on a robust interim wetland ecosystem typology and an automated assessment of wetland ecological condition. The automated wetland ecological condition is a major step forward in repeatability and opportunity for ongoing improvement. It mirrors the categories and framework adopted by practitioners undertaking assessments in the field and sets in place great potential for teasing out drivers of degradation from the perspective of wetland hydrology, water quality, geomorphology or vegetation change, and the development of specific management responses. Going forward, work remains for wide expert engagement to continue inform future wetland ecological condition assessments. The refinement of the national wetland ecosystem typology was still underway at the time of this assessment. This ongoing process to refine the interim typology into more detailed, validated sub-types is being undertaken in collaboration with multiple research partners. It will soon result in minor adjustments and an updated assessment, which will be widely communicated. 

## Approach

Ecosystem threat status is a headline indicator established to assess how close an ecosystem type is to collapsing (losing vital aspects of its structure, function, or composition). It serves as an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact.

Key input layers include [wetland ecosystem types](fw_wet_type.qmd) and [wetland ecological condition](fw_wet_condition.qmd).

The assessment was conducted using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework (version 2), which has been applied across all realms for the 2025 assessments. The framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the equivalent endpoint to species extinction. It evaluates the status of each ecosystem type using a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria linked to the key aspects of ecosystem decline, namely, Criterion A: reduction in extent, Criterion B: restricted distribution, Criterion C: environmental degradation and Criterion D: biotic degradation. Read more about this indicator on the [About ecosystem threat status page](../integrated-findings/chl_rle_explained.qmd).

The following criteria were assessed for inland wetland ecosystems:

-   **Criterion A2b** current and future rate of decline in ecosystem extent, assessed based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022, and projected forward to 2040.

-   **Criterion A3** historical decline in ecosystem extent, assessed based on land cover 2022, compared to historical potential extent.

-   **Criterion B1ai** restricted extent of occurrence coupled with decline was calculated, with ongoing decline defined as a habitat loss rate of decline of \>= 0.4% per year calculated from land cover change data.

-   **Criterion B1aii** restricted extent of occurrence coupled with decline was calculated, with ongoing decline defined as a decline in the extent of good/moderate ecological condition wetland extent (PES Classes A, B, C) from the previous PES assessment period (2018 - 2024).

-   **Criterion D2b** was applied using the rate of change in condition between 2018 and 2024, projected forward to 2068 (a 50 year period).

-   **Criterion D3** was applied to the wetland ecological condition (PES) category (A-F) such that severity of biotic disruption of \>= 90% was assumed for PES categories E-F; Severity \>=70% was assigned to PES categories D-F; Severity \>=50% was assigned to PES categories C-F. The rating was applied to each element of PES, namely, vegetation, water quality, geomorphology, hydrology, and the overall Wet-Health score that combines these elements.

Each wetland ecosystem type was assessed against these criteria and the **highest risk category** triggered by any single criterion was assigned as the overall ecosystem threat status for that type. Each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types was placed into one of four risk categories: **Critically Endangered**, **Endangered**, **Vulnerable**, or **Least Concern**. Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable are collectively referred to as the threatened categories.
