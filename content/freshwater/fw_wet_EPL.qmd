**Inland wetlands are severely under-protected, with just under 80% of wetland ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected (referred to as under protected). This is driven in part by poor ecosystem condition (only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem target).**

By area, approximately 5% of inland wetland ecosystem extent is Well Protected, 6% is Moderately Protected, 69% is Poorly Protected and 20% is Not Protected. When considered according to wetland type, nearly 50% of inland wetland ecosystem types (41 of 82) are Poorly Protected and 27% (22 of 82) are Not Protected.

Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape.

Approximately 55% of unchannelled valley-bottom types are Not Protected, while 32% and 33% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are Not Protected. Depression wetlands have the highest protection level, with 33% of ecosystem types and 37% of extent considered to be Well Protected, while 11% and 10% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are considered Well Protected.

Seventeen (20%) out of 82 inland wetland types are both threatened (i.e. CR, EN and VU) and under-protected (Not Protected). They are found on the Highveld, along the eastern escarpment, in the Cape Fold Mountains and the arid Northern Cape.

\[More text, prep an EPLI for wetlands?\]\[consider discussing highly threatened and least protected here, to guide where to focus protection going forward. also discuss rehabilitation as a means to improve protection level and further shift the EPLI\]

MZNP etc for rivers and wetlands it is essential to validate and feedback eg many wetlands are missed, rivers are mis classified and condition needs to be validated.

## Methods

Ecosystem Protection Level measures how well represented South Africa's inland wetland ecosystem types[^1] are within the Protected Areas[^2] network. Ecosystem Protection Level was calculated for each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types.

[^1]: River ecosystem types \[link to page\] are xxx.

[^2]: Protected Areas include xxx

**We measured whether 30% of every inland wetland ecosystem type falls within a Protected Area. This is the current "target" we have set for our inland wetland ecosystems.** For the previous National Biodiversity Assessment (2018), the Ecosystem Protection Level target was set at 20% for freshwater ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Ecosystem Protection Level target has been increased to 30% in the EPL calculations. The extent of each ecosystem type within the Protected Areas network is expressed as a proportion (target) of the total extent of that type. This target was met if 100% of an inland wetland ecosystem type target (i.e the entire 30%) falls within the Protected Area network.

**Importantly, the current condition of the wetland is also taken into consideration in the calculation.** Ecosystem condition for inland wetland ecosystems was derived through GIS automation of the Level 1A land use impact weightings outlined in WET-Health (MacFarlane et al. 2020). The resulting overall PES score (A to F) per wetland was used in the EPL calculation. This allowed for only good condition wetlands to be considered as representative of Well Protected status; while for MP PP and NP the condition of the wetland used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets - higher integrity / condition wetlands contribute more to meeting PA targets than low integrity / condition wetlands.

There are four classes of protection and they are calculated as follows: **Well** **Protected**: 100% of an inland wetland ecosystem type's target falls within the Protected Area network; but only wetlands in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; **Moderately Protected**: 50% to 99% of an inland wetland ecosystem type's target falls within the Protected Area network; and wetlands in an A and B condition contribute 100%, wetlands in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition wetlands contribute only 10%; **Poorly Protected**: 5% to 49% of an inland wetland ecosystem type's target falls within the Protected Area network; and A&B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%; **Not Protected**: less than 5% of a river ecosystem type's target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.
