## Summary {#summary}

**Inland wetlands face a multitude of pressures, including pollution from mines and wastewater treatment, infrastructure development, and changes in land use. While we \[don't yet have a full picture of all impacts\] how healthy our wetlands are, the signs are worrying. Most of these vital ecosystems are in poor condition, even in our protected areas. This lack of information makes it hard to protect them properly, so improving how we monitor their health is crucial. Furthermore, South Africa's wetlands are degrading faster than we can rehabilitate them.**

Kotze, D

***Wetlands are at the frontline of wastewater[\[1\]](#_ftn1) impacts*** given their location at the interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environments, especially in South Africa, with its generally poor performance of wastewater treatment works and declining state of catchment water quality (Rivers-Moore 2016; Edokpayi et al. 2018; Cullis et al. 2019; Sindane and Modley 2023). In the most recent national assessment, 68% of wastewater treatment works were identified as at high or critical risk of discharging partially treated or untreated water into the environment (DWS 2023).

***When using wetlands to enhance catchment water quality, the impacts on ecosystem services may be considerable**.* The use of wetlands to enhance water quality in polluted catchments has been well demonstrated (e.g. Verhoeven et al. 2006; Land et al. 2016; Jacklin et al. 2021). But a narrow focus on water quality objectives, will likely lead to failure to account more broadly for the impacts on wetland ecological health, ecosystem services supply and ultimately human wellbeing (Verhoeven et al. 2006; Convention on Wetlands 2021; Kotze 2023).

***Most ecosystem services provided by wetlands are negatively affected by wastewater inputs, except for rare instances where they are enhanced**.* One example is where nutrient-enriched wastewater promotes increased vegetation growth, which in turn increases the sediment carbon store in the wetland (Rybczyk et al. 2002; McCarthy and Venter 2006). Another example is when the prolonged hydroperiod and nutrient enrichment caused by the wastewater inputs may potentially enhance conditions for certain bird species, as occurred for the Lesser Flamingo (*Phoeniconaias minor*) at Kamfers Pan (Anderson 2015). These instances often occur in arid environments, such as the western parts of South Africa.

***The*** v***ulnerability of wetlands to wastewater impacts depends on (1) wetland type (2) the wastewater inputs; and (3) other uses of the wetland***. An inward draining (i.e. endorheic) wetland is inherently vulnerable as it has no outflow through which pollutants can be flushed from the system. High wastewater discharge with high loads of pathogenic bacteria impacts greatly on human wellbeing when use involves direct contact with the water, e.g. if used for conducting baptisms. If use of the wetland involves no direct contact with the water, e.g. as might be the case when observing water birds from a bird hide, the impacts in terms of human use would likely be less severe. Given the potential impacts and range in vulnerabilities, it is useful to distinguish between wetland areas and contexts which are most vulnerable to water quality impacts, and for which use should be kept to a minimum, and less vulnerable wetlands, which could potentially be designated as hard-working wetlands.

***The pollutant assimilation capacity of wetlands is finite, and overloading a wetland will result in severe consequences for the wetland and downstream water users**.* Sustained point-source pollution into a wetland can overwhelm a wetland’s assimilative capacity, severely compromising its capacity to deal with non-point sources of pollution (Verhoeven et al. 2006). In some cases where the initial effect of wastewater is positive, beyond a certain threshold its effect can dramatically shift to become negative, e.g. as occurred in the Kamfers Pan in 2011 when the sewage works was malfunctioning and many flamingos contracted avian pox virus through biting flies proliferating in the

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1)Wastewater is defined as “a combination of one or more of: domestic effluent consisting of blackwater (excreta, urine & faecal sludge) & greywater (kitchen & bathing wastewater); water from commercial establishments and institutions, including hospitals; industrial effluent, stormwater & other urban run-off; agricultural, horticultural & aquaculture effluent, either dissolved or as suspended matter (UN-Water 2015).”

highly nutrient-enriched waters of the pan (Anderson 2015) and which continues to recur (Ramollo 2016, 2018; Kemp 2024).

***Long-term accumulation of pollutants in the sediments of wetlands pose a risk should the wetland sediments dry out or their biogeochemistry change**.* If a considerable amount of metals or other pollutants have accumulated over many decades under prolonged saturation in a wetland’s sediments, much of this can be released on drying out of the wetland (McCarthy and Venter 2006; McCarthy et al. 2007). The wetland may rapidly ’flip’ from being a major sink for metals and other pollutants to becoming a major source.
