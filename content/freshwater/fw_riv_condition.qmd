*Rivers are among the most threatened ecosystems in South Africa, with over 60% of their extent in a compromised state. This has placed the vital services they provide and the incredible biodiversity they support at great risk.*

![Ecological condition for river ecosystem types. The inset graph shows percentage of river ecosystem types within each condition category.](imgs/riv_condition_map.png){#fig-condition_wet_map}

Only a third of the total length of river ecosystems in South Africa are in a natural/near-natural ecological condition, with two-thirds in a moderately modified or worse condition. Tributaries are almost equally heavily impacted as mainstem rivers; with 38% of tributary length in a natural/near-natural condition compared to 28% of mainstems. The extent of ecosystem modifications in the inland aquatic realm reflects the wide array of pressures that are concentrated in rivers and inland wetlands that negatively impact on ecosystems and species. \[Some text with a footnote[^1].\]

Ecological condition was calculated for 171 303 wetlands. Of these, approximately 1 476 561 ha (49%) of inland wetland extent and \# (58%) of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in natural (class A) or near-natural (class B) ecological condition. Approximately 808 325 ha (27%) of inland wetland extent and \# (x%) of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in a moderately modified (class C) ecological condition and approximately 705 797 (27%) of inland wetland extent and x% of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in severely modified (class D, E or F) ecological condition.

Of the different hydrogeomorphological types, depression wetlands are in the best ecological condition, with 14% of depression wetlands Severely Modified, 11% Moderately Modified and 76% in a Near-Natural or Natural ecological state. Floodplain, unchannelled valley-bottom, and seep wetlands all appear to have 42% Severely Modified wetland extent, with 34%, 35%, and 42% respectively in Near-Natural or Natural ecological condition. xxxxx

Wetlands are complex systems that influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Determining wetland ecological condition requires a multidisciplinary approach that allows for determining a single condition score from all the xxx/ While previous approaches to determine wetland condition at the national scale were sound, they lacked the wholistic and xxx approach of MacFarlane et al. (2020). The structured nature of this approach allows for a collaborative xxxx present ecological state (PES) scores, also allows for the inclusion of infield expert validated data that collect xxx approach for national wetland map assessment.

## Approach

Wetland ecological condition was determined using an automated approach (ArcGIS python scripts) of the Level 1A method described xxx MacFarlane et al. (2020), which is a low confidence, non-detailed approach that is suitable for assessing multiple wetlands xxx those of a national wetland inventory. In addition to being typed according to Ollis et al. 2013, the method also requires xxx wetland to have a 200 m buffer, as well as have its area of influence mapped. While the 200 m buffer is created by the automated process, the area of influence was created using a separate, but also automated, process. This allows the area of influence to be the actual wetland catchment, instead of buffers as were used during the previous NBA assessment (Van Deventer et al. 2019).

Overall wetland condition was calculated from the combined state of wetland hydrology, water quality, geomorphology, and vegetation, which were all calculated from the inferred pressures of different land cover classes (MacFarlane et al. 2020).

The systematic nature of the PES process allows for the development of a base dataset which can be augmented by expert data. xxx has been initiated through selected expert engagements with the National Wetland Map team, during which spatial extent, typing, and PES data were xxx for individual wetlands and wetland complexes. While the expert scores \[were not adopted\], they represent the first step xxx building a reference dataset that will directly and indirectly inform future wetland ecological condition assessments.

In addition to allowing for the rapid assessment of multiple wetlands, the automation of a standardised PES method xxx the opportunity for temporal analysis by applying land cover grids from different time periods as input data. This may potentially xxxx series analysis that will reveal not only the trajectory of change in wetland ecological condition over time, but also what is responsible for xxx.
