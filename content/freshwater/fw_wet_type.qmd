*South Africa’s globally recognised biodiversity richness also extends to inland wetlands. A wide range of climatic, geological and topographic settings have resulted in an exceptional diversity of wetland ecosystem types, from permanently saturated peatlands which accumulated in place over thousands of years, to ephemeral salt pans harbouring newly described aquatic invertebrate species. More than half of South Africa's wetlands are less than two hectares in size but are of outsized importance when functioning collectively across a catchment, especially within the semi-arid context. Wetlands improve water quality and control floods and they are water sources, habitats, and refuges for animals and people in times of drought, among many other benefits.*

South Africa is among the most water-scarce countries per capita in the world and has a high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall. Evapotransipiration significantly exceeds rainfall over most of the country. However, diverse water-bearing geology and the expression of groundwater-dependent wetlands, the extensive movement of water through catchments and hillslopes and highly variable river flow regimes have resulted in a relative scarcity, but surprisingly rich variety, of inland wetlands. The diversity of inland wetland ecosystem types is underpinned by South Africa's strongly contrasting bioclimatic zones, including the arid western interior (summer rainfall), the mesic eastern grassy biomes (summer rainfall), the arid western coastal regions (winter rainfall) and the mesic winter-rainfall southwestern Cape. 

## Work in progress

The map of wetland ecosystem types is a work in progress. We have an interim typology in place and are currently at work with several collaborators on an updated national system to understand and manage our wetlands as effectively as possible. The proposed typology update will contribute significantly towards conservation, management and conservation, ensuring the long-term health of wetlands and the benefits they provide to all South Africans.

The latest data indicates that inland wetlands cover 2.2% of South Africa’s surface area, though this is likely to be an underestimate. These wetlands are classified into 82 distinct ecosystem types on the basis of vegetation bioregions and hydrogeomorphic units.

## Mapping wetland extent

The National Wetland Map is the primary input layer for the NBA 2025 assessment and depicts the location and size (extent) of wetlands. Importantly, the National Wetland Map attempts to capture the historical extent of wetlands prior to human modification. 

The National Wetland Map is built up from a range of different data sources, from fundamental field mapping to digitising of satellite images. Since 2022, the National Wetland Map has incorporated information from an automated wetland probability map, which uses topographic modelling to estimate where wetlands are likely to occur and helps to map a larger area in a shorter amount of time and fill in unmapped areas.

Submissions from stakeholders make an important contribution to the dataset. The National Wetland Map team developed a framework and protocols for preparing and combining the data from different mapping methods and contributors into one consolidated dataset. 

Once the national wetland typology (see below) is stable, the information on historical extent will make it possible to assess and report on trends in wetlands over time.

## Classifying wetland types

Wetlands are first classified according to hydrogeomorphic type based on landform and hydrology. Drawing from Ollis et al. and Grenfell et al., four hydrogeomorphic types have been adopted for the NBA 2025 assessment. These are floodplains (a river or stream channel runs through the wetland), unchannelled valley-bottom wetlands, depressions and seep wetlands (fed by groundwater and hillslope water).

These are further divided into different regional wetland types. Aligning with the Global Ecosystem Typology allows reporting towards global processes.
