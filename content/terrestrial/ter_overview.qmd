South Africa's unique terrestrial biodiversity is globally recognised, with high species diversity and exceptional levels of endemism (especially for plants). The wide climatic range and varied geology and topography result in an equally diverse set of 463 terrestrial ecosystem types. This natural heritage supports vibrant rural and urban land uses, from farming to tourism to expanding cities, through essential ecosystem services. The steady loss of terrestrial habitat and decline in species populations to various human activities set against a backdrop of accelerating climate change paints an overall picture of decline in the biodiversity and ecosystem services on which we rely. Gains in protection of species and ecosystems (through biodiversity stewardship programs) and growing sustainable use and restoration efforts are a positive trend. Biodiversity inclusive spatial planning, a well established and formalised practice in South Africa, is a key tool in striking the balance between development and biodiversity.

Thirty percent of South Africa's terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as threatened, this translates to 11% of the remaining natural habitat. There has been an overall increase in the risk of collapse of terrestrial ecosystems since 2014. While a quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types are Well Protected the same percentage are Not Protected. The overall trend for protection is positive, with a steady increase in the Protected Areas network - primarily due to biodiversity stewardship programs.

The state of biodiversity is shaped by both current and historical pressures. Croplands cover a very large portion of the terrestrial realm (\>16%) but there has been limited expansion into natural areas in recent times. In contrast the expansion of settlements and mining are relevant both historically and currently. Certain activities, such as targeted poaching of succulent plant species **\[KMA6\]** and renewable energy installations represent new pressures on biodiversity. Climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity are increasingly prominent, with studies more clearly attributing species declines and landscape changes to temperature and rainfall regime change **\[KMA1\].**
