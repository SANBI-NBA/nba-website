*Terrestrial ecosystems and species face pressures from a range of human activities, including loss of natural habitat through intensive land uses (croplands, settlements, infrastructure, mining, plantations, and dams), invasive alien species, overuse of rangelands, pollution and waste, unsustainable biological resource use and climate change. These pressures interact in complex ways to impact biodiversity and disrupt important ecological processes.*

## Habitat loss

The loss of natural habitat is the single biggest cause of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the terrestrial environment. Outright loss of natural habitat takes place mainly as a result of conversion of natural vegetation for cultivation of croplands, mining, plantation forestry, human settlements and other infrastructure development [@skowno2021]. Patterns and trends linked to land-use and land cover change are closely linked to changes in terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem extent. Habitat loss is also usually associated with habitat fragmentation, which further impacts ecological functioning and viability of species, particularly in the context of climate change and biological invasions.

Based on the national land cover, 81% of South Africa (986 051 km^2^) was in a natural state in 1990 (@tbl-lc-matrix). By 2022 natural areas were estimated to have declined to 78% (946 090 km^2^). Habitat loss, as a result of historical (1750–1990) and recent (1990– 2022) clearing of natural habitat for field crops, horticultural crops and planted pastures, is the largest pressure on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity in South Africa and has affected 17% of the land area.

Clearing of natural habitat for new croplands between 1990 and 2022 amounted to 13 676 km^2^. The relatively mesic eastern portions of South Africa and the Fynbos and Renosterveld of the Cape lowlands were the most impacted by this clearing (@fig-rod). Built-up areas (including rural and urban settlements, industrial and commercial areas and large infrastructure) also contribute to natural habitat loss and currently cover over 2.9% of the country. The rate of habitat loss linked to new built-up areas is increasing, especially in Gauteng and along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and adjacent interior. Plantation forestry (including non-native pine, eucalyptus and acacia species) is an important historical driver of habitat loss in mesic grassland regions, in particular (covering 21 573 km^2^). However, the rate of habitat loss to plantations is decreasing. While the impact of mining as a direct driver of habitat loss is relatively low (2 534 km^2^) the cumulative impacts can be intense and persistent, and extend beyond the mine footprint. The increase in prospecting and mining applications across the country, coupled with illegal mining activities are a concern. For example, sand mining along the KwaZulu-Natal coast affects the habitat of temporarily closed estuaries (up to 9% of individual estuary extent); and 12 ecosystem types are known to be directly threatened by mining activities past and present. The long-term and accelerating impacts of mining, coupled with climate change are driving landscape-level environmental degradation along the west coast into Namaqualand ([#box-1](#box-1)).

## Rangeland degradation

In addition to land clearing related habitat loss, large portions of South Africa’s rangelands have seen extensive modifications from centuries of livestock, and more recently, wildlife farming. The ecological condition in these areas ranges from near-natural to critically modified depending on the degree to which ecosystem structure, function and composition have been altered through rangeland livestock and game management. Fire plays a crucial role in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna ecology; disruption of natural fire regimes (fire season, frequency and intensity) presents an important pressure on biodiversity. Biological invasions also impact rangelands and are discussed below. Unfortunately, there is currently limited spatial data with which to assess these impacts at the scale of ecosystem types, though various assessments of South African rangelands have shown that bush encroachment is widespread. Recent work indicates lower levels of use and an improvement in primary productivity and natural vegetation cover in some rangelands [@hoffman2018; @bell2021a; @venter2020].

## Biological invasions

Biological invasions, especially by invasive alien plants, are a major pressure on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the terrestrial realm. A national report is released every three years – providing a comprehensive assessment of ["The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa".](http://iasreport.sanbi.org.za/) The report details alien species introduction pathways, their distribution and abundance, their impacts and the various interventions that have been put in place[@sanbi2023].

Of the 1 715 terrestrial alien species recorded (or assumed to be present) in South Africa, 611 are known to be invasive, 117 are known to be naturalised but not invasive, and 482 are present, but not naturalised[@zengeya]. For the remainder (505 species), there is insufficient information to assign them to an introduction status category. While the majority of invasive species have relatively restricted distributions there are some (plants and birds in particular) that are widespread. Invasive species have a range of impacts on biodiversity, displacing indigenous species, disturbing habitats and disrupting ecosystem functioning[@vanwilgen2022]. Australian acacias, for example, can form closed canopy stands that exclude indigenous species, change fire regimes and impact surface water runoff, negatively impacting biodiversity and water catchment function. Herbaceous and succulent species such as Triffid Weed (*Chromolaena odorata*) can severely reduce rangeland productivity and thus the livelihoods of rural people; while invasive grasses such Reed Meadow (*Glyceria maxima*) and Giant Reed (*Arundo donax*) can dominate riparian areas and displace native species. Examples of severe impacts in other high-level taxa include competitive displacement and predation on native species by domestic cats (*Felis catus*) and from invasive birds such as Rose-ringed parakeet (*Psittacula krameria*), House crow (*Corvus splendens*), and Common Myna (*Acridotheres tristis*)[@bacher2025]. Overall, alien plants are the most diverse, widespread and damaging group of invaders in South Africa. Furthermore, it is clear that South Africa has a major alien plant invasion debt. Over half of the taxa that are present are plants, and the range of almost all invasive alien plants have increased significantly[@henderson2017]. This is a major cause for concern, as it clearly indicates that problems associated with alien species are set to increase.

## Climate change

Since the 2018 NBA, there has been a global acceleration in the rates of global warming, with 2024 exceeding the historic baseline by 1.5 °C for the [first time](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level#:~:text=The%20World%20Meteorological%20Organization%20(WMO)%20has%20confirmed,more%20than%201.5%C2%B0C%20above%20the%201850%2D1900%20average). The interior of southern Africa continues to warm faster than the global terrestrial mean[@serykh2025]. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change have become increasingly visible in most ecological processes with disruptions evident from the genetic to the landscape levels. Abiotic pressures affecting the terrestrial realm include increases in dry spell duration, mean and maximum temperatures, wind, wildfires, sea level; and increases in the frequency and intensity of storm surges, extreme rainfall events and both more frequent and hotter hot days[@engelbrecht2024]. Annual rainfall has both increased and decreased in different regions and overall changes in rainfall seasonality have been noted. Evidence of early impacts of climate change on species is rapidly accumulating, with 70 amphibian species contracting their geographic ranges, at least partly due to climate change impacts on freshwater systems. Large-scale die-offs of desert plant communities have been documented, along with shifting migration times and range contractions for bird species. Fynbos community composition has also been shown to have altered due to climate change. Over the past century one of the most pervasive structural changes observed has been an increase in the density and spread of woody species in grassy biomes. This global trend, known as bush encroachment or woody thickening, is widespread in southern African grasslands, open savannas and mixed grass/shrub ecosystems. Research has shown that a changing climate and rising CO~2~ are probable background drivers of extensive and broad-scale switches towards greater woody plant cover, but that other important drivers (fire and grazing/browsing) influence the rate of this change[@skowno2017; @venter2018; @white2024]. These widespread ecological shifts have triggered plant and animal community reorganisations, net declines in biodiversity and changes in landuse activities. These alarming shifts, which are projected to intensify rapidly as climate thresholds are exceeded, drive the urgent need for climate change mitigation and management of interacting change drivers[@cparmesan2023]. Climate impacts on biodiversity will be amplified by land transformation and biological invasions as discussed above. Since progressive climatic, CO~2~ and resulting biodiversity changes are now inevitable, a fundamental review of conservation objectives and desired outcomes that accommodate climate change impacts is essential, along with planning and implementation of targeted conservation interventions. These need to be supported by a wider array of long-term monitoring efforts, including the effectiveness of the new climate-smart conservation approaches.

Climate change and human activities are creating a "perfect storm" of degradation in the Richtersveld region of the Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot, where over 100 km^2^ of formerly species-rich vegetation has severely declined or been replaced by sparse desert grassland[@jürgens2025]. While localized anthropogenic impacts from livestock farming, mining, and road construction trigger initial vegetation loss and mobilize wind-borne sand and dust, these effects are amplified by climate change factors including an unprecedented nine-year drought (2011-2019), increased temperatures, and stronger winds that cause cascading desertification processes through soil erosion and sand burial. The interaction between these drivers has transformed productive silty soils into sandy desert soils, creating potentially irreversible regime shifts where Succulent Karoo flora is being replaced by Namib Desert species, representing an unprecedented southward expansion of desert ecosystems in this global biodiversity hotspot.

Perennial shrub cover (Mesembryanthemum pseudoschlichtianum) has been lost, leaving bare saline soils with occasional annual species. Decades of overgrazing by livestock in combination with intense drought between 2017 and 2019 have changed the topsoil structure and severely altered ecosystem function and composition.

## Biological resource use

Biological resource use directly targets specific wildlife species and includes the hunting and trapping of animals as well as the harvesting of plants. In South Africa, animals and plants are commonly used as traditional medicine for both the treating of ailments and for cultural purposes. The NBA 2018 reported that over 2 000 indigenous plant species have documented traditional medicinal uses. Some 656 medicinal plant species are common in trade and many are unsustainably harvested, with 184 species declining due to excessive use and 56 listed as threatened. Approximately 147 vertebrate species, representing about 9% of the total number of vertebrate species in South Africa, are traded for traditional purposes. Vultures are particularly threatened by cultural use and it has been estimated that 29% of local vulture deaths are due to harvesting for traditional purposes. Harvesting for traditional medicine has increased pressure on endemic species of reptiles, such as the Sungazer Lizard (*Smaug giganteus*). Expansion of human settlements, especially in areas bordering protected areas, has resulted in increased hunting intensity for bushmeat and/or traditional medicine and cultural regalia, with species including Leopard (*Panthera pardus*), Temminck’s Ground Pangolin (*Smutsia temmincki*i) and Oribi (*Ourebia ourebi*).

Illegal harvesting and trade of South Africa’s species is increasing ([key message A6](../key-messages/kma6.qmd)). Official seizures and analyses of online trade show that for reptiles, ornamental succulent and geophytic plants, and certain groups of insects the numbers of species and volumes of individuals are increasing. The poaching of rhinos continues to be a challenge with 9 500 southern white rhinoceroses (*Ceratotherium simum simum*; Near Threatened) poached between 2010 and 2023. More than 1.1 million succulent plants have been confiscated from poachers between 2020 and 2025, representing only an estimated 15% of the total poaching underway link (read more on the [plant page »](../species/sp_plants.qmd)). The increase in the illegal wildlife trade is a global trend with online commerce and social media platforms facilitating direct and rapid ability to negotiate deals.

## Other Pressures

Waste generated by mining, agriculture, energy production, manufacturing and urban settlements causes water pollution, soil pollution and air pollution, which impact on ecosystems, species and ecological processes – often substantial distances away from the original pollution source. Proactive mapping and management of noise sensitive areas is recommended while scientists continue to strengthen the knowledge for soundscapes and the impacts of noise pollution. Renewables energy installations are a new form of land use expanding throughout South Africa. Crucial for the just energy transition and supporting the reduction in reliance on fossil fuels, these developments present novel pressures on biodiversity and ecosystems and innovative [mitigation initiatives](https://www.birdlife.org.za/what-we-do/policy-and-advocacy/what-we-do/birds-renewable-energy) are being implemented with the industry.
