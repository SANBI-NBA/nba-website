------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terrestrial ecosystems and species face pressures from a range of human activities, including loss of natural habitat through intensive land uses (croplands, settlements, infrastructure, mining, plantations, and dams), invasive alien species, over utilisation of rangelands, pollution and waste, unsustainable biological resource use and climate change. These pressures interact in complex ways to impact biodiversity and disrupt important ecological processes (Key Messages [A1](../key-messages/kma1.qmd), [A2](../key-messages/kma2.qmd), [A4](../key-messages/kma4.qmd), [A6](../key-messages/kma6.qmd))

## Habitat loss

The loss of natural habitat is the single biggest cause of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the terrestrial environment. Outright loss of natural habitat takes place mainly as a result of conversion of natural vegetation for cultivation of croplands, mining, plantation forestry, human settlements and other infrastructure development [@skowno2021]. Patterns and trends linked to land-use and land cover change are closely linked to changes in terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem extent. Habitat loss is also usually associated with habitat fragmentation, which further impacts ecological functioning and viability of species, particularly in the context of climate change and biological invasions.

Based on the national land cover, 81% of South Africa (986 038 km^2^) was in a natural state in 1990 (Table 1). By 2022 natural areas were estimated to have declined to 78% (946 226 km^2^). Habitat loss, as a result of historical (1750–1990) and recent (1990– 2022) clearing of natural habitat for field crops, horticultural crops and planted pastures, is the largest pressure on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity in South Africa and has affected 17% of the land area.

Clearing of natural habitat for new croplands between 1990 and 2022 amounted to 13 676 km2. The relatively mesic eastern portions of South Africa and the Fynbos and Renosterveld of the Cape lowlands were the most impacted by this clearing (Figure 1). Built-up areas (including rural and urban settlements, industrial and commercial areas and large infrastructure) also contribute to natural habitat loss and currently cover over 2.9% of the country. The rate of habitat loss linked to new built-up areas is increasing, especially in Gauteng and along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and adjacent interior. Plantation forestry (including non-native pine, eucalyptus and acacia species) is an important historical driver of habitat loss, in mesic grassland regions in particular (covering 21 574 km^2^). Although new plantations are being established, the rate of habitat loss to this activity is decreasing. The impact of mining as a direct driver of habitat loss is relatively low (2 534 km^2^); however, the highly uneven distribution of mining areas means that the impacts are focussed on particular ecosystems, and the impacts are often persistent and extend well beyond the mined area.

## Rangeland degradation

In addition to land clearing related habitat loss, large portions of South Africa’s rangelands have seen extensive modifications from centuries of livestock farming. The ecological condition in these modified areas ranges from near-natural to critically modified depending on the degree to which ecosystem structure, function and composition have been altered through livestock and game management. Fire plays a crucial role in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna ecology; disruption of natural fire regimes (fire season, frequency and intensity) presents an important pressure on biodiversity. Biological invasions also impact rangelands (see below). Unfortunately, there is currently limited spatial data with which to assess these impacts at the scale of ecosystem types, though various assessments of South African rangelands have shown that bush encroachment is widespread (see below). Recent work indicates lower levels of utilization and an improvement in primary productivity and natural vegetation cover in some rangelands [@hoffman2018].

## Biological invasions

Biological invasions, especially invasive alien plants, are a major pressure on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the terrestrial realm. A national report is released every three years[@sanbi2024] – providing a comprehensive assessment of ["The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa".](http://iasreport.sanbi.org.za/) The report details alien species introduction pathways, their distribution and abundance, their impacts and the various interventions that have been put in place.

Of the **1 714** terrestrial alien species recorded (or assumed to be present) outside of cultivation or captivity in South Africa, **590** are known to be invasive, **113** are known to be naturalised but not invasive, and **529** are present, but not naturalised. For the remainder (**481** species), there is insufficient information to assign them to an introduction status category. While the majority of invasive species have relatively restricted distributions there are some (plants and birds in particular) that are widespread. Invasive species have a range of impacts on biodiversity, displacing indigenous species, disturbing habitats and disrupting ecosystem functioning. Australian acacias, for example, can form closed canopy stands that exclude indigenous species, change fire regimes and impact surface water runoff, negatively impacting biodiversity and water catchment function. Herbaceous and succulent species such as Triffid Weed (*Chromolaena odorata*) can severely reduce rangeland productivity and thus the livelihoods of rural people; while invasive shrubs such as Silky Hakea (*Hakea sericea*), can displace most other species and increase fire intensity – leading to soil damage and excessive erosion. Examples of severe impacts in other high-level taxa include the Garden Snail (*Cornu aspersum*) that causes damage to commercial and ornamental crops; and the Argentine Ant (*Linepithema humile*), which disrupts ant–plant mutualisms responsible for the seed dispersal of indigenous plants, and thus pose serious threats to indigenous vegetation survival. Overall, alien plants are the most diverse, widespread and damaging group of invaders in South Africa. Furthermore, it is clear that South Africa has a major alien plant invasion debt. Well over 100 new taxa have been recorded as naturalised or escaped from cultivation over the past decade and the recorded range of almost all plants have increased significantly. This is a significant cause for concern, as it clearly indicates that problems associated with alien species are set to increase.

## Climate change

Anthropogenic climate change has been shown to impact on most ecological processes with disruptions evident from the genetic level to the landscape level. Abiotic pressures affecting the terrestrial realm include increases in dry spell duration, mean and maximum temperatures, wind, wildfires, sea level; and increases in the frequency and intensity of storm surges, extreme rainfall events and very hot days. Annual rainfall has both increased and decreased in different regions and overall changes in rainfall seasonality have been noted. Evidence of early impacts of climate change on species is rapidly accumulating, with **70** amphibian species contracting their geographic ranges, at least partly due to climate change impacts on freshwater systems. Large scale die-offs of desert plant communities have been documented, along with shifting migration times and range contractions for bird species. Fynbos community composition has also been shown to have altered due to climate change. Over the past century one of the most pervasive structural changes observed has been an increase in the density and spread of woody species. This global trend, known as bush encroachment or woody thickening, is widespread in southern African grasslands, open savannas and mixed grass/shrub ecosystems. Research has shown that a changing climate and rising CO~2~ are probable background drivers of extensive and broad-scale switches towards greater woody plant cover, but that other important drivers (fire and grazing/browsing) influence the rate of this change[@skowno2017; @venter2018; @white2024]. These widespread ecological shifts have triggered plant and animal community reorganisations, net declines in biodiversity and changes in landuse activities. These alarming shifts drive the urgent need for climate change mitigation and management of interacting change drivers. Since progressive climatic, CO~2~ and resulting biodiversity changes are now inevitable, a review of conservation objectives and desired outcomes is essential, along with planning and implementation of targeted conservation interventions. These need to be supported by a wider array of long-term monitoring efforts, including of the effectiveness of the new conservation approaches required.

## Biological resource use

Biological resource use directly targets specific wildlife species and includes the hunting and trapping of animals as well as the harvesting of plants. In South Africa, animals and plants are commonly used as traditional medicine for both the healing of ailments and for cultural purposes. Over **2 000** indigenous plant species have documented traditional medicinal uses. Some **656** medicinal plant species are common in trade and many are unsustainably harvested, with 184 species declining due to excessive use and **56** listed as threatened. Approximately **147** vertebrate species, representing about 9% of the total number of vertebrate species in South Africa, are traded for traditional purposes. Vultures are particularly threatened by cultural use and it has been estimated that **29%** of local vulture deaths are due to harvesting for traditional purposes. Harvesting for traditional medicine has increased pressure on endemic species of reptiles, such as the Sungazer Lizard (*Smaug giganteus*). Expansion of human settlements, especially in areas bordering protected areas, has resulted in increased hunting intensity for bushmeat and/or traditional medicine and cultural regalia, with species including Leopard (*Panthera pardus*), Temminck’s Ground Pangolin (*Smutsia temmincki*i) and Oribi (*Ourebia ourebi*).

## Other Pressures

Waste generated by mining, agriculture, energy production, manufacturing and urban settlements causes water pollution, soil pollution and air pollution, which impact on ecosystems, species and ecological processes – often substantial distances away from the original pollution source.

Proactive mapping and management of noise sensitive areas is recommended while scientists continue to strengthen the knowledge for soundscapes and the impacts of noise pollution.

Renewables energy installations are a new form of land use expanding throughout South Africa. Crucial for the just energy transition and supporting the reduction in reliance on fossil fuels, these developments present novel pressures on biodiversity and ecosystems and innovative mitigation initiatives are being implemented with the industry \[**extensive references on birdlife site, choose best**\]
