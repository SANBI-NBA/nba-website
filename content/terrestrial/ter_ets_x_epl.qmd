*The intersection of ecosystem threat status and protection level reveals protected areas expansion priorities and challenges in Fynbos, Grassland and Desert Biomes.*

Close to a quarter (105/463) of terrestrial ecosystems are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered and Not Protected or Poorly Protected). Three of the six ecosystem types making up the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Biome, and 40% of Fynbos ecosystem types (50/126) fall into this category. Within the Fynbos Biome, renosterveld ecosystems are particularly highly threatened and under-protected (17/30 types), highlighting a general trend globally where fragmented lowland regions which have seen extensive habitat loss from cropland development and human settlement are rarely included in protected areas networks. Recent [biodiversity stewardship efforts](https://overbergrenosterveld.org.za/latest-renosterveld-news-37/) in the Overberg region have seen some of these ecosystems and their iconic and threatened species receive formal protection.
