*South Africa's coastal zone has exceptional biodiversity, with `r cet_n` coastal ecosystem types supporting many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. The coast also provides numerous benefits to people, including food and materials, places to relax and play, and protection from storms and large waves. This means that the coast is also exposed to a number of pressures from human activities, on which the impacts of invasive species and climate change are superimposed. As a result, only half of South Africa's coast is still in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter of the coast is severely to critically modified. Given the extent and severity of ecological degradation, `r percent_types(cet_thr_n, cet_n)`% of the coastal ecosystem types are threatened. There is good progress in protecting coastal biodiversity, with a third (`r percent_types(c_epl_n("WP"), cet_n)`%) of coastal ecosystem types meeting their targets for protection, such that they are considered Well Protected. This needs to be strengthened, however, because a quarter (`r percent_types(c_epl_n("NP"), cet_n)`%) of the coastal ecosystem types are Not Protected. There are also `r unlucky_n` ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected). Restoring, managing and conserving coastal biodiversity in South Africa are key steps towards sustainable development, securing jobs and livelihoods, alleviating poverty, and enhancing human health and wellbeing. Planning cross-realm, in support of these actions, is essential.*

## Preamble: the new format of the NBA Coast Assessment content

Previously, the content for the Coast component of the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) was compiled into a [technical report](#technicalreport). With the move to the online format of the NBA to make the content more interactive, and the analyses more transparent and more easily repeatable, there is no longer an NBA Coast Assessment technical report.

The technical information for the NBA Coast Assessment is now compiled into [publications](#publications), and the underlying [data and analysis code](#data) are made available where relevant; interested readers can find these sections at the bottom of each page. The technical content has been summarised for a broader audience on the website pages.

We prefer the publications to be cited rather than the website pages because this affords acknowledgement to the broader group of contributors to the NBA Coast Assessment content. To cite the NBA 2025 Coast Assessment as a whole, refer to the [Recommended citation] at the bottom of this page.

## Introduction

**South Africa's coast is a national asset, rich in biodiversity, history and cultures that are all woven into the fabric of our national heritage.** Despite comprising only 4% of the mainland extent, the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) includes nearly a fifth (`r percent_types(cet_n, all_et)`%, i.e., `r cet_n`) of its `r all_et` ecosystem types.

**The South African coast has exceptional biodiversity, with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth**, particularly along the national south coast. This is largely a result of the strongly contrasting conditions around the coast, driven by the warm Agulhas Current sweeping down the east coast, and cool Benguela Current up the west coast, with distinct patterns in temperature, rainfall and geology that create the physical underpinning of South Africa's coastal biological diversity [@harris2025].

**The coast also provides a wealth of benefits to the economy, society, and human health and wellbeing that sustain and enrich the lives of many South Africans** [@harris2021]. These include both tangible and intangible benefits, such as: provision of food, medicine and useful materials; coastal protection and disaster-risk reduction; water filtration, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration; tourism; job opportunities; places that support health, wellbeing, social cohesion, sports events, cultural and spiritual practices; and opportunities for learning and connecting with nature.

The coast is a relatively small area, but comprises a treasure trove of biodiversity and benefits for all South Africans to enjoy. It is no wonder that visiting South Africa's beaches is one of the most popular tourism experiences by both local and international visitors.

## Coastal ecosystem types

**There are `r cet_n` coastal ecosystem types in South Africa, comprising `r ret_n("T")` terrestrial, `r ret_n("E")` estuarine, and `r ret_n("M")` marine ecosystem types** [@harris2025]. These ecosystems range from warm, mesic tropical and subtropical types in the north-east, to cool, arid and upwelling-driven types in the west. All of these ecosystem types have influences from both the land and the sea (@fig-ecotypes).

![Ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone in South Africa. [@harris2025]](imgs/cst-ecoystems-coastmap_Jan25.png){#fig-ecotypes fig-align="center"}

**Although not currently included in the EDCZ, freshwater ecosystem types are likely to be included in future**, particularly the coastal lakes, swamp forests (freshwater forested wetlands), dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones. There are also three micro-estuary types that are within the EDCZ; however, they are not currently assessed, and thus are not included in the count of coastal ecosystem types to simplify reporting.

## Pressures on coastal biodiversity

**Coastal ecosystems in South Africa are under more cumulative pressure than the non-coastal areas** of the mainland territory, with habitat loss on land occurring twice as fast in the coastal zone.

![Mining (for diamonds, heavy-minerals, and sand) is a significant pressure in South Africa's coastal zone, causing habitat fragmentation, degradation and loss, and increasing species extinction risk. There is proportionately five times more mining in the coast than in the rest of South Africa. (© Fiona MacKay)](imgs/cst-syn-coastal-mining_Fiona-MacKay.png)

**The most intensive pressures in South Africa's coastal zone are biological resource use, mining, and coastal development**. Unsustainable harvesting (including from poaching) is driving overexploited stock status and extinction risk in some species. Serial mining along the west coast and illegal mining are notable causes of concern, and are also key drivers of species extinction risk. Coastal development removes natural habitat and causes coastal squeeze as sea levels rise.

**Reduced freshwater flow through estuaries impacts estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems** as far offshore as the shelf edge in some places, with knock-on effects for coastal tourism, human health, and food and job security. Related to this is reduce sand delivery to the coast through rivers and estuaries. Between this and poor management of mobile dunefields, many beaches are sand-starved and in a state of erosion.

**Ports and harbours** **are key drivers of cumulative coastal impacts** **and ecological degradation** by providing points of access to the sea, leading to burgeoning development, changing local shoreline orientation, and being pressure hotspots. Other transport and service corridors (roads, railway lines, shipping) also impact coastal ecosystems by replacing natural habitat, disrupting land-sea connectivity, and increasing pollution and the risk of invasive alien species.

**Many forms of pollution are impacting coastal biodiversity cross-realm**, including chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals), sewage, plastics, light, noise, and dumped obsolete ammunition, but many of these pollutants are understudied and poorly understood, especially at a national scale. Deteriorating water quality from wastewater discharge, urban runoff, and agricultural runoff is a key issue in the coastal zone, particularly in retentive systems like estuaries and bays.

**Both invasive species and climate change are exacerbating pressures to coastal biodiversity** by changing natural ecological processes and reducing resilience of indigenous species. Some of the most important climate change impacts for coastal systems are sea-level rise, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms and floods, changes in rainfall and runoff, and temperature change, particularly temperature extremes in the form of heatwaves, and thermal shock when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling.

## Ecosystem assessments

### Ecological condition

**Given the intensity and number of pressures to coastal biodiversity, half (48%) of the South African coast is no longer in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified** (@fig-condmap, @fig-condgraph). Proportionately, there more than double the amount of modified habitat in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas. [Read more »](./cst_pressures-condition.qmd#cst-cond)

### Ecosystem threat status

**The criteria in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems were applied to determine ecosystem threat status** for the terrestrial, estuarine and marine assessments, with the results summarised here for the coastal ecosystem types. Ecosystem types were assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable (collectively referred to as threatened), Near Threatened, or Least Concern.

**There are `r cet_thr_n` (`r  percent_types(cet_thr_n, cet_n)`%) threatened coastal ecosystem types that comprise `r percent_extent(ets, "thr", "coast")`% of the coastal extent**, compared to `r ncet_thr_n` (`r  percent_types(ncet_thr_n, ncet_n)`%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise `r round(nc_thr_e/nc_e*100)`% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea). Proportionately, this means the coast has `r astext(c_nc_prop_thr_n)` times the number of threatened ecosystem types and almost an order of magnitude (`r astext(c_nc_prop_thr_e)` times) more threatened area than the rest of the South African mainland territory (@fig-etsmap, @fig-etsgraph).

     SAVE=NULL)

ggarrange(ets_t, ets_e, ncol = 2, labels = c("A","B"), common.legend = T, legend = "bottom")
```

These results are not comparable with the results from the NBA 2018 given the different assessment methodologies between the two assessments. However, improvements in data and methods have shown a more threatened status of the coast compared with that reported in 2018.

### Ecosystem protection level

**Ecosystem protection level was determined by calculating the proportion of each ecosystem type in a protected area, and evaluating these against a predefined biodiversity target per ecosystem type, with heuristics regarding the ecological condition of the ecosystem types under protection.** Ecosystem types are assigned one of four categories of protection: Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP).

**There is good progress in representing coastal ecosystem types in protected areas**, with `r percent_types(c_prot_n, cet_n)`% of 190 coastal ecosystem types now having some level of protection. However, only `r percent_types(c_epl_n("WP"), cet_n)`% of coastal ecosystem types are Well Protected, covering just `r percent_extent(epl, "WP", "coast")`% of the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ), meaning `r 100-percent_types(c_epl_n("WP"), cet_n)`% of coastal ecosystem types covering `r 100-percent_extent(epl, "WP", "coast")`% of the EDCZ are not yet meeting their biodiversity targets for protection (@fig-eplmap, @fig-eplgraph).

     SAVE=NULL)


ggarrange(epl_t, epl_e, ncol = 2, labels = c("A","B"), common.legend = T, legend = "bottom")
```

These results are also not comparable with those from the NBA 2018 because of changes in biodiversity targets and assessment methodologies.

### Coastal ecosystem types at highest risk of loss

**The ecosystem types that are at highest risk of loss can be identified by intersecting the results of the ecosystem threat status and protection level analyses**, and sub-setting the results to the most threatened and most under-protected ecosystem types (@tbl-ets_epl). <!--# include this as a dataset for download? -->

```{r}

Of the `r cet_thr_n` (of `r cet_n`) threatened coastal ecosystem types (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable), `r risky_n` (`r percent_types(risky_n, cet_thr_n)`%) are under-protected (Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected, Not Protected). `r Astext(unlucky_n)` of these are high risk, because they are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered and Poorly Protected or Not Protected) @fig-unlucky.

To see which specific ecosystem types are highly threatened and under-protected, filter @tbl-ets_epl to the categories indicated in @fig-unlucky.

## Species assessments

**Species assessments are included in the Coast Assessment for the first time.** As a first step, the threat status of 20 sandy beach invertebrates was assessed, with 1 in 5 species assessed as Endangered. A further 3 species were assessed as Near Threatened (@fig-sts).

![Threat status for 20 sandy beach invertebrate species.](imgs/cst_sts-graph.png){#fig-sts}

The Endangered coastal species are all endemic, and are impacted primarily by mining, wrack harvesting, coastal development and artificial light at night (*Tylos granulatus, Tylos capensis, Acanthoscelis ruficornis*), and over-harvesting, mining, and harmful algal blooms (*Donax serra*).

## Knowledge gaps and research priorities

**Nineteen knowledge gaps have been identified as research priorities** to strengthen further coastal biodiversity foundational knowledge and understanding of impacts to coastal biodiversity to improve assessment, and also to better understand the benefits of biodiversity and the best ways of communicating the these in a way that most inspires South Africans into action for change towards long-term sustainability. These 19 knowledge gap–research priority clusters are grouped under four themes.

## Way forward

**Restoring, managing and conserving coastal biodiversity in South Africa are key steps towards sustainable development, securing jobs and livelihoods, alleviating poverty, and enhancing human health and wellbeing.** These actions also align well with the [United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/){target="_blank"} and [Targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets){target="_blank"}.

**Now more than ever, South Africa is poised to secure key coastal biodiversity and ecological infrastructure**: half the coast is in natural to near-natural ecological condition, and the integrated map of ecosystem types[@harris2025b; @harris2019] and results from this assessment pave the way for better biodiversity planning, management and decision-making in the coastal zone.

**Cross-realm planning is essential to ensure that land-sea ecological processes and species distributions are adequately accounted for** in land-based and marine Spatial Biodiversity Plans (Maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas - CBA Maps, and associated land and sea-use guidelines). These Spatial Biodiversity Plans are a key tool by which to align governance, planning and decision-making across realms and across organs of state to achieve effective, science-based and proactive integrated coastal zone management [@harris2025a].
