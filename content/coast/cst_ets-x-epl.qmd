## Coastal ecosystem types at highest risk of loss

Intersecting the results from the ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments identifies the ecosystem types that are threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable) and under-protected (Not Protected, Poorly Protected and Moderately Protected). Within this group, the ecosystem types that are are highest risk of loss are those that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected).

There are `r risky_n` threatened coastal ecosystem types that are under-protected in South Africa (@tbl-riskies). This means that all but `r cet_thr_n-risky_n` of the `r cet_thr_n` threatened coastal ecosystem types are currently under-protected.

  thr_name <- ets_x_epl[[var]][i]
  if (!is.na(thr_name) && thr_name %in% names(threat_color_mapping)) {
    tbl_final <- tbl_final %>% row_spec(i, background = threat_color_mapping[thr_name])
  }

Of these `r risky_n` ecosystem types, `r unlucky_n` are at the greatest risk of being lost because they are highly threatened and under-protected. These include `r r_unlucky_n("T")` terrestrial, `r r_unlucky_n("E")` estuarine and `r r_unlucky_n("M")` marine ecosystem types (@tbl-riskies, @tbl-highrisklist) that urgently need improved conservation and management if their associated biodiversity and benefits are to be safeguarded into the future.

The highly threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are found all along the national coast, particularly around the Orange River mouth, in the Western Cape, between St Francis and Gqeberha, and in southern and central KwaZulu-Natal (@fig-unlucky).
