## Summary {#summary}

**South Africa arguably has one of the most diverse and scenic coasts in the world, supporting a wealth of unique biodiversity. Altogether, there are `r cet_n` coastal ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ). These include `r ret_n("T")` vegetation types, `r ret_n("E")` estuarine ecosystem types, and `r ret_n("M")` marine ecosystem types. Freshwater ecosystem types are not currently included in the EDCZ, but there is planned inclusion in future.**

## Defining and delineating the ecologically determined coastal zone

Unlike the terrestrial, inland aquatic, estuarine and marine assessments, all of which assess ecosystem types per realm, the coast assessment is undertaken in a cross-realm zone. The reason for focusing on the coast specifically is because the majority of the world's population lives in this zone [@cosby2024], concentrating pressures on biodiversity<!--# insert link to coast pressures paper when available -->. Unless assessed separately, trends in coastal biodiversity relative to the rest of the land and sea are lost in the individual realm assessments.

There are lots of different definitions and boundaries of coastal zones. For purposes like biodiversity assessments, the extent of the coast needs to comprise whole ecosystem types because that is the unit of assessment. Using whole ecosystem types also means that the results from the separate realm assessments can be extracted and summarized for the coast.

Substantial effort went into delineating an ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) for the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018 by seamlessly aligning the separate realm ecosystem maps, and tagging relevant ecosystem types in the terrestrial, estuarine and marine realm as 'coastal' based on a set of criteria [@harris2019]. The premise underpinning these criteria is that ecosystem types are considered coastal if they have a direct influence from both the land and sea:

-   **Terrestrial ecosystem types:** all vegetation types influenced by the sea, including:

    -   Coastal Vegetation – vegetation types with purely coastal descriptions, and/or with\>95% of their extent within 2.5 km of the seashore

    -   Semi-Coastal Vegetation – vegetation types with coastal affinities mentioned in description, and/or with\>70% of their extent within 10 km of the seashore

-   **Estuarine ecosystem types:** all estuary and micro-estuary types are included in the EDCZ

-   **Marine ecosystem types:** all marine ecosystem types influenced by land are coastal, including:

    -   All ecosystem types between the shore and the fair-weather wave base (depth at which ocean waves start to interact with the sea floor)

    -   All river-influenced marine ecosystem types

This criteria-based approach means that as ecosystem maps update per realm, the changes are incorporated in updates of the EDCZ.

## South Africa's coastal ecosystem types

The cool Benguela and warm Agulhas currents that flow around South Africa drive steep gradients in climate and environmental conditions from west to east, resulting in diverse coastal ecosystem types and associated species, many of which are found no where else on earth [@harris2025]. The west coast is cool and arid, and the east coast is warm and wet, with a moderate south coast between them. The biogeography around the South African coast thus ranges from cool temperate in the west, through warm temperate in the south, to subtopical and tropical in the east.

The EDCZ has been updated for the NBA 2025 based on updates to the respective realm maps, and currently comprises `r cet_n` ecosystem types [@harris2025] (@fig-edczmap):

-   **`r ret_n("T")` vegetation types**: dunes and seashore vegetation, strandveld, duneveld, dune thicket, and coastal thicket, forests and fynbos

-   **`r ret_n("E")` estuary ecosystem types**: predominantly open, temporarily closed, and fluvially dominated estuaries, and estuarine lakes, bays and lagoon

-   **`r ret_n("M")` marine ecosystem types**: sandy beaches, shingle shores and boulder shores, mixed shores, rocky shores, microbialites, islands, reefs, kelp forests, bays, hard and soft inner shelf, and river-influenced ecosystem types

![South Africa's ecologically determined coastal zone comprises `r cet_n` ecosystem types from the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realms that all support a rich diversity of species, many of which are endemic to South Africa.](imgs/cst-ecoystems-coastmap_Jan25.png){#fig-edczmap fig-align="center"}

Technically, there are an additional three microestuary ecosystem types that are also included in the EDCZ [@harris2025]. However, because microestuaries are not assessed in the National Biodiversity Assessments, they are excluded from the count of coastal ecosystem types in the NBA 2025 content to simplify the statistics and reporting.

Although there is not yet enough information to systematically identify inland aquatic ecosystem types as coastal and non-coastal, this is an area of work that needs more research. There is planned inclusion of freshwater types in future (e.g., freshwater forested wetlands, dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones).

The coastal ecosystem types are listed below (@tbl-edcztypes). For a descriptive overview of these ecosystem types, and inland aquatic ecosystem types proposed to be included in future, refer to the [publication].
