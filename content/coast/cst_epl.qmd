## Introduction

Ecosystem protection level (EPL) is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. This indicator measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in South Africa's protected area network, and has been used as in national reporting since 2005.

After comparing the extent extent of each ecosystem type under protection relative to its predefined biodiversity target (ranging 16-32%), with heuristics regarding the ecological condition within protected areas, ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories:

-   **Well Protected (WP)**: the extent target for the ecosystem type is met or exceeded within the protected area network

-   **Moderately Protected (MP):** 50 - 99% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network

-   **Poorly Protected (PP)**: 5 - 49% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network

-   **Not Protected (NP)**: \<5% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network

For NBA 2025, the EPL indicator was calculated across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on EPL, see the [general introduction](../integrated-findings/chl_epl_explained.qmd){target="_blank"} to this headline indicator.

## Coastal Ecosystem Protection Level

Proportionately, the coast is slightly more protected than the rest of the land and sea (@fig-eplgraph, @tbl-eplnumbers). This is positive given the myriad of benefits provided by coastal ecosystems and their [disproportionately impacted](../coast/cst_pressures-condition.qmd) and [threatened](../coast/cst_ets.qmd) status.

Although `r percent_types(c_prot_n, cet_n)`% of coastal ecosystem types have some level of protection (`r c_prot_n` of `r cet_n` types), only `r percent_types(c_epl_n("WP"), cet_n)`% are Well Protected, which accounts for `r percent_extent(epl, "WP", "coast")`% of the coastal extent (@fig-eplgraph, @tbl-eplnumbers).

There is good progress in protecting coastal ecosystem types, but the national protected area network does need to be strengthened to afford protection to most of the coastal zone that is currently Poorly Protected or Not Protected (`r percent_types((c_epl_n("PP")+c_epl_n("NP")), cet_n)`% of types and `r percent_extent(epl, "PP", "coast")+percent_extent(epl, "NP", "coast")`% of extent), especially for coastal terrestrial and estuarine ecosystem types.

Ideally, coastal ecosystem types should have cross-realm protection in contiguous land-based and marine protected areas. Good examples of cross-realm protection are: Garden Route National Park and Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area (MPA); iSimangaliso Wetland Park and MPA; De Hoop Nature Reserve and MPA; Addo Elephant National Park and MPA; and Namaqua National Park and MPA.

Coastal terrestrial ecosystem types are most Well Protected (`r percent_types(r_epl_n("T", "WP"), ret_n("T"))`% of types, and `r percent_extent(epl, "WP", "T")`% of extent); coastal marine ecosystem types have the largest percentage of ecosystem types in the top two categories, Well Protected and Moderately Protected (`r percent_types((r_epl_n("M", "WP")+r_epl_n("M", "MP")), ret_n("M"))`% of types); and estuarine ecosystem types have the highest extent of protection across Well, Moderately and Poorly Protected (`r percent_extent(epl, "prot", "E")`% of extent) (@fig-eplgraph, @tbl-eplnumbers).

In terms of Not Protected ecosystem types, the highest proportion of types is in the (coastal) terrestrial realm (`r percent_types(r_epl_n("T", "NP"), ret_n("T"))`%), and the highest proportion of extent is in the (coastal) marine realm (`r percent_extent(epl, "NP", "M")`%) (@fig-eplgraph, @tbl-eplnumbers).

Because the targets and assessment methodologies have changed in the realm assessments since the NBA 2018, the results are not comparable between the two assessments as a time series. However, the latest results do show that the South African coastal zone is less protected than was previously reported.
