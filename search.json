    "text": "Monitoring Genetic Diversity using Indicators\nGenetic diversity underpins all biological diversity, playing a key role in individual fitness (an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce), species’ ability to adapt to changing environments, and overall ecosystem resilience. The genetic diversity of many wild species has declined in recent decades and greater declines are projected through ongoing habitat loss and population size reductions. Local extinctions, reduced population sizes and disruption of genetic connectivity mean that many of the populations that exist today have insufficient genetic diversity to persist in the long term.\nCore Conservation Genetic Principles\nConservation monitoring is guided by key principles (Figure 1), which together capture genetic diversity at multiple scales:\n\nSafeguard evolutionary distinctiveness – preserves unique branches of the tree of life.\nProtect genetically distinct populations – maintains adaptive potential within species.\nEnsure populations are large enough for long-term persistence – reduces loss of diversity through genetic drift1 and inbreeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Representation of three core conservation genetic principles focused on safeguarding evolutionary distinctiveness (A & B), protecting genetically distinct populations to minimize the risk of losing evolutionary evolutionary distinctiveness and ensuring all populations are large enough to ensure their long-term persistence (C). Red lines represent deep phylogenetic branches at risk, which can be caused by either entire clades of species being threatened with extinction (e.g., pangolins; A) or by threatened species isolated on long branches of the phylogenetic tree (e.g., secretary bird, B). C: Dashed lines represent the loss of a genetically distinct amphibian population, while polygons with solid lines represent different existing populations, each differing in size with the largest being the most likely to avoid genetic erosion. A & B taken from Gumbs et al., 2023.\n\n\n\nIn line with these principles, South Africa has adopted four genetic indicators from the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which can be based on direct genetic data or on proxies (when genetic data are not available; namely the Ne 500 and PM indicators).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Proportion of populations with an effective population size greater than 500 (Ne 500 indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA headline indicator in the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a high-level, mandatory metric that captures the overall scope of Goal A and Target 4 of the GBF.\nEffective population size (Ne) represents the number of individuals in a population contributing to the gene pool. At any given time or reproductive cycle not all adults reproduce, consequently Ne is a subset of the number of individuals in a population (typically 10 to 30% of the census size). Studies have identified a threshold of Ne greater than 500 signifying a genetically stable and healthy population into the long term; while below 500, the risk of extinction increases. The Ne 500 indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no populations of a species have Ne above 500 and 1 indicating all populations exceed the 500 threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Proportion of populations maintained within species (PM indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA complementary indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework, providing additional context for in-depth analysis but is not required for reporting.\nThis indicator is based on the principle that genetic differences increase as populations are farther apart in geographic and/or environmental distance. By maintaining distinct populations, species are more able to adapt and evolve. The PM indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating all populations have been lost (species is extinct) and 1 indicating that all populations are still present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Changing status of evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species (EDGE index)\n\n\n\n\n\nA component indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a detailed metric that measures progress towards a specific target or goal within the framework.\nThis index is grounded in the understanding that genetically distinctive and threatened species would represent a significant loss to the tree of life if they are lost, making their preservation crucial. It is a tool for monitoring the changes in the conservation status of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage. For each taxonomic group that has a phylogeny, a value of 0 indicates that none of the genetically distinctive species are threatened and a value of 1 indicates that all genetically distinctive species are threatened with extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis complementary indicator is estimated as the total phylogenetic diversity in a phylogeny weighted by the probability of extinction for each species. This can be expressed as a percentage of the total phylogenetic diversity for the clade, where 100% would indicate that all species have the highest possible probability of extinction and all PD is expected to be lost, while 0% suggests that all species are safe from extinction and no PD is expected to be lost. The larger number of threatened species that contribute to high phylogenetic diversity, the more diversity is expected to be lost into the future.",

South Africa reported a PM value of 0.95 and Ne 500 value of 0.42. This indicates that, while South Africa has maintained the majority of its species’ populations, they are smaller than what is needed to ensure their long-term persistence and the overall adaptive potential of the species. While this first assessment incorporated a relatively small number of species, the species included were from a wide variety of taxonomic groups, ecosystems, distributions and conservation statuses.\nImportantly, these national metrics can be dissagregated in various ways, such as by taxonomic group (Table 1) or conservation status (Figure 2), to explore patterns and trends across different biodiversity components, similar to species and ecosystems assessments.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Tracking the Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity\n\nA Case Study on South Africa’s Amphibians and Reptiles\nSouth Africa is home to exceptionally rich and evolutionarily unique biodiversity, the loss of which would represent a significant erosion of the country’s evolutionary heritage. Using comprehensive Red List assessments together with detailed evolutionary (phylogenetic) trees, researchers can estimate how much of this evolutionary hertiage could be lost if threatened species for extinct - a metric known as Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity — the proportion of evolutionary history likely to be lost if currently threatened species go extinct.\nIn a recent case study2, this approach was applied to South Africa’s amphibians and reptiles, both of which have exceptionally high levels of endemism (around 50%). By integrating extinction risk data with measures of phylogenetic diversity (PD), researchers found that, without conservation action, about 6.5% of amphibian PD and 5% of reptile PD could be lost over the next 50 years (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The PD indicator for South African amphibians (red) and reptiles (purple), calculated at three intervals between 1990 and 2020. Values are estimated as the percentage of phylogenetic diversity (PD) expected to be lost within 50 years3. Dated national phylogenies were used along with probabilities of extinction, inferred from backcasted IUCN scores weighted according to Gumbs et al. (2023) (CR = 0.97, EN = 0.49, VU = 0.24, NT = 0.12, and LC = 0.06).\n\n\n\nImportantly, areas rich in PD did not always coincide with regions of high species richness, revealing new priorities for conservation to protect large portions of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity for South African A) amphibians and B) reptiles, generated using national phylogenies where branch lengths were weighted by the probability of all descendant species becoming extinct3. The highest risk for both groups is estimated to be found in the tropical east, while for amphibians, notable concentrations appear in montane regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. For reptiles, extreme concentrations of expected PD loss can be found in the north-east of KwaZulu-Natal and in the north-west of the Northern Cape Province.\n\n\n\nThis study provides a national framework for monitoring phylogenetic biodiversity and its expected loss, aligned with global biodiversity monitoring goals. It demonstrates an approach that can be extended to other taxonomic groups, helping ensure that conservation strategies safeguard not only species, but also the deep evolutionary lineages and adaptive potential that make South Africa’s biodiversity globally unique.",

    "text": "What are Biodiversity Biobanks?\nBiodiversity biobanks, genetic resource banks, genetic repositories or genebanks can be described as scientific collections of different types of preserved biomaterials from biological organisms including tissue, DNA, blood, cell cultures, embryos, reproductive material such as seeds, eggs and sperm, and even whole organisms. These collections are usually preserved by freezing or cold storage. Environmental samples such as water or soil are increasingly being collected and stored for analyses of the biological communities in these habitats. For any type of biobank, one of the main qualifying criteria is that the biomaterials and associated data must be preserved and managed according to rigorous scientific standards and protocols to ensure the viability and quality of the material.\nExtant and even recently extinct species across the entire tree of life can be represented in biodiversity biobanks, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protists, as well as plants and animals but materials originating from humans are usually excluded. Biodiversity biobanks can include not only indigenous, naturally occurring species, but also exotic species, and in the context of agrobiodiversity, also breeds and varieties of cultivated crops and domesticated livestock.\nBiodiversity biobanks are recognised as essential infrastructure that preserves, manages and provides biomaterials representing currently and potentially endangered, useful, and harmful organisms, for research, conservation, sustainable use and biotechnology development. Biodiversity biobanks offer valuable materials that enable comparisons across taxa, regions and time, and they help to preserve biological material from species, populations, or strains that are rare, declining, or even extinct in the wild. Recent breakthroughs in DNA and RNA sequencing such as High Throughput Sequencing, alongside innovations like DNA barcoding, metabarcoding, whole genome sequencing and metagenomics, have significantly boosted interest in accessing genetic material. If powerful tools like gene editing, cell cloning, and ex situ propagation and reproduction are also considered, it is clear why there is an increase in the demand for access to genetic material. Vouchering of biomaterials from research projects in a recognized biobank allows both verification of data and further investigation.\n\n\n\nCuration of biomaterials.",

    "text": "Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa\nThe Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa (BBSA) is a network of biobanks that make biomaterials accessible to external researchers, and that agree to work towards the implementation of common, best practice standards and policies and is coordinated by SANBI. The BBSA is funded through the Department of Science, Technology & Innovation (DSTI) but the participating institutions are responsible for funding the routine operations of the biobanks. The aim of the BBSA is to increase the range and quality of biomaterials stored and/or distributed, and increase and improve access for research, conservation and socio-economic development. The objectives include promoting the value of biodiversity biobanks; ensuring a credible, legally compliant and ethical system for collecting, storing and providing access to biomaterials by aligning with standards and procedures set by global and national initiatives and structures; strategic expansion of the biobank holdings; increasing the use and impact of the biomaterials by making inventory data accessible; facilitating training and capacity development, and participation in international networks.\nThere are currently nine institutions (four national science councils, two institutions under a national government department and three universities) participating in the BBSA, collectively with 17 biobanks predominantly focused on indigenous biodiversity and 12 biobanks for crops and livestock and their diseases. These biobanks hold a total of over two million accessions. There are several other biodiversity biobanks in South Africa that are not involved in the BBSA and that are associated with individual researchers or units, and there are likely to be vast amounts of biomaterials that have been collected for research projects that are not accessioned into a biobank collection.

This is a positive trend in that it justifies the existence of the biobank, and facilitates research that benefits biodiversity, human health and economic development. Demand must be managed through sound policies that guide decision-making for the use of samples, and recognize that there can be different categories of use depending on the sample status (threat status of species, number of replicates, embargo for current projects) and categories of users and of types of use.\nThe Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization is an international agreement adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The Nagoya Protocol requires that the relevant authority in a signatory country must give Prior Informed Consent (PIC) before genetic resources can be accessed and used, that there is a Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) agreement between the provider country and the users on the conditions of access and use of the resources and on the benefits to be shared by the two parties. Benefits can be both monetary and non-monetary, with the latter including joint research, training, and sharing of results. At a national level, the Bioprospeing, Access and Benefit Sharing Regulations (2008, amended in 2015)[@governmentofsouthafrica2015] are relevant for bioprospecting and biotrade but also the collection of samples that may have any use for type of biodiscovery or bioprospecting even if this is in future, and the export of samples from South Africa including for purely academic research. There is also legislation for Threatened and Protected Species, provincial legislation for collecting, sharing and exporting biomaterials and requirements for research involving biomaterials originating from animals or micro-organisms under the Animal Disease Control Act (1984). Microbial culture collections need to be registered with the Department of Trade and Industry in terms of the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, 1993 (Act no 87 of 1993).

For now, we are starting with IUCN Red List assessments of sandy beach invertebrates, but will expand this over time to include more coastal species, including those already assessed in the terrestrial, estuarine and marine realms. This will allow more comprehensive analyses of species to determine, for example, whether coastal species are more threatened than non-coastal species as a result of the disproportionate pressures on coastal ecosystems.",

There is evidence of population declines by 50-80% based on commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in South Africa over the past 10 years, disappearance of the species at sites that have been mined in Namibia, and anecdotal evidence of severe declines and/or disappearance of the species at certain beaches in South Africa. Harmful algal blooms can also cause mass mortalities. The overall population is suspected to have declined by over 50% in the past decade and it is therefore assessed as Endangered under Criterion A2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis (Cape calloused beach pillbug) is endemic to South Africa. It has a limited range and restricted habitat along the South African south coast, with between 9 and 12 locations extant. It is experiencing ongoing loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat to expanding coastal development and artificial light at night (ALAN), and has been lost from at least four locations, including inside protected areas. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus (granulated calloused beach pillbug) is restricted to the coast of Namibia and South Africa. It generally occurs in low numbers, and is found in large abundances (hundreds to thousands of individuals) in only a few places. Extirpations have been recorded at the southern end of its range due to coastal development, there are no recent records in the northern part of its range, and it is impacted by mining. Kelp wrack removal takes away an important source of food for this species. Collectively these pressures are causing notable declines in its habitat availability and quality, and declines in the number of mature individuals. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis (beach ground beetle) is a southern African endemic species, found only in the supralittoral habitat on sandy beaches along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. It burrows in the sand or hides under kelp wrack, feeding on invertebrates associated with wrack. Approximately 80% of its recent (since 2000) range is exposed to mining, coastal development and/or kelp wrack removal. These pressures are causing declines in habitat extent, quality, and population abundance, and there is evidence that the species has been lost from some sites that have been mined. The population is inferred to be severely fragmented, comprising small, isolated subpopulations across its range. It is therefore listed as Endangered under Criterion B.",

The coastal pressures in South Africa are summarised cross-realm under 10 themes: (1) biological resource use; (2) energy production and mining; (3) pollution; (4) coastal development; (5) transportation and service corridors; (6) natural systems modifications; (7) human intrusions and disturbance; (8) aquaculture, agriculture and plantation forestry; (9) invasive and other problematic species and diseases; and (10) climate change, severe weather, and ocean acidification. The impact of these pressures on coastal ecosystem types is analysed using realm-specific methods to generate a map of coastal ecological condition. Overall, the coast is in worse ecological condition than the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea).\n\n\n\nPressures, such as mining, are intense in the coastal zone, causing declines in the ecological condition of coastal ecosystem types and increasing species extinction risk.

As a result, human population densities are much higher closer to the shore than further inland. In fact, there are more people living within 50 km of the shore today as lived on Earth in the 1930s1. This means that the human footprint is generally much higher in the coastal zone than elsewhere.\nThe distinct geographic position of the coast at the interface between land and sea also means that it is exposed to multiple pressures from land-based, estuarine, and marine sources. In fact, of all pressures to biodiversity mapped in the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realm assessments, only four pressures are absent from the coastal zone (all of which are types of deep-sea fishing).",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal ecosystem types\nThe pressures on coastal biodiversity are briefly summarized below under the 10 categories established by the IUCN (Figure 1), with some slight terminology adjustments. Click the headings to view or hide the information per pressure category.\n\n\n1. Biological resource use\n\n\n There are many forms of biological resource use in the coastal zone, with different levels of sustainability and impact to coastal biodiversity. Photo credit: © Ryan Daly\n\nSouth Africa’s coast is rich in biological resources on land, in estuaries and in the sea that are harvested for food, medicine, symbolism, and materials. Resources such as invertebrates, fish, birds, mammals, seaweeds, and plants are collected both legally and illegally, with key concerns regarding over-harvesting, bycatch, and ghost fishing. Unsustainable resource use impacts populations of target and non-target species and their respective predators, causes changes in trophic and demographic structures of foodwebs, alters energy flow through and among ecosystems, and some collection methods cause habitat damage. Certain species are particularly impacted by poaching, e.g., abalone and succulent plants.\n\n\n\n2. Energy production and mining\n\n\nMining is a key pressure on coastal biodiversity, particularly the serial mining along the west coast. © Linda Harris\n\nSouth Africa’s mineral wealth is comparable to its outstanding biodiversity, and mining is a key economic activity in the country. In the coastal zone, sand, diamonds, and heavy minerals are mined in legal and illegal operations. Mining is an intense pressure on biodiversity with long-term impacts from habitat fragmentation and loss, and species disturbance and extirpations. It can also cause pollution, proliferation of alien and invasive species, and changes in habitat characteristics that have knock-on effects to species.\nImpacts to coastal biodiversity in South Africa from petroleum exploration and production are primarily in the marine realm, with increasing interest in offshore operations as part of national imperatives to grow the country’s blue economy. Petroleum activities can cause habitat loss, introduction of alien and invasive species, and various forms of pollution - including oil spills - that collectively cause habitat degradation; impact species communication, feeding, distributions and migrations; and increase the likelihood of ship-strikes to marine animals.\nRenewable energy is important for achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts, and supporting socio-economic growth in the country. Current operations in South Africa’s coastal zone include wind farms, with planned solar energy plants and green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia initiatives), and potential offshore wind farms. Impacts to biodiversity include habitat fragmentation and loss, species disturbance, collisions with wind turbines, and extirpations, as well as potential pollution.\n\n\n\n3. Pollution\n\n\nPollution from plastics, wastewater, artificial light at night, noise, and obsolete ammunition are degrading the ecological condition of coastal ecosystems. Photo credit: © Fiona MacKay\n\nPlastic pollution is present all along South Africa’s coastal zone, with substantial quantities washing into the coastal zone during flood events. The impact of plastics on biodiversity, especially coastal and marine biodiversity, has become very apparent in recent years and there are numerous campaigns globally to stop single-use plastics in particular, and to reduce use of plastics generally. Key concerns include: animal entanglement, which can lead to injury, suffocation or drowning; ingestion causing gut blockages; accumulation of chemicals derived from plastic ingestion in animal tissue; and potential increases in spread of alien and invasive species.\nLand-based wastewater discharge is a significant source of chemical pollution and comprises a range of effluents and polluted runoff. Wastewater enters the sea via estuaries and outfalls, polluting ground- and surface water and sediments. Areas with high levels of organic nutrients cause eutrophication, fuel red tides and harmful algal blooms, and can cause anoxia, which may lead to fish kills. There is increasing concern over the quantities of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals and hydrocarbons recorded in the coastal zone that can accumulate in foodwebs, with risks to human health.\nArtificial light at night makes naturally dark areas lighter, altering natural cycles of light and dark, and impacting species’ circadian rhythms and night-time behaviour. Impacts to coastal species have been recorded in rocky shore communities, dune vertebrates, plants, pollinators, sea turtles, and intertidal fish, and it is one of the key pressures impacting threatened beach invertebrates, e.g., the Endangered Cape pillbug, Tylos capensis.\nSound travels more readily through water, making noise pollution a particular concern in aquatic environments, especially as oceans become busier and noisier. Noise can cause direct mortality, impaired hearing, and lower immunity and increased health risks of species. It also disrupts animal communication and social behaviour, limits bird-call repertoires, impacts animal foraging behaviour and success, and alters species distributions as they avoid noisier areas.\nDisposing ammunition, such as artillery shells, and expired, unusable or obselete ammunition, at sea was practiced in South Africa from the 1970s until 1995. There are several concerns for marine biodiversity: corrosion of munitions and resulting pollution and toxicity (especially from heavy metals like lead and mercury) in the surrounding environment; potential detonation, causing localised destruction; and changes to the physical environment and potential damage or smothering of natural ecosystems due to presence of foreign structures and/or damage to habitat-forming species.\n\n\n\n4. Coastal development\n\n\nCoastal development is a significant pressure on coastal biodiversity, causing habitat fragmentation and loss. © Linda Harris\n\nCoastal development is one of the most important pressures on coastal biodiversity because it causes largely irreversible habitat fragmentation and loss, with associated impacts to species distributions and population abundance, increasing extinction risk. Ecosystems are degraded further when ecological processes are disrupted, and ecological infrastructure and ecological resilience are compromised, in turn reducing ecosytem services and benefits to people. When infrastructure is built too close to the shore, beaches are at risk of complete inundation and loss as sea levels rise, with no option for them to naturally realign further inland. Broadly speaking, the areas in South Africa associated with ports and harbours are most intensively developed.\n\n\n\n5. Transportation and service corridors\n\n\nPorts and harbours are sources of multiple pressures on coastal ecosystems, and transport corridors disrupt cross-realm connectivity and ecological processes. Photo credit: © Riaan Weitz\n\nPorts and harbours are hubs of activity, development, and access to the sea. The impacts to biodiversity from associated activities include being hotspots of pollution, and high-risk entry points and refugia for alien and invasive species, with local habitat modification and degradation from anchorage, maintenance dredging and dredge spoil dumping. Offshore bunkering (ship-to-ship transfer of fuel) can have deleterious impacts to marine life, especially threatened colonial seabirds, e.g., African Penguins and Cape Gannets.\nSouth Africa is a hub of shipping activity, with eight commercial ports that receive international trade. The main biodiversity impacts associated with shipping are: impacts from oil spills during shipping accidents; underwater noise; ship strikes with large marine animals; introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling; and various forms of pollution, including when ships lose their cargo at sea.\nMany roads and railway lines that run along South Africa’s coastline break connectivity of ecological processes across the land-sea interface, and in some places, are very precariously positioned and are at risk of damage and collapse in the face of heavy swell and floods. Roads and railway lines also run over estuaries on bridges, which changes sediment flow downstream, and can cause mouth closure and lead to eutrophication. Connectivity of terrestrial species through their distributions is also impacts by linear infrastructure, with many species being injured or killed by moving vehicles.\n\n\n\n6. Natural systems modifications\n\n\nAltering natural flows of freshwater and sediments, e.g., the weir in the uThukela River, impacts estuarine systems and downstream beaches and marine mud belts. © Fiona MacKay\n\nInterruption of sand-flow processes impacts sand budgets that maintain beaches and dunes. Sand is transported to and along the coast by rivers and estuaries, wind (including through wind-driven mobile dunefields), and by waves and inshore currents. The dune-beach-surf zone within which sand moves is called the littoral active zone, where erosion (sand removal) and accretion (sand build up) are natural processes. Blocking these flows by stabilising sand dunes, replacing foredunes with coastal development, and contructing dams and weirs in estuaries reduces the amount of sand available to beaches and dunes, decreasing their resilience to large storms and sea-level rise.\nHealthy functioning rivers deliver freshwater, nutrients and sediments to estuaries and the ocean, and sand to beaches and dunes. Hydrological regime change and freshwater flow reduction in estuaries from water abstraction, large impoundments and small farm dams impacts both estuarine ecosystems and downstream marine ecosystems. Without sufficient flow, water quality declines, salinity regimes are compromised, and sediment accumulates in estuary mouths, often increasing the risk of coastal flooding. Estuarine connectivity, and fish nursery functions are also compromised, with knock-on effects for marine fisheries. Trapping sediment in catchments also cuts off sand and mud supplies to downstream beaches and marine mud belts, respectively. Artificial breaching also alters natural hydrological regimes in estuaries, and can have potentially cascading impacts on the physico-chemistry of the estuary and its biological components.\nAlthough coastal rangelands are generally a biodiversity-compatible land use, under some circumstances they can pose risks to coastal ecosystems. Livestock grazing and browsing and associated trampling can contribute to dune destabilisation, and to increased susceptibility to erosion of dunes and estuarine banks. Livestock grazing and browsing can also stunt the growth of mangrove trees and reduce biomass of salt marsh, reducing blue carbon in estuarine systems.\n\n\n\n7. Human intrusions and disturbance\n\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities in the seashore zone that cause erosion and lethal and non-lethal impacts to species. © Linda Harris\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities, such as trampling, off-road vehicle (ORV) driving, in-water recreation, and boating in estuaries and the sea. Biota can get crushed, injured, or disturbed, and shorebirds can be disturbed during breeding and foraging. Trampling in dunes also risks erosion and formation of blowouts. Virtually the entire South African shoreline is accessible by foot, and is thus potentially vulnerable to human disturbance in some form.\n\n\n\n8. Aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry\n\n\nThere is disproportionately more aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry in the coastal zone than in the rest of the land and sea, causing a variety of impacts to coastal biodiversity. © Daniel Lemley\n\nAlong the South African coast, mariculture operations take the form of in-situ aquatic operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages, and land-based aquaculture operations abstract sea water, pass it through a culture facility, and then return it to the marine environment. One of the main biodiversity concerns associated with aquaculture is introduction of alien and potentially invasive species to the natural environment. Other concerns include transfer of disease and pathogens to local populations; potential for emergence of superbugs due to the use of antibiotics; genetic exchange between farmed and wild populations; and changed behaviour of apex predators around installations.\nAgricultural practices vary in terms of their impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Cultivation of croplands requires clearing natural habitats, resulting in habitat loss, and contaminated agricultural return flow can pollute estuarine and marine systems, causing eutrophication. Abandoned croplands may be impacted further by unsustainable livestock grazing and alien invasive species in fallow areas.\nCommercial afforestation threatens a host of coastal species through fragmentation and loss of indigenous vegetation. The concentration of a large numbers of trees can also change the local hydrology, lowering the water table and impacting streams, wetlands and indigenous plants. Plantation canopies cause shading, soil acidification and aridification, and can alter understory growth and nutrient availability to indigenous biota.\n\n\n\n9. Invasive and other problematic species and diseases\n\n\nIndigenous species are being impacted by invasive alien species, e.g., deliberately introduced species to stabilise dunes, and unintentionally introduced species from shipping, and other problematic species and diseases. © Linda Harris\n\nInvasive alien species are an established pressure on land, but an emerging pressure in estuaries and the sea. Many of the terrestrial invasive alien species in coastal areas are present because of deliberate introductions, e.g., to stabilize mobile dunes at a time when this was considered to be best practice. In contrast, introduction of invasive alien species to the estuarine and marine realms has been generally unintentional, e.g. through hull fouling and ballast water. Invasive alien species can change community composition and local ecological processes, with direct and indirect effects on indigenous species. Invasive alien species can also contribute to wildfires and alter natural fire regimes, reduce mean annual runoff, and can reduce light, oxygen and flow in estuaries, with knock-on affects to biodiversity.\nThe frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in South Africa’s coastal zone, largely due to increased nutrient loading from municipal wastewater, urban stormwater, and agricultural runoff. HABs impact estuarine and coastal marine systems by causing hypoxia, impacting biodiversity and causing mass mortalities, with potential risks to human health as well.\nSeveral other pathogens and diseases are impacting coastal species, including High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza in seabirds, rabies in seals, and a water mold (Aphanomyces invadans) that causes epizootic ulcerative syndrome in fish that is now found in almost all estuaries in South Africa.\n\n\n\n10. Climate change, severe weather, and ocean acidification\n\n\nClimate change is predicted to impact coastal ecosystems and species in a variety of ways, such as marine heatwaves causing coral bleaching. © Kerry Sink\n\nWhere coasts are unconstrained, sea-level rise does not pose a risk to coastal biodiversity because the shore will naturally realign further inland. However, where the coast has been built up with development within the littoral active zone, particularly where it is defended with seawalls, the consequence is that the shores are trapped in a coastal squeeze, with long-term risks of infrastructure failure as well. Supralittoral and high shore species are most at risk of loss, including loss of nesting and foraging habitat for shorebirds. Sea-level rise will affect saline penetration and mouth state in estuaries, altering estuarine ecology, and mangroves and salt marsh habitats may be impacted too.\nClimate-change predictions for South Africa include altered rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme events, such as droughts, storms and floods. The South African east coast is predicted to get wetter, particularly from heavy rainfall events and floods, and the west coast is predicted to get drier, where recent droughts attributed to climate change have increased the extinction risk to endemic plants. Increased storminess increases coastal erosion, and can impact estuarine ecology. Although coastal ecosystems are generally able to return to pre-storm conditions, this is dependent on the frequency of events.\nCoastal species are shiting their ranges in response to temperature change. This could lead to various changes in communities as biological interactions change, and pioneer species may trigger ecological successions. Coastal endemic species along the south coast may also experience a temperature squeeze between the Cool Temperate and Subtropical bioregions. Other impacts include increased likelihood and spread of wildfires, dried up water holes, and altered animal behaviour.\nExtreme temperatures may have more significant impacts than overall trends in warming and cooling. Heatwaves can cause mortality in indigenous plants and favour spead of invasives, and marine heatwaves can cause coral bleaching. Thermal shock to fish and invertebrates in the marine environment may be exacerbated when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling events, causing washouts and mortalities.\nSouth African waters are more susceptible to impacts from ocean acidification because of the biochemistry of upwelled water, making systems like the Benguela naturally more acidic (lower pH). However, macroalgal habitats are less acidic (higher pH) than their surrounding environment, and may act as refugia for coastal species. Ocean pH levels are variable around South Africa in both space and time. Natural fluctuations in ocean acidity may either help create resilience in coastal species, or combine with gradual trends to produce more extreme conditions and impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of each of these pressures, refer to the published review on cross-realm pressures on coastal biodiversity in South Africa.",

    "text": "Ecological condition of coastal ecosystem types\n\nMapping ecological condition essentially gives a spatial representation of the overall effect of various pressures on biodiversity, and is one of the input datasets for calculating ecosystem threat status. Ecological condition is estimated using different approaches in the separate realms: in the terrestrial assessment it relies primarily on land-cover change; in the estuarine assessment, a multi-criteria framework is used; and in the marine assessment, cumulative pressure mapping is used. For details on the realm-specific methods, see the Ecological condition across realms section of the integrated findings and the individual realm pages on ecological condition (terrestrial, estuaries, marine).\nAlthough different methods for calculating ecological condition were used in the separate realm assessments, they were aligned as far as possible to allow for cross-realm comparisons and unified terminology. Ultimately, these are presented in the coastal assessment in four  simplified categories (that link to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories): natural/near-natural; moderately modified; heavily modified; and critically modified. Importantly, severely modified habitat is included differently among realms. For terrestrial and marine habitat, severely modified areas are included with heavily modified, and for estuarine habitat, severely modified areas are included with critically modified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Categories of ecological condition, summarised across realms. \n\n\n\nThe ecological condition of all coastal ecosystem types was extracted from the three realms and compiled into a single map, revealing that half (48%) of the South African coast is in a modified state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified (Figure 4, Figure 5). There is also more than double the amount of natural habitat that has been modified in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas (Figure 5). Broadly speaking, the places with the highest population density are associated with coastal areas in the most heavily to critically modified ecological condition. These include the southwestern Cape, southeastern Cape, and most of KwaZulu-Natal. Importantly, these areas are all associated with ports and harbours, and their related burgeoning development in the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Altogether, there are 190 coastal ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ). These include 83 vegetation types, 22 estuarine ecosystem types, and 85 marine ecosystem types. Freshwater ecosystem types are not currently included in the EDCZ, but there is planned inclusion in future.\n\n\n\nThe ecological determined coastal zone is a cross-realm zone that includes terrestrial, estuarine and marine ecosystem types, as illustrated here at Nature’s Valley.

    "text": "Defining and delineating the ecologically determined coastal zone\nUnlike the terrestrial, inland aquatic, estuarine and marine assessments, all of which assess ecosystem types per realm, the coast assessment is undertaken in a cross-realm zone. The reason for focusing on the coast specifically is because the majority of the world’s population lives in this zone1, concentrating pressures on biodiversity. Unless assessed separately, trends in coastal biodiversity relative to the rest of the land and sea are lost in the individual realm assessments.\nThere are lots of different definitions and boundaries of coastal zones. For purposes like biodiversity assessments, the extent of the coast needs to comprise whole ecosystem types because that is the unit of assessment. Using whole ecosystem types also means that the results from the separate realm assessments can be extracted and summarized for the coast.\nSubstantial effort went into delineating an ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) for the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018 by seamlessly aligning the separate realm ecosystem maps, and tagging relevant ecosystem types in the terrestrial, estuarine and marine realm as ‘coastal’ based on a set of criteria2. The premise underpinning these criteria is that ecosystem types are considered coastal if they have a direct influence from both the land and sea:\n\nTerrestrial ecosystem types: all vegetation types influenced by the sea, including:\n\nCoastal Vegetation – vegetation types with purely coastal descriptions, and/or with&gt;95% of their extent within 2.5 km of the seashore\nSemi-Coastal Vegetation – vegetation types with coastal affinities mentioned in description, and/or with&gt;70% of their extent within 10 km of the seashore\n\nEstuarine ecosystem types: all estuary and micro-estuary types are included in the EDCZ\nMarine ecosystem types: all marine ecosystem types influenced by land are coastal, including:\n\nAll ecosystem types between the shore and the fair-weather wave base (depth at which ocean waves start to interact with the sea floor)\nAll river-influenced marine ecosystem types\n\n\nThis criteria-based approach means that as ecosystem maps update per realm, the changes are incorporated in updates of the EDCZ.",

    "text": "South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types\nThe cool Benguela and warm Agulhas currents that flow around South Africa drive steep gradients in climate and environmental conditions from west to east, resulting in diverse coastal ecosystem types and associated species, many of which are found no where else on earth3. The west coast is cool and arid, and the east coast is warm and wet, with a moderate south coast between them. The biogeography around the South African coast thus ranges from cool temperate in the west, through warm temperate in the south, to subtopical and tropical in the east.\nThe EDCZ has been updated for the NBA 2025 based on updates to the respective realm maps, and currently comprises 190 ecosystem types3 (Figure 1):\n\n83 vegetation types: dunes and seashore vegetation, strandveld, duneveld, dune thicket, and coastal thicket, forests and fynbos\n22 estuary ecosystem types: predominantly open, temporarily closed, and fluvially dominated estuaries, and estuarine lakes, bays and lagoon\n85 marine ecosystem types: sandy beaches, shingle shores and boulder shores, mixed shores, rocky shores, microbialites, islands, reefs, kelp forests, bays, hard and soft inner shelf, and river-influenced ecosystem types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. South Africa’s ecologically determined coastal zone comprises 190 ecosystem types from the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realms that all support a rich diversity of species, many of which are endemic to South Africa.\n\n\n\nTechnically, there are an additional three microestuary ecosystem types that are also included in the EDCZ3. However, because microestuaries are not assessed in the National Biodiversity Assessments, they are excluded from the count of coastal ecosystem types in the NBA 2025 content to simplify the statistics and reporting.\nAlthough there is not yet enough information to systematically identify inland aquatic ecosystem types as coastal and non-coastal, this is an area of work that needs more research. There is planned inclusion of freshwater types in future (e.g., freshwater forested wetlands, dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones).\nThe coastal ecosystem types are listed below (Table 1). For a descriptive overview of these ecosystem types, and inland aquatic ecosystem types proposed to be included in future, refer to the publication.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This represents a high diversity of estuary types stemming from the country’s diverse climatic, oceanographic and geological drivers. Four biogeographical regions characterise the South African coast; namely the Cool Temperate (Orange to Ratel), the Warm Temperate (Heuningnes to Mendwana), the Subtropical (Mbashe to St Lucia) and the Tropical (uMgobezeleni to Kosi) (Emanuel et al. 1992; Harrison 2002; Turpie et al. 2000). Rainfall in these regions varies significantly from less than 100 mm along the arid west coast to about 1 200 mm along the east coast.\n\n\n\nKnysna Estuarine Bay @ Duran de villiers\n\n\nIn South Africa, there are circa 176 estuarine-associated plant species, the majority (56 species) of which are associated with salt marsh habitat. Key estuary habitats in South Africa cover a total area of 103 500 ha, with reeds and sedges (17 500 ha) overall the dominant habitat type. On a bioregional scale, supratidal salt marsh dominates in the Cool temperate region (6 300 ha) and Warm temperate region (2 400 ha, reeds and sedges in the Subtropical region (10 800 ha), and swamp forest in the Tropical region (2 000 ha). Estuaries with the largest extent are St Lucia (44 800 ha), Groot Berg (8 000 ha) and Knysna (2 400 ha). The number of macrophyte species per estuary varied from 1 to 54 (recorded at Kosi). Macrophyte species richness in estuaries of the Cool and Warm Temperate region is higher than that in the Subtropical and Tropical region. Macrophyte species are distributed amongst 58 families . Only 66 plant species occurred in five or more estuaries in the country.\nApproximately 50 of the 150 estuarine-associated fish species that regularly occur in estuaries are Southern African endemics of which 20 are exclusively found in South African waters with some species confined to only a few systems. For example, the iconic Knysna seahorse only occurs in three estuaries (Knysna, Swartvlei, Keurbooms), the Bot River Klipvis in two estuaries (Bot/Kleinmond and Klein) and the Estuarine Pipefish in five estuaries (historically Bushmans, Kariega, Kasouga, East and West Kleinemonde but only confirmed extant in two of these systems).\nThe importance of South Africa’s estuaries for resident and migratory waterbirds has long been recognised. A total of 35 bird species are considered highly dependent on estuaries as more than 15% of their regional population is found in these systems. The 118 waterbird species found in South African estuaries belong to eight orders, 25 families and 73 genera.

Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.\nOverall, Cool Temperate and Subtropical ecosystems are at higher risk of ecosystem collapse, and the most threatened ecosystem functional groups are Estuarine bays, Estuarine lakes, Large fluvially dominated, Large temporarily closed, and Arid predominantly closed systems. Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk.\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types now have some representation in the protected areas network, but only 1% are Well Protected (link to KMB4). Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves, and open oceans are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s estuarine protected area estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. Importantly, however, the ecological condition of estuaries in protected areas also needs improvement (link to KMC2) for ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status. Estuarine conservation also needs to better consider and involve people (link to KMC1), diversify protection models, and address issues that undermine legitimacy.\nIn the estuarine realm, 17% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the Cool Temperate and KwaZulu-Natal.",

Concerning overall, more than 70% of estuarine area is significantly modified.\nThis represent an overall 1% decline in Natural/Near Natural estuaries and 7% increase in degraded extent. Important ecological processes are under severe pressure and with resultant reductions in ecosystem productivity, food security, fisheries livelihood, property values and recreational enjoyment.\nEstuaries require increased protection and interventions across multiple sectors to arrest the ongoing decline. Key concerns are escalating gillnetting pressure, declining water quality, increased flow reduction, and land-use change in the estuarine functional zone (mining & farming).\n\nADD BUBBLE MAP OF CONDITION\n\n\nThere are many interacting pressures cumulatively affecting estuarine ecosystems and species.

Wastewater discharges amount to about 655 000 m3/d (32% of estuaries under severe pollution pressure), with harmful algal blooms (HABs) now recorded in 18% of estuaries in response to declining water quality. Estuaries, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and Wild Coast, are under severe pressure from illegal gillnetting, with systems under severe pressure increasing from 15% to 21% to 28% between 2011, 2018 and 2025 (75%, 78% and 85% of area), significantly compromising the multiple benefits derived from estuaries. Over 22% of estuaries are also subjected to severe habitat modification.\nOverall multiple interventions are required to avoid further decline in health. These include protection of freshwater inflow to estuaries and the sea, restoration of water quality, reduction in fishing effort and avoidance of mining, infrastructure development and crops in the estuarine functional zone.\n\nADD BUBBLE MAP OF PRESSURE\n\n\nThe impacts of cumulative pressures also warrant consideration at multiple scales, particularly in evaluating the impacts of expanding and diversifying ocean economy activities. Failure to account for indirect and cumulative impacts will mean that potential impacts are missed and poor spatial planning and decisions are likely, with negative impacts on people and the environment (link to KMA2). 108\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s estuaries.

While this finding corresponds well with the ecosystem assessment where a high proportion of ecosystems are highly threatened, it is based on a limited set of species assessments that include a high proportion of range restricted endemics, economically important species or habitat forming species. Of the groups considered, only birds were comprehensively assessed. Future assessments need to include all representatives of a taxonomic group to remedy this bias.\nIncreased extinction risk for estuarine species is attributed to multiple pressures, with overfishing (including by recreational, small-scale, commercial and illegal fisheries), pollution, flow reduction, biological invasions, coastal development, agriculture and mining contributing most to the threatened status of estuarine species.",

    "text": "Responses\nSouth Africa has a strong policy and legislative framework to protect and manage estuaries. Excellent progress has been made in the management of estuaries in water and land use/planning sector. DWS has determined the ecological water requirements of all estuaries, with 100% of these being subject to the “Classification” of freshwater resources. In addition, about 20% of estuaries have Estuary Management Plans in various stages of completion under the guidance of DFFE, provinces and conservation agencies. These noteworthy progresses since 2018 play a critical role in ensuring estuary health and the multiple benefits that society derives from them.\nThe above measures are proactive in that they set management objectives for estuarine resources on the strategic level through the engagement of society in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, there has been a deterioration in the management of extractive use in estuaries, with sand, mineral and diamond mining key concerns.\nThere is an urgent need to strengthen bilateral arrangements between sectors dealing with Environment, Water, Fishing & Mining to ensure optimum resource allocation. In many of the above sectors, management measures and processes, biodiversity requirements were not met, e.g. flow allocation to the Mlalazi Estuary in the Thukela MPA was not sufficient to prevent increased constricted/closed mouth conditions and associated poor water quality. Given that estuarine management straddles multiple sectors, a more robust intergovernmental engagement could assist in ensuring a balance in sectoral requirements and preventing mandate conflict between departments.",

Estuarine ecosystem type protection level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through improved estuarine management and ecosystem restoration to reduce ecosystem degradation.\nSeveral under protected ecosystem types can advance to Well Protected solely with improved management of fishing and water quality. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi.\nThe global support for 30% protection target (2030 Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3) represent a unique opportunity to garden international support and present funding opportunities to advance estuary protection. Conservation agencies around the coast are in the process to evaluate and extend estuarine protection with local community support, e.g. Olifants Estuary and Verlorenvlei (CapeNature).\nOngoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats. It is less clear, if this mechanism will also be able to protect invertebrates, fish and birds. However, there is no doubt that increased community engagement in protection will create an environment of trust and present opportunities for strengthening protection over time, either as a ‘stepping stone’ for increase formal protection over time or as a sufficient measure one its own.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) and/or Stewardship offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection. Lastly, increasing extent of protection alone will not advance estuarine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of ecosystems in protected areas needs improvement.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

    "text": "Approach\nThe protection level assessment for estuarine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets. While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target. In order for a estuarine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural / near natural ecological condition. If this target was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected. Additionally, any area inside a protected area that was in degraded condition had it’s contribution to the protection level target scaled according to the severity of the degradation.\nUsing as input data the South African Protected Areas Database (SAPAD) 2024Q4 (Department of Forestry Fisheries and Environment), South African estuary ecosystem map (van Niekerk 2020) and estuarine health condition as input data.\nEstuarine Condition (Health) scores (0-100) are assigned to Department of Water and Sanitation Present Ecological Status (PES) categories (A-F) and NBA Modification categories (Natural - Severely modified) according to the table below.\n#INSERT TABLE WITH HEALTH CATEGORIES: est_ets_cat.csv\nProtection Level is an indicator developed in South Africa that measures the representation of ecosystem types within the protected area network. The extent of each ecosystem type within the network is expressed as a proportion of the total extent. Four categories of Ecosystem Protection Level are calculated per ecosystem type (n= 22).\n\nWell Protected: 100% of the PA target within PA network; AND only A&B condition estuaries contribute; AND areas under heavy and very heavy fishing pressure are excluded from contributing\nModerately Protected: 50% to 99% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nPoorly Protected: 5% to 49% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nNot Protected: less than 5% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\n\nThe PA target was historically set at 20% for marine and estuarine ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework - the protected areas target was increased to 30% in the EPL calculations (previous time points (2018) were recalculated using this higher target). Ecosystem condition data (van Niekerk et al., 2025) for each time point allow for only good condition estuaries without heavey fishing pressure (especially systems under severe gill-netting pressure) to be considered representative for Well Protected status; while for Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected and Not Protected the condition of the estuaries is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets such that higher integrity / condition estuaries contribute more to meeting protected areas targets than low integrity / condition estuaries.",

    "text": "Approach\nEcosystem Threat Status is a headline indicator established for assessing how close ecosystem types are to collapsing or losing vital aspects of their structure, function, or composition.\nEach of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types were placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more here: chl_rle_explained.qmd // [For consistency with NBA 2018, the NBA 2025 ETS assessment follows the methods developed by Nel et al. (2007) and modified by van Deventer et al. (2019).] The approach uses the proportion of each ecosystem type that is in a good to fair condition (PES class A B and C) and a set of thresholds. If less than 20% of a type (measured by length of river segment) is in a A or B condition then the type is categorised as Critically Endangered; if between 20-35% of the type is in A or B condition then the type is categorised as Endangered; if less than 60% of the type is in A or or C condition then the type is categorised as Vulnerable; if none of these thresholds are crossed then the type is Least Concern. This method aligns with the South African Framework for Threatened ecosystems but not the IUCN RLE 1.1. Processes to transition to the IUCN framework are underway - but in the interest of comparing past results, the 2011 methods have been implemented.",

    "text": "Ecosystem assessments\nOf South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types, 45% are threatened, particularly smaller ecosystem types of restricted distribution. Several small, high-value ecosystem types are at risk of ecosystem collapse, which could compromise food, job and climate security (Key Message A2).\nOverall, coastal and shelf ecosystems are at higher risk of ecosystem collapse, and the most threatened ecosystem functional groups are bays, deepwater biogenic beds, muddy shelves and rocky ecosystems on the shelf. Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk (Key Message A2).\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types now have some representation in the MPA network, but only 20% are Well Protected (Key Message B4). Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves, and open oceans are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s marine protected area estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. Importantly, however, the ecological condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs also needs improvement (Key Message C2) for ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status. Ocean governance also needs to better consider and involve people in conservation initiatives (Key Message C1), diversify protection models, and address issues that undermine the legitimacy of conservation areas.\nIn the marine realm, 17% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected (see intersection of marine threat status and protection level page). These ecosystem types are found on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge, parts of the Agulhas Bank and parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of the 163 marine ecosystem types in South Africa, including (A) 128 combined bentho-pelagic (shelf) and 22 deep-sea benthic (deep-sea) types and (B) 13 deep-sea pelagic types.

    "text": "Species assessments\nMarine species are assessed in terms of their stock status and/or threat status. Stock status refers to the resource status from a fisheries management perspective, whereas species threat status focuses on extinction risk using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria.\nThere is increasing knowledge on stock status of resources, with evidence of resource recovery for some species linked to improved fisheries and spatial management (Key Message A5). This shows that fish stocks can recover with effective collaborative management of effort, catch and area. However, some inshore resources are increasingly depleted, and abalone and west coast rock lobster are Endangered. Illegal fishing plays a key role in the poor status of these species (Key Message A6).\n\n\n\nCaption to be added\n\n\nOf the 494 marine species assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria and thresholds, 36% are considered threatened (Key Message B1). However, this is an inflated estimate of the actual proportion of marine taxa that are threatened because species that are at risk and/or economically important have been prioritised for assessment, with few marine taxonomic groups being comprehensively assessed.\nSharks, rays and chimaeras are one of the most threatened groups across all realms. A re-assessment of South Africa’s seabreams showed improved threat status for three species while two have become more threatened. Of the 128 (may need update) South African shallow reef building corals assessed globally, 34% are threatened by climate change (Key Message A1).\nMarine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency across all realms, signalling the need to address knowledge gaps, improve monitoring (Key Message C3), and increase capacity for marine species red listing (Key Message C3). High levels of data deficiency compromise effective species and ecosystem management, spatial planning, and decision-making.",

    "text": "Pressures and ecological condition\n\n\nThere are many interacting pressures cumulatively affecting marine ecosystems and species. Key pressures impacting marine biodiversity include fishing (including industrial, recreational and illegal fisheries), coastal development (including ports and harbours), pollution, shipping, mining, freshwater flow reduction, lethal shark control measures and climate change.\nFishing, petroleum activities and shipping are widespread sectors resulting in many pressures on multiple ecosystem components and species. Fishing, particularly industrial fishing, continues to exert the greatest pressures on marine biodiversity (Key Message A5) impacting ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (Key Message B3).\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas have the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures.\n\n\n\n\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which increase access for fishing, alter shorelines and circulation, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. Pollution including industrial, municipal and noise pollution are key escalating pressures. Seismic surveys to detect potential offshore oil and gas resources have been expanding into deeper waters and, together with shipping and other sources of underwater noise, pose uncertain risks to marine ecosystems. Renewable energy production is important in achieving energy security and reducing climate change impacts but marine renewable energy development requires careful consideration of marine biodiversity impacts.\n\n\nThe first groundtruthing of marine ecosystem condition shows that pressure mapping is an effective proxy at broad national scales, but that finer scale pressure mapping can improve condition estimates. However, despite their importance in spatial planning, most marine pressure data are outdated, leading to missing pressures, poor resolution of some pressures, and inaccuracy of pressure impacts on ecosystem condition. Increased monitoring is needed to support assessment of ecosystem and species (Key Message B5), and to quantify ecological condition more accurately for both biodiversity assessment and guiding management.\nThe impacts of cumulative pressures also warrant consideration at multiple scales, particularly in evaluating the impacts of expanding and diversifying ocean economy activities. Failure to account for indirect and cumulative impacts will mean that important impacts are missed, resulting in poor spatial planning and decisions, with negative impacts on people and the environment (Key Message A2).\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of ecological condition showing the spatial distribution of marine areas in natural/near natural, moderately degraded, severely degraded or very severely degraded state.",

The Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf is threatened by demersal trawling that persists over much of the extent of this ecosystem type2 in addition to flow reduction. Similarly, the KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf has been modified by flow reduction and the demersal inshore crustacean inshore fishery that has subsequently ceased. The Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge has also been subject to intensive demersal trawling and high demersal longline effort leading to poor ecological condition. Both these ecosystem types were reported as Critically Endangered in 20183 under IUCN RLE Criterion C/D with four additional small ecosystem types listed under this category in 2025 when strictly applying IUCN RLE Criterion B.\nThe Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic is impacted by ongoing flow reduction and marine mining. Cape Bay, which includes Table and Saldanha Bay, has very high cumulative pressures with ongoing degradation linked to port and harbour activities. The Aliwal Shoal Reef Complex falls entirely within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) but ongoing linefishing, waste water discharge and lethal shark control measures cause this ecosystem type, which is of restricted distribution, to be classified as Critically Endangered. Further work to support reef classification and measure ecosystem condition is recommended along with management to reduce pressures in the MPA.\n\n\n\nFauna including grunter, kobs and prawns from the Critically Endangered KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf. © Kerry Sink\n\n\nThere are 31 Endangered ecosystem types (19%) which cover 0.9% extent of the marine realm area. Many of these are ecosystem types of limited extent that were uplisted (considered more threatened) relative to 2019 due to the application of global standards in 2025. For example, False and Walker Bay, St Helena Bay and Eastern Agulhas Bays (Algoa and St Francis) are all Endangered under either criterion B1 or B2 of the IUCN RLE.\n\n\n\nFalse and Walker Bay ecosystem type is now considered Endangered. © Peter Chadwick\n\n\nVulnerable ecosystem types cover 3.4% of the ocean space, with 36 ecosystem types (22%) falling within this category. All three kelp ecosystem types in South Africa are Vulnerable with cumulative fishing activities playing a key role in declining condition. Two of the 13 pelagic ecosystem types are threatened (South Atlantic Productive Margin Water and Upwelled Agulhas Current Margin Water), both of these being Vulnerable. Key pressures driving decline in condition include large pelagic fishing and mid water trawling. In 2025, all three coral communities were assessed as Vulnerable under the IUCN RLE criterion B3, with coral bleaching and associated ecosystem modification caused by climate change considered the key threat that could lead to ecosystem collapse. This also aligns with the IUCN RLE result for the Delagoa ecoregion in the regional assessments for the Western Indian Ocean4.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s three national coral community ecosystem types were assessed as Vulnerable in 2025 due their restricted distribution and the risk of climate change. These reef types are part of a regional ecosystem type. © Geoff Spiby\n\n\nNear Threatened (NT) ecosystem types are those that were evaluated to be within 10% of the threshold for Vulnerable. These ecosystems are at risk of ecosystem collapse if increasing pressures lead to further degradation in ecological condition. Examples include the Kingklip Koppies and the Agulhas Exposed Stromatolite Rocky Shore.\n\n\n\nThe Kingkilp Koppies is a Near Threatened ecosystem type off Gqeberha. A co-developed seabed management area will protect this ecosystem type from trawling but further collaborations are needed to secure this area from other activities that may impact the seabed.",

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria and drawing from previous marine NBA assessments. See the Ecosystem Threat Status and Redlist of Ecosystems explainer page for further information on South Africa’s approach to the assessment of Ecosystem Threat Status. The threat status of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was evaluated applying the IUCN Criteria A-D using pressure and condition maps from the 2018 assessment. Both the extent and severity of ecosystem degradation were considered by calculating the extent of each ecosystem type in each of the four ecosystem condition categories. Condition assessments are based on an ecosystem pressure matrix that is used to weight the impact of each pressure on each ecosystem type.\nAs pressure and condition data sets were not updated for the 2025 assessment, it is important to note that changes in ecosystem threat status are largely as a result of refined methods rather than recent loss or degradation in marine ecosystems. New aspects that were considered in the 2025 assessment included consideration of habitat loss (Criterion A), and the number of threat defined locations, ongoing drivers of ecological degradation (as opposed to pressures that have ceased e.g. due to new protected areas or changes in sea use) and stochastic events including climate change (Criterion B). Several ecosystem types have shifted into more threatened categories due to the automatic ecosystem extent thresholds provided by the IUCN but 13 ecosystem types had more positive (less threatened) results due to stricter thresholds for ongoing non-trivial decline in ecological condition.\nThe application of the IUCN global standards supported a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of previous deviations from the IUCN guidelines (such as altered thresholds under Criterion B in 2018) and provided a broader range of plausible results. It also led to the identification of new research priorities and recommendations relevant to current ecosystem mapping efforts and future ecosystem condition assessments that will strengthen future assessments.",

    "text": "Marine ecosystem types\nThe 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment used the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map (Figure 1) to assess the state of 163 marine ecosystem types around mainland South Africa. See the subantarctic territory page for an overview of the marine ecosystem types in the Prince Edward Islands. South Africa’s mainland maritime domain (territorial seas plus exclusive economic zone) extends from the dune base to 200 NM seaward, representing an area of approximately 1.07 million km2 and extending to a depth of about 5 500 m. The continental shelf width varies between ~2 and 260 km, and the shelf break depth ranges between 80 and 600 m, being terraced in places (de Wet and Compton, 2021). The Agulhas Bank is a 116 000-km2 triangular extension of the continental shelf that supports many endemic species. Shelf areas constitute approximately 40% of the mainland maritime domain with slope and abyssal ecosystems constituting the remaining 60%. South Africa has a coastline length of over 3 000 km. A separate coastal chapter covers the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Overview of South Africa’s 2023 hierarchical marine ecosystem classification with four bathomes (inner ring), 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (central ring), 58 Biogeographic Ecotypes (segments in outer ring) and 163 national Marine Ecosystem Types (not shown as a distinct ring). The number and relative width of each segment in the outer ring reflects the number of national marine ecosystem types nested within each of the Biogeographic Ecotypes. Where there is no number, there is only one ecosystem type associated with that biogeographic ecotype. Note that the shore and shelf do not separate into benthic and pelagic components but the deepsea includes overlapping benthic and pelagic layers. Adapted from Sink et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nThe 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map includes 128 shore and shelf ecosystem types which are considered bentho-pelagic, with 22 deepsea benthic and 13 deepsea pelagic ecosystem types (Figure 2). These 163 ecosystem types nest within 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (Figure 2) that align with those of the IUCN GET, except for minor differences in terminology and that South Africa included Bays as a distinct group. The Ecosystem Functional Groups are nested within bathomes, which represent geomorphological depth categories equivalent to ‘biomes’ in the IUCN GET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nSince 2004, South Africa has followed an approach that iteratively improves the classification and mapping of marine ecosystem types1. The Marine Ecosystem Map is informed by a broad range of data (Figure 3) derived from many types of surveys, including bathymetric, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity research. It is a large collaborative effort and the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map was developed with contributions from 29 authors from 18 different institutions. The map classification follows a nested hierarchy and the 2023 version sought to align with the IUCN GET structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The range of data that are being used to inform revisions to South Africa’s Marine Ecosystem Map. Increased research and data science investment is improving the marine ecosystem classification and map to support spatial biodiversity assessment and management.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the Marine Ecosystem Map\nLike its predecessors, the 2023 marine ecosystem map relied heavily on thematic approaches and expert-informed decision-making. Technological advancements are continuously improving our ability to monitor and survey ocean spaces, rapidly increasing the data available to characterise, delineate and understand marine ecosystems. Work is ongoing to update and improve the next version of the Marine Ecosystem Map, which will inform the following National Biodiversity Assessment.\nSANBI is implementing data and analytical frameworks to leverage the rapidly escalating volumes of ocean data to improve the Marine Ecosystem Map. This framework consists of a collection of scripted and documented workflows hosted in online project repositories. The scripted workflow components can be updated as new data or better methods become available, can be maintained despite turnover in staff and guiding experts, and are making inroads towards more transparent and reproducible science. This data-driven and reproducible approach has included collation of a suite of environmental gridded data layers and biodiversity survey datasets.\nIn regions where sufficient biodiversity data occur, the environmental layers and occurrence records are combined in statistical assemblage distribution models that estimate the co-occurring species assemblages and their preferred habitats, thereby predicting biodiversity patterns and characterising their composition. In regions where insufficient biodiversity data have been collected for the biodiversity analyses, gridded environmental layers are combined in environmental classifications (cluster analyses) to delineate unique habitats (Figure 3). The outputs from the assemblage distribution models and the environmental clusters are used as evidence, together with published biogeographic patterns, to consider updates to the ecosystem map. Updates to ecosystem components or types, such as newly mapped submarine canyons and kelp forests mapped from satellite data2 are being incorporated in the ecosystem map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1 . Kelp ecosystem types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge brown algae of the order Laminariales fringe rocky shores of temperate and high-latitude regions, creating kelp forest ecosystem types that cover over 30% of shallow rocky reefs globally. They are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and offer many social and economic benefits, including fishing, ecotourism and a variety of kelp-derived products that include animal and human food products, fertilisers, cosmetic and health care products. Evidence of human use of kelp ecosystem species in South Africa has been dated to about 70 000 years ago.\nDunga et al. (2024) created the first comprehensive high-resolution map of canopy forming coastal kelp in South Africa, covering the spatial distribution of Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida and Macrocystis pyrifera2. That work highlighted the need for improved long-term monitoring and a complete national map of kelp distribution.\nEmerging and ongoing research is addressing some of these gaps. The IUCN Seaweed Specialist Group will review available data globally by region, while fostering research collaborations. Local projects advancing kelp forest research include an investigation of marine biodiversity in South African kelp forests and a Masters project to map subsurface kelp forests in South Africa using remotely sensed data, and to assess how they will respond under different climate change scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated environmental layers have been organised by topical project groups, which include oceanography, geology and geomorphology. A suite of oceanographic (physical, chemical and phytoplankton) variables for surface and seafloor depths were downloaded from the Bio-ORACLE platform and calculated from Copernicus Marine Service satellite products and regional ocean model hindcasts provided by SAEON and SOMISANA. Updated sediment data were sourced from collaborators, greatly increasing the inventory of marine sediment sample and seafloor description records. Interpolated maps of sediment characteristics were additionally sourced from dbSEABED. Geomorphological variables included a new, national-scale, 100-m2 resolution bathymetry map3, from which derived variables such as slope angle, bathymetric position index and rugosity were calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. South Africa’s submarine canyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons are steep-sided valleys that cut into the continental slope and play an important role in connecting coastal and deep-sea environments by facilitating the vertical movement of water, sediments, and nutrients. Many of these canyons host complex terrain, diverse substrate types, habitats and species, including vulnerable marine ecosystem indicators, such as cold-water corals and sponges. They act as important nursery and feeding grounds for a variety of benthic and pelagic species, some of which are conservation priorities, such as the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Furthermore, submarine canyons can act as refuges from anthropogenic pressures, such as trawling, in areas where steep slopes and complex terrain limit human access.\nDespite their ecological importance, many of South Africa’s submarine canyons have remained unknown and unmapped due to limited coverage of high-resolution bathymetry data. The release of the 2024 national-scale bathymetric map at 100-m resolution, combined with additional unpublished multibeam echosounder datasets, has enabled a substantial advance in the mapping of submarine canyon features in South Africa, increasing the number of canyon polygons from 39 in 2018 to over 120. This updated canyon map enhances knowledge on canyon classification and geomorphological processes, identifies shelf-breaching canyons that influence shelf ecology, supports habitat predictions for coelacanths and other species, and will improve the delineation of canyon ecosystem types in the next Marine Ecosystem Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. South Africa’s newly mapped submarine canyons (red outline) overlayed on the new bathymetry map3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant strides were also made in the collation of marine biodiversity records in a biodiversity occurrence database. Data were sourced from online data repositories, such as OBIS and GBIF and requested from a network of collaborators at a variety of government and tertiary research institutions. In October 2025, the database contained 1 310 081 records from 7 726 marine species and 12 data sources, representing a growing collection of biodiversity data in waters around South Africa. Although only a selection of marine survey datasets have been used in assemblage distribution models, the vision is to build a comprehensive biodiversity database that will enable presence-only modelling of biodiversity patterns and species turnover across broad taxonomic groups sourced from many datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneBox 3. Artificial intelligence and the Southern Africa Marine Biodiversity Reference Image Collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs underwater imaging technology becomes more accessible and widespread, the volume of visual data from marine surveys has outpaced capacity for manual annotations. This has created a need to improve para-taxonomic capacity and AI-powered solutions that can reliably and efficiently extract species occurrence and count data from underwater biodiversity surveys. In South Africa, YOLOv8 and BioCLIP2 models have been fine-tuned to identify marine fishes and invertebrates in Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) footage. These models rely on hierarchical taxonomic labels paired with curated images of species. More than 350 benthic invertebrate species across nine phyla have been indexed and catalogued in a standardised reference image database using the SMaTaR_ID framework. Pipelines have been developed for automating the detection of vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa in ROV videos, threatened seabreams of commercial importance in BRUVs and benthic epifauna for marine ecosystem classification and mapping. Ongoing work aims to expand the species included in the models through curation of high quality and diverse training datasets that underpin model accuracy.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of reproducible data and analytical pipelines marks a shift in ecosystem mapping methods, one that should improve efficiency, transparency and foster greater understanding and confidence in the resulting ecosystem map, which informs biodiversity management, spatial planning, and conservation efforts in South Africa. Further investment in data science will be needed to curate and integrate rapidly expanding data streams if South Africa is to maintain a robust evidence base to underpin improved ecosystem classification, mapping, assessment, planning, mainstreaming and decision-making.",

    "text": "South Africa’s unique terrestrial biodiversity is globally recognised, with high species diversity and exceptional levels of endemism (especially for plants). The wide climatic range and varied geology and topography result in an equally diverse set of 463 terrestrial ecosystem types. This natural heritage supports vibrant rural and urban land uses and provides essential ecosystem services. The steady loss of terrestrial habitat and decline in species populations to various human activities, set against a backdrop of accelerating climate change, paints an overall picture of decline in the biodiversity and ecosystem services on which we rely. Gains in protection of species and ecosystems (through biodiversity stewardship programs) and growing sustainable use and restoration efforts are a positive trend. Biodiversity inclusive spatial planning, a well established practice in South Africa, is a key tool in striking the balance between development and biodiversity.\n\n\n\nAgriculture in the Hemel-en-Aarde Valley, Western Cape (©Andrew Skowno)\n\n\n\n\n\n30%\nof 463 ecosystem types\nThreatened\n26%\nof 463 ecosystem types\nWell Protected\n\n\n\n14%\nof 24 678 taxa assessed\nThreatened\n77%\nof 2345 taxa assessed\nWell Protected\n\n\n\n\nThirty percent of South Africa’s terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as threatened, this translates to 11% of the remaining natural habitat. There has been an overall increase in the risk of collapse of terrestrial ecosystems since 2014. While a quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types are Well Protected the same percentage are Not Protected. The overall trend for protection is positive, with a steady increase in the Protected Areas network - primarily due to biodiversity stewardship programs. The full results can be found on the Terrestrial ecosystem threat status page and Terrestrial ecosystem protection level page.\nA total of 24 678 terrestrial taxa have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria. Of these, 14% of taxa are threatened, while in 2018, 13% of 22 667 assessed taxa were threatened. The only new taxonomic group included are the Spiders (2214 taxa) that have very low levels of threat only 4%, so the overall increase in the proportion of species threatened is an indication of many species in other taxonomic groups becoming more threatened. Species Protection Levels are increasing but greater gains could be made through more effective management of protected areas. An overview of species threat status and protection level in the terrestrial realm can be found on the Terrestrial species page; while detailed findings per taxonomic group can be found on the Species findings pages\nThe state of biodiversity is shaped by both current and historical pressures. Croplands cover a very large portion of the terrestrial realm (&gt;16%) but there has been limited expansion into natural areas in recent times. In contrast the expansion of settlements and mining are relevant both historically and currently. Certain activities, such as targeted poaching of succulent plant species and renewable energy installations represent new pressures on biodiversity. Climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity are increasingly prominent, with studies more clearly attributing species declines and landscape changes to temperature and rainfall regime change. A summary of the main pressures in the terrestrial realm can be found on the Terrestrial pressures page.\nPriority actions across all realms are summarised on the Priority actions page, and discussed in Key messages A2, A4, A6, B1, B3, B4, B5.",

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status results\nEcosystem threat status is a headline indicator established to assess how close ecosystem types are to collapsing (losing vital aspects of their structure, function, or composition). For the NBA 2025 (as for the NBA2018) the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework was applied systematically across all terrestrial ecosystem types. Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more about this indicator on the About ecosystem threat status page\nNearly one-third (141/463) of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems, representing 11% of the remaining natural habitat of South Africa, are threatened. Among these 63 are listed as Critically Endangered, 68 as Endangered, and 10 as Vulnerable (Table 1). Many of these ecosystems are concentrated in the key economic hubs, particularly in the south-western, north-eastern, and north-western regions of the country, where anthropogenic land-use activities and associated degradation pressures are major drivers of ecosystem change. Many of these threatened ecosystems have naturally restricted distributions, and accelerated habitat loss over the past three decades in these regions has compounded their vulnerability to collapse (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Changes to the National Vegetation Map\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, the National Vegetation Map has been refined, increasing the number of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems from 456 to 463. These boundary adjustments and the addition of new types have influenced both the potential/historical extent of some ecosystems and their threat status categorisation. Refer to National Vegetation Map Project for more details on these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Summary of the assessment outcomes; including the number of ecosystem types per category & proportion of the natural areas remaining per category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory (IUCN RLE)\nNumber of ecosystems\nPercentage of threatened ecosystem types\nNatural extent remaining within South Africa in 2022 (km²)\nPercentage of the remaining natural extent\nPercentage of total terrestrial landmass extent\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered\n63\n13.6%\n9175.151\n0.9%\n0.7%\n\n\nEndangered\n68\n14.7%\n70047.437\n7.1%\n5.5%\n\n\nVulnerable\n10\n2.2%\n30431.996\n3.1%\n2.4%\n\n\nLeast Concern\n322\n69.5%\n871290.432\n88.8%\n68.9%\n\n\nTotal\n463\n100%\n980945.016\n100%\n77.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, the main pressures on terrestrial ecosystems include habitat loss due to croplands, human settlements and plantation forestry. Since 1990, croplands and plantations have not expanded significantly but human settlements continue to expand; these pressures are key factors in the Red List of Ecosystem assessments. Pressures such as invasive alien plants and rangeland overstocking are also important; degrading ecosystem processes and functions. New data on the distribution of invasive alien plants1–5 over large portions of South Africa has contributed to improved assessments, especially of Fynbos and Grassland ecosystem types (Key Message A4). However, there is still no comprehensive, spatially explicit dataset on land degradation for the country, which limits the ability to fully assess and track these impacts. For a more about pressures in the terrestrial realm refer to the Terrestrial pressures page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map (A) shows the historical extent of terrestrial threatened ecosystem types in South Africa, with the inset graph indicating the number of ecosystem types in each Red List of Ecosystems category. Map (B) Shows the remaining natural extent (circa 2022) of threatened terrestrial ecosystems; white areas represent non-natural areas such as croplands, built-up areas, mines, dams and tree plantations. The inset graph in (B) shows the percentage of the total remaining natural natural habitat (980,945 km²) within each category\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome level results\nA pattern first highlighted in the 2018 RLE assessment6 remains evident: threat levels vary widely across South Africa’s biomes. Fynbos and Grassland are most affected by human-driven and degrading pressures. In Fynbos, 40 ecosystems are Critically Endangered and 27 Endangered, together accounting for 53% of its 126 types. Grassland has 24 (33%) threatened ecosystems, encompassing four Critically Endangered, 14 Endangered, and six Vulnerable. These threatened ecosystems cover about 25% of the remaining natural extent in Fynbos and 28% in Grassland. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt is the most threatened biome, with all its ecosystem types listed as threatened. Other biomes face moderate risk, including Albany Thicket (nine threatened ecosystems, 20% of remaining extent) and Savanna (19, 7%). The Nama-Karoo is the least threatened, reflecting relatively lower pressure on its ecosystems (Table 2, Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

RLE assessments in the terrestrial realm will improve over time as data on ecosystem condition within forests and rangelands (including much of the Grassland, Savanna, Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo and Desert biomes) are gathered, validated and incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Threatened ecosystems per biome, showing (A) the percentage of ecosystem types per biome that fall within each threat category, and (B) the percentage of the total natural habitat remaining in each biome that falls within each threat category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvincial level results\nSimilarly, threat levels also vary considerably across the nine provinces of South Africa. Gauteng, the country’s economic hub, has the highest share of threatened habitat by extent (52%), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (39%) and Mpumalanga (34%). In the Western Cape, Limpopo and North West approximately 15% of the remaining habitat is categorised as threatened, though there are many more threatened ecosystem types in the Western Cape, a product of the extremely high landscape and plant diversity. In contrast the Northern Cape, with its vast arid landscapes has only 11 threatened ecosystems (covering less than 1% of the remaining natural habitat), making it the least threatened province in the country, however, rapidly expanding mining footprints on the coast and interior combined with landscape level changes in plant community composition (linked to a combination of rangeland management, drought, climate change), are cause for concern (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

    "text": "Red List Index of Ecosystems\nThe Red List Index of Ecosystems (RLIe) tracks changes in ecosystem threat status over time7,8. The methods focus the indicator on genuine changes in status by accounting for the impact of improved data at later time points. RLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear, comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. RLIe was calculated for 463 terrestrial ecosystems at the biome level, across four RLE assessment periods: 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2024. The emerging trends reveal a complex picture of both resilience and vulnerability across South Africa’s biomes.\nThe Indian Ocean Coastal Belt has experienced the steepest decline and has the lowest overall RLIe, falling from 0.50 in 2014 to 0.43 in 2024. All ecosystem types in this biome are threatened and over time they are moving into higher risk categories. This steep downward trend reflects growing pressures from land-use conversion, including the expansion of croplands, urban development, and plantations. The Fynbos Biome, renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, faced substantial histroical pressures resulting low RLIe scores (0.62) but these are reasonably stable since 2018 suggesting that the main drivers of change, particularly agricultural pressure in lowland areas, have been entrenched for many years. In the Desert, Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes there are fewer threatened ecosystems and hence slightly higher RLIe (~0.8) but these scores dropped substantially since 2014, suggesting accelerating pressures.\nAt the national level, South Africa’s overall RLIe declined slightly from 0.82 to 0.79 between 2014 and 2024, signaling a slow but steady increase in ecosystem threat. The divergent trajectories seen across individual biomes highlight the importance of targeted, biome-specific conservation efforts to address the primary drivers of change shaping ecosystem threat status across the country.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

The Albany Thicket biome occurs in the eastern and southern cape and contains a unique combination of plant forms with an Eocene origin and unique evolutionary history4. The Forest biome is characterised by small patches distributed across the winter and summer rainfall areas of the country. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biome represents the southernmost extent of the moist tropical seaboard of East Africa. The Desert biome occupies a small portion of the extreme north west of the country, forming the southernmost extent of the Namib Desert.\nThe vegetation map reflects the historical extent of the vegetation prior to major anthropogenic land conversion (ca. 1750). By estimating and mapping the extent and state of our natural ecosystems before large scale human modifications, there is a baseline against which the state and extent of ecosystems can be monitored. In South Africa we have a wealth of information that allows for the approximation of historical extent5,6. The arid and mountainous character of much of South Africa also means that many landscapes have not seen extensive habitat loss - making estimation of historical extent feasible.",

    "section": "Seven broad themes for action",
    "text": "Seven broad themes for action\nThe fifteen key messages of NBA 2025 highlight a range of actions that can be summarised into seven broad themes:\n\nBiodiversity inclusive spatial planning (Key Messages A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, B4): Biodiversity and ecological infrastructure are powerful socio-economic engines contributing to South Africa’s development. The negative impacts on biodiversity, both direct (e.g., land clearing, built infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., pollution, changes to natural processes), from land and sea use change can be avoided or minimised through effective biodiversity inclusive spatial planning. South Africa has well-established provincial spatial biodiversity planning and prioritisation processes, plus screening tools for biodiversity sensitivity in development sites (Figure 1). Ongoing investment is needed to keep these plans and tools current with the latest biodiversity data, and ensure they inform decision-making at national, provincial and local levels. Marine Spatial Planning processes offer robust opportunities for biodiversity plans to influence use in the marine realm and along the coast. Biodiversity inclusive spatial plans can also guide ecosystem restoration and expansion of protected and conserved areas.\nPolicy development or refinement (Key Messages A3, A4, A7, B2, B4, C1): National, provincial and local policies and regulations unlock biodiversity and ecological infrastructure’s benefits to people. NBA 2025 identifies key sectors needing effective policies (providing required frameworks, incentives and governances structures) to address pressures on biodiversity. For example, policy gaps around pollution, freshwater flow requirements to marine environments and management of invasive species introduction pathways can be addressed through cross-sectoral approaches that strengthen interconnectivity between people and biodiversity. Closing these gaps requires strengthening collaboration between all levels of governments, particularly to local government where targeted capacity building and technical support is needed to help municipalities integrate biodiversity conservation and sustainable use responsibilities into their policies and operations.\nEnforcement and compliance (Key Messages A3, A7, B2, B5, C1, C3): Although South Africa has strong environmental policies, effective enforcement and compliance mechanisms are required to achieve biodiversity conservation outcomes. Compliance and enforcement reporting should be strengthened as this provides both impetus for implementation and means of monitoring progress towards targets. Limited capacity and budgets for compliance and enforcement are major challenges, and effective cooperation and innovative solutions are needed to transform the relationship between people and nature, address the underlying causes of non-compliance and enable adaptive management.\nManagement plans and programme/project implementation (Key Messages A1, A5, A7, B1, B2, B4, B5, C2, C3): Co-produced local management plans and projects/programmes are key tools for ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity, protecting livelihoods, and restoring nature’s contributions to people. Scientifically-sound project/programme design and robust project management are essential for cost-effective, successful implementation with lasting positive impact.\nInnovation, access to and transfer of technology (Key Messages A4, A6, C2, C3): Innovation is required to address pressures on biodiversity and persistent compliance and implementation challenges. For example, new approaches for legal wildlife trade may deliver better results than decades of enforcement efforts that have had limited success. Crucial investments include artificial intelligence and new technologies for remote sensing, data science and forensics, alongside fostering innovations in citizen science and stewardship of biodiversity. Building partnerships that facilitate exchange of skills, knowledge and best practice is key.\nData collection and monitoring (Key Messages A1, A3, A4, A5, B3, B5, C2): Effective biodiversity monitoring depends on continuous long-term data collection and analysis. Without this foundation, biodiversity inclusive spatial planning and biodiversity assessments are compromised. Interventions to mitigate pressures on biodiversity must be planned using the best possible data to ensure return on investment. Measuring impact through targeted data collection and monitoring enables adaptive management of current projects, informs future project improvements, supports meaningful reporting, and contributes to national datasets.\nInnovative financing and resource mobilisation (Key Messages C3): Current financial flows are insufficient for South Africa’s ambitious biodiversity targets. It is essential to ensure that the baseline funding for biodiversity is not eroded while exploring new sources. There is urgent need for coordinated action to scale up innovative public and private financing mechanisms. Blended finance models, biodiversity offsets, green bonds, and other nature-positive finance solutions can help bridge this funding gap, while partnerships with the private sector and development finance institutions can unlock considerable additional capital. Strategic resource allocation and measurable outcomes depend on investment in robust financial tracking systems, natural capital accounting, and transparent reporting.",

    "text": "The framing of action, response and intervention plans\nThe NBA 2025 presents a suite of findings that can inform diverse international, national and local biodiversity initiatives, providing context, indicators and avenues for intervention.\nAt the global level, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets 23 urgent targets for 2030 and four outcome-oriented goals for 2050. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration focuses on interventions to reverse biodiversity loss. The various assessments by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) guide global thinking on biodiversity trends and solutions (e.g., the IPBES Transformative Change Assessment emphasises that transformative change requires a redefined relationship between people and nature). The NBA provides national context and important trends in biodiversity for these processes, and contributes many indicators specifically needed to report against South Africa’s international commitments.\nNational initiatives include South Africa’s National Development Plan’s 2030 and SANParks’ ‘Vision 2040’which reimagines the role of conservation as a catalyst of redress, economic advancement and job creation through the Mega Living Landscapes. Furthermore, South Africa’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is being updated around four strategic dimensions: i) conservation (including formal protection, stewardship, OECMs, and targeted species efforts); ii) enhancing nature’s contributions to people (including inclusivity in the biodiversity economy); iii) mainstreaming biodiversity (across all sectors and levels of government and society); and iv) resource mobilisation (innovative, sustainable, and diversified strategies).\nThere are also many local, district and provincial-level initiatives under which actions, responses and interventions can be framed. South Africa has limited resources to implement these plans, and must capitalise on past successes, existing initiatives and strategic innovation to meet national targets for both biodiversity and development. The NBA can guide these initiatives and provide a wealth of data products to support decision-making.",

    "section": "Reflecting on twenty years since the first NBA",
    "text": "Reflecting on twenty years since the first NBA\nThese seven themes have remained consistent across all iterations of the NBA, although each has been substantially refined and expanded over the years. Global and national approaches to biodiversity conservation and management have seen important, nuanced changes. For example, the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004 called for expanding the formal (i.e., state-owned) protected area network, but today’s approach recognises that very effective conservation also happens outside formal reserves through private landowner initiatives (e.g., biodiversity stewardship programmes) and community-led other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). The often repeated calls for better regulations and enforcement for certain pressures are now augmented by innovative technologies (e.g., satellite monitoring, AI-powered wildlife tracking), and the move towards a whole-of-society custodianship approach to nature. Similarly, the perennial challenge of inadequate funding has led to numerous diverse and innovative finance mechanisms for biodiversity and  greater focus on economic systems to benefit both nature and people. The NBA has grown in content and participation, and reflects how conservation thinking and practice has developed.\n\n\n\nIt has been 20 years since the release of the first NBA and the calls for action in NSBA 2004, NBA 2011 and NBA 2018 are all still relevant. The various intervention plans that are co-produced or updated after NBA 2025’s release, in participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, could reflect the past calls to action, while using the modern nuances of biodiversity conservation and nature’s contributions to people",

    "text": "South Africa has assessed the threat status of 25 474 indigenous taxa from 15 taxonomic groups using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria, which reflects a species’ extinction risk. There are several extinct categories, three threatened categories (Critically Endangered [CR], Endangered [EN], Vulnerable [VU]), as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD) and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range restricted endemic species that have a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km2 occurring where there are no anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are priorities for inclusion in national conservation interventions despite them qualifying as Least Concern under the IUCN system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered Brenton blue butterfly (Orachrysops niobe) (a), known only from Knysna, has been listed as possibly extinct, with the only known population lost during the 2017 Garden Route fires where the extensive spread of woody invasive alien plants were the main driver of the intensity and extent of the fires (© Justin Bode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of 20 sandy beach invertebrates have been assessed for the first time in NBA 2025 and the giant granulated calloused beach pillbug (Tylos granulatus) (b) is one of four Endangered species, with much of its habitat along the West Coast being impacted or lost due to mining, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp (© Linda Harris).\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the assessed taxa, 0.5% are extinct or possibly extinct (1224 taxa ) and a further 3 659 taxa are threatened with extinction (14%). South Africa has high levels of species endemism – 75% of freshwater crab, 67% of plant, 57% of spider, 56% of amphibian, 52% of butterfly, 49% of freshwater fish, 44% of fairy shrimp (Anostraca), 38% of reptile and 36% of seabream taxa are endemic. For all of these groups, levels of threat to endemic taxa are higher than for all indigenous taxa (Figure 1). Overall, 20% of endemic taxa are threatened with extinction (3 213 taxa) and 0.8% are extinct or possibly extinct (120 taxa).\nThe most threatened taxonomic groups in South Africa are cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras), as 42 % are threatened. Most of these species are wide ranging and much of their declines can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other parts of the world. Six of the 13 endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened indicating that the country has a responsibility to reverse declines of these charismatic predators. When only considering endemics, South Africa’s freshwater fishes are the most threatened comprehensively assessed group with 66% of species threatened due to competition with invasive alien fish and degradation of their freshwater systems through water abstraction, pollution and inappropriate sedimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Degradation to South Africa’s arid wetland ecosystems is threatening this unique group of species, as Anostraca are dependent on ephemeral wetlands. Freshwater crabs were first assessed in South Africa in 2007, and a repeat assessment for this NBA indicates that 13% of species are threatened. Due to poor taxonomic knowledge and a paucity of occurrence records, most marine and coastal invertebrates cannot be assessed, however, a sample of utilised marine species show that 18% are threatened. Of the 20 coastal invertebrates assessed (the first sandy beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species globally), four (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further three (15%) are Near Threatened. The pressures on coastal invertebrates are mainly mining on the West Coast, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp from the shore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Species threat status across the realms with the bars representing percentage of taxa in each category.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of threatened taxa varies across realms (Figure 2). Of the species that have been assessed, the marine realm currently has the highest proportion of threatened taxa (36%), followed by the estuarine realm (18%). Both the marine and estuarine assessments have prioritised economically important and charismatic species over comprehensive taxonomic assessments for full taxonomic groups, and this may have inflated the proportion of threatened taxa. Species assessments in the marine realm are also limited by gaps in taxonomic knowledge, and the lack of information on species distribution, life histories and long-term population trends has resulted in high levels of data deficiency. The terrestrial assessments also include many Data Deficient taxa since many genera of plants and invertebrates still require taxonomic work and are not yet sufficiently well delineated for a threat status to be assigned. For the freshwater and terrestrial realms, complete taxonomic groups have been assessed, providing greater confidence in the results. Approximately 16% of freshwater and 14% of terrestrial taxa assessed to date are threatened. Despite lower threat percentages, the terrestrial realm has suffered the highest extinction toll (44 confirmed extinct species and a further 77 highly likely to be extinct).",

    "text": "Species protection level\nSpecies protection level is used to determine how well the protected area network is conserving species. The indicator measures progress towards protecting a population persistence target for each species. As species persistence is dependent on the degree to which protected areas can mitigate threats that cause population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation. The categories for protection level are: Well Protected where the species persistence target is met or exceeded by the protected area network; Moderately Protected where between 50 and 99% of the species persistence target is met; Poorly Protected where between 5 and 49% of the species persistence target is met; and Not Protected where less than 5% of the species persistence target is met.\nThis indicator has been used to assess terrestrial and freshwater species within six taxonomic groups (Figure 3). Plants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 taxa. Peripheral taxa, which have less than 5% of their distribution range occurring in South Africa, were excluded from the analysis. Protection level has been calculated for 2 449 taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Protection level for six South Africa’s indigenous terrestrial and freshwater taxonomic groups. Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa). Protection level for all taxa (A); protection level for South African endemics (B). *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the protection level is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nExcept for freshwater fishes, South Africa’s protected area network protects species relatively well, with most groups having over 50% of taxa qualifying as Well Protected (Figure 3 A). The protection level of birds and reptiles is particularly good, with both groups having over 85% of their taxa qualifying as Well Protected.\nProtection levels of endemic species are lower than for all species (Figure 3 B). Freshwater fishes and amphibians have the highest proportion of endemic species that are Not Protected, 36% and 19% respectively. Endemic mammals are of some concern as 20 taxa (34%) are Poorly Protected and four taxa (7%) are Not Protected.\nThe effectiveness of protected areas in mitigating threats to species within their borders reveals some interesting case studies. While 38% of freshwater fishes are well represented within protected areas, many species are not being effectively protected due to the presence of invasive alien fish species within the protected areas’ freshwater systems and limited management interventions in place to control these invasive species. Pollution and over-abstraction of water upstream of the protected area boundary further compromise protection effectiveness. Consequently, only 23% of South African freshwater fish species qualify as Well Protected once the impact of these pressures is taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaubenya namaquensis, a rare and restricted range species from Namaqualand, experienced a genuine improvement in protection level status as a result of the declaration of new protected areas between 2018 and 2025. © Nick Helme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critically Endangered Cape Flats frog (Microbatrachella capensis) (© Kurt van Wyk) improved in protection level due to rehabilitation of wetland habitats within the Table Mountain National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor birds, 55 species (8.3%) experienced protection level category downgrades once effectiveness is included. The effectiveness adjustment reduces the protection level score particularly for wetland species (e.g., flamingos, cranes, pelicans) and raptors (e.g., vultures, harriers).\nAmphibians and plants are also significantly impacted by threats occurring within protected area boundaries. As a result, 7% of amphibian species and plant taxa drop down a category of protection. While amphibians are impacted by high levels of invasive alien species within protected areas, the main reason for plants not being effectively protected is due to high levels of plant poaching in the protected areas of Namaqualand.\nEighteen mammal taxa (7%) drop a category of protection due to protected areas not effectively mitigating against pressures; poaching and bushmeat hunting within reserves is a particular problem for mammals.\nThe Species Protection Level indicator has recently been adapted into the Species Protection Level Index, following the principles of the IUCN Red List Index of species. The index will be used for national and international biodiversity reporting. More details on the development of the index and the emerging trends can be found online.\nMany species have improved in their protection level since the last assessment in 2018. A total of 5% of plant species assessed have improved in protection level with the newly proclaimed Mountain Zebra-Camdeboo Protected Environment, Gamsberg Nature Reserve, and Orange River Mouth Nature Reserve contributing most to improving protection levels. Nine bird species (1%), four amphibian species (3%), nine freshwater fish species (9%), eight (3%) mammal taxa and seven (2%) reptile species have shown improvements in protection level. The improved protection level for reptiles is specifically due to the newly proclaimed De Hoop Dam and Mphaphuli Protected Environments and the Thengwe Nature Reserve, all in in Limpopo province.",

Less than 30% of threatened amphibian, mammal and plant species, and only 5% of threatened freshwater fishes are Well Protected. On a positive note, nearly 60% of bird and reptile species are Well Protected.\nSome species have benefited from the expansion of protected areas and targeted management interventions, however these successes are limited and most threatened species remain under protected. For example, the Endangered freshwater fish species the Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseuodobarbus verloreni) has shifted from Not Protected to Poorly Protected following the declaration of a new protected area that now covers one of its populations. Unfortunately the broader pattern for freshwater fishes is that protected areas do little to shield species from ongoing pressures of invasive species, over-abstraction of water and pollution.\nSpecies threat status and protection level assessments provide a useful basis for guiding prioritisation processes. Highly threatened (Critically Endangered and Endangered) and under protected (Not Protected and Poorly Protected) species represent the most urgent need for conservation action, particularly when they are endemic to South Africa. Across all taxon groups 5% of taxa (127/2449) fall into this category, and the majority of these are South African endemics (80%, 104/127 taxa). Freshwater fishes and amphibians have the highest proportion of species in this category, 27% (26/96 assessed fishes) and 13% (17/133 assessed amphibians), respectively. Both groups make use of freshwater habitats, which are also typically threatened ecosystems. Five per cent of plant species and close to 10% of all assessed mammal species are both highly threatened and under protected. Bird and reptile taxon groups have fewer species (less than 2%) within this category, and these species include habitat specialists and very range-restricted species that require specific targeted protected area expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi) is Critically Endangered due to the high rate of loss and degradation of its preferred habitat, seasonal marshland, however, its Protection Level has improved from Not Protected to Poorly Protected, through concerted expansion of protected areas in Mpumalanga and southern KwaZulu-Natal (© Kyle Lloyd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clanwilliam sandfish (Labeo seeberi) is Endangered and Poorly Protected, as only one of its seven subpopulations receives protection in the Oorlogskloof Nature Reserve (© Jeremy Shelton)",

This indicator provides a systematic mechanism for tracking progress towards achieving Goal A of the GBF, which focuses on maintaining and enhancing ecosystem integrity.\nConceptually, the RLIe mirrors and complements the Red List Index8 (of species), offering comparable insights into ecosystem-level risk. It tracks changes in the threat status of ecosystems over time9,10, with all trend assessments derived directly from the outcomes of IUCN RLE assessments. This indicator reflects genuine changes in ecosystem status, accounting for improvements in data and understanding across assessment periods. Broad speaking, the RLIe represents the mean of ordinal ranks assigned to each risk category and is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\nRLIE_t = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} W_{C_{i,t}}}{W_{C_O} \\cdot n}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(W_{C_{i,t}}\\) represents the risk category rank for ecosystem \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\).\n\\(W_{C_O}\\) is the maximum category rank (Collapsed = 5).\n\\(n\\) is the total number of ecosystems, excluding Data-Deficient and/or Not Evaluated ecosystems.\n\nRisk category ranks:\n\nCollapsed = 5\nCritically Endangered = 4\nEndangered = 3\nVulnerable = 2\nNear Threatened = 1\nLeast Concern = 0\n\nRLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear and comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. The indicator is designed for flexible application, allowing trends to be assessed for overall risk categories, or by individual criteria to reveal key drivers of ecosystem change. In addition, the RLIe can be disaggregated by South African biome for naitonal reporitng, or ecosystem functional group, aligning with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology10,11 for global reporting.",

Resource constraints compromise the ability to understand, track and address the impacts of biodiversity loss and degradation on people and nature. To protect the country’s natural heritage for future generations, South Africa must move beyond business-as-usual and mobilise private sector investment and innovative finance solutions to fund biodiversity. | \n\nDespite gradual increases in nominal public sector spending, South Africa’s Biodiversity Expenditure Review highlights a concerning trend that real expenditure (adjusted for inflation) is declining, eroding the purchasing power of existing resources. This fiscal pressure, compounded by South Africa’s constrained macroeconomic environment, poses serious challenges to achieving the country’s biodiversity targets under the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). \n\n\n\nManaging South Africa’s biodiversity is a collective effort that requires collaboration and resources, and moving beyond business-as-usual to diversified and innovative finance solutions © Jeremy Shelton\n\n\nTo address this, the Biodiversity Expenditure Review strongly advocates for diversifying finance flows, including expanding private sector engagement, unlocking green finance instruments such as biodiversity bonds, and fostering public-private partnerships. Private sector partners, particularly financial institutions, have a key role to play in mobilising resources and innovative finance solutions to support more positive outcomes for biodiversity. Funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund offer opportunities to scale up efforts for biodiversity and climate, and complement traditional funding mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and others.  \nThe move towards a more collaborative, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach is key to building an effective resource base for the biodiversity sector and to support positive biodiversity outcomes. This is underpinned by building strong partnerships, exploring new opportunities, strengthening institutions, and building capacity and skills. The Biodiversity Finance Plan for the third NBSAP will provide a clear, evidence-based roadmap to mobilise and align financial resources. Importantly, the country needs to standardise biodiversity tagging across all sectors to improve the tracking and reporting of biodiversity-related expenditures. This is the foundation of a sustainable biodiversity finance framework for South Africa, one that safeguards the country’s exceptional natural heritage, supports socio-economic development, and ensures long-term investment.",

Human activities in different sectors, each with separate policies and practices, can impact on the same biodiversity and ecological infrastructure in different ways. Coordinated and collaborative planning and decision-making is essential to account for this interconnectedness. |\n\nBiodiversity provides benefits and essential services to people, like food, clean water and medicines, and enriches our cultural, spiritual and recreational practices. These services are dependent on intact ecosystems, healthy species populations and genetic diversity. The interconnectedness of biodiversity and human wellbeing is highlighted globally through the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity: conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of the components of biodiversity, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation. In South Africa, this interconnectivity is featured in the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity, which provides a vision for an inclusive, transformed society where biodiversity conservation and sustainable use ensure healthy ecosystems and equitable benefit-sharing for present and future generations.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives, and safeguarding biodiversity calls for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach Needs to be changed to updated one\n\n\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives of inclusive economic growth, job creation, and improved service delivery and wellbeing for all citizens. The National Development Plan calls for collective responsibility towards the biodiversity that underpins these national goals. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) can provide an opportunity for all actors in the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to work together and contribute to these national goals by strengthening the conservation of biodiversity; promoting and expanding the benefits derived from biodiversity; embedding biodiversity considerations across all sectors and levels of government and society; and strengthening financial and technical support for effective implementation.\nSouth Africa’s policy and legislative framework includes several tools to facilitate cross-sectoral planning and decision-making. Tools like Spatial Development Frameworks (developed at local, provincial and national level) and Marine Spatial Planning require multi-sectoral approaches to balance competing needs. Implementation of these frameworks, while sometimes challenging, can be improved by developing partnerships and working collaboratively. Some institutional arrangements already support this approach, for example, the Inland Water Ecosystem Liaison Committee, convened by the Department of Water and Sanitation, brings together all organs of state with shared mandates for managing and conserving rivers and wetlands. At the subnational level, catchment partnerships are an example of bringing together stakeholders from across government, civil society, research and the private sector to address natural resource challenges in a way that supports social and economic development. Collaborative action across government, all sectors and society towards a more nature positive and inclusive pathway will enable interconnectedness, resulting in thriving ecosystems, species and genetic diversity driving economic growth and wellbeing for all.",

Spatial biodiversity planning tools continue to guide strategic expansion efforts. By enabling better participation in conservation and restoration, addressing gaps in sustainable finance and enhancing effectiveness of protected and conserved areas, pressures on ecosystems and species can be further mitigated. | \n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas, to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Areas such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in partnership with value holders. (© Kerry Sink)\n\n\nExpanding the ecological representation of ecosystems and species in protected and conserved areas strengthens their effectiveness in reducing pressures on biodiversity. South Africa has made progress in expanding protected and conserved areas, with spatial planning guiding the inclusion of diverse terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems and their species. For example, the marine protected area network is spatially efficient and represents 83% of marine ecosystem types across 5.4% of South Africa’s ocean. Despite these advances, gaps remain in achieving fully representative coverage, particularly for estuarine and freshwater ecosystem types. Restoration initiatives, including controlling invasive species, could also increase effectiveness of these areas in protecting ecosystems and species. However, resources and capacity for management have not increased alongside the expansion of protected and conserved areas. \nProtected and conserved areas provide multiple benefits, including supporting sustainable jobs in tourism and the biodiversity economy, enhancing cultural and recreational experiences, and contributing to climate resilience and human wellbeing. Effective management of existing protected and conserved areas will ensure that progress made in expansion of these areas continues to deliver these benefits. Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework calls for the conservation of 30% of land, waters and seas by 2030 at global level, with attention to effectiveness, ecological representativity and equitable governance systems. South Africa, with innovative resourcing strategies (see key message C3), is committed to all elements of the target. \nProtected and conserved areas work well with community involvement. Diversified protection models and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), can provide new opportunities for community-led conservation, livelihood diversification and cultural heritage protection. Initiatives that provide opportunities for communities living in and around protected and conserved areas to become active participants should be enhanced and encouraged. Combining aspects of both natural and cultural heritage in protected area expansion can foster the involvement of indigenous and local communities. Inclusive and participatory stakeholder processes are needed for more effective protected areas that support thriving people and nature. The biodiversity sector must strengthen capacity for social processes across institutions to create innovative partnerships with community and industry. Securing sustainable finance, enhancing institutional capacity, and fostering innovative partnerships with communities and industry are essential to ensuring that protected and conserved areas continue to deliver long-term ecological, social and economic benefits.",

Over 90% of estuarine ecosystem types are threatened and less than 10% are Well Protected. Over 60% of river and wetland types are threatened, while less than 10% are Well Protected. These ecosystems face multiple pressures from altered water flows, pollution, land-use changes, poor land management and biological invasions. Barrier structures, such as roads, and commercial forestry further alter stream flow, groundwater recharge, and hydrology of rivers and wetlands. In estuaries, the availability of cheap gill nets from online retailers has led to an increase in illegal fishing, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. This indiscriminate fishing method impacts many biota, such as sharks, rays, invertebrates, birds, turtles, terrapins, and crocodiles, beyond just the targeted fish species.

They are important havens for many threatened and endemic species. Improving their condition will increase the diversity of benefits delivered as well as the number of people who benefit from aquatic ecosystem services.\nThe dire status of South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems has been documented since the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004. In response, ecological infrastructure, including rivers and wetlands, has received attention in various policy instruments, such as the National Infrastructure Plan and the recent National Wetland Policy. There have also been efforts to secure ecological infrastructure, and protect and rehabilitate rivers and wetlands. Estuary Management Plans have been or are being developed for more than 20% of systems. Most freshwater resources have been classified into levels of resource utilisation, although environmental allocations sometimes fall short of biodiversity requirements. However, these responses have yet to improve the threat status or protection level of aquatic ecosystems.\nInnovative approaches are needed that integrate social, economic and ecological considerations, and place people at the centre of environmental stewardship. Citizen science monitoring of aquatic systems is a powerful tool that assists communities to understand and appreciate these ecosystems, and the services they derive from them. In addition, the implementation of regulatory mechanisms such as environmental authorisations, water use licences and biodiversity offsets must include the requisite resources and capacity for compliance monitoring and enforcement. The recovery of fish and invertebrate resources in estuaries calls for a reduction in fishing pressure, prioritising ecological water reserves for estuaries, and increasing citizen awareness.",

Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure with coordinated efforts across all components. |\n\nFreshwater flows into the ocean are essential for functioning coastal and marine ecosystems and the species that live in them. Estuaries demonstrate this interconnectivity between land and sea, and more than 20% suffer severely reduced freshwater flow and 32% are under severe pollution pressure. Flow reduction and poor water quality cause poor coastal ecosystem condition and increased species threat in the estuarine and marine realms. South Africa has very few (only 62) remaining free-flowing rivers that reach the coast without substantial barriers limiting flows and species movement. The water from many of the country’s catchments is already fully allocated for human uses inland, leaving ever decreasing volumes to flow into the ocean.  \n\n\n\nFreshwater reaching the sea is not wasted. Sediment-rich clean water, flowing from catchments through estuaries into the ocean, is essential and provides multiple benefits such as nutrients for fish and sand for beaches and dunes. Actions have been identified to track progress in securing freshwater flow to the estuarine and marine realms. © Darren Hanner\n\n\nSufficient freshwater flow into the ocean maintains water quality, salinity regimes, and estuarine connectivity that supports fish nursery functions vital for marine fisheries. Freshwater flow enables the movement of sand and sediments, maintaining beaches and dunes, which are tourism and coastal resilience assets that help protect people from sea storms. Fisheries associated with muddy ecosystem types (e.g., prawns, sole) require mud delivery through freshwater flows to the sea. Species that move between marine and freshwater environments during their life cycle (e.g., eels [Anguilla spp.] and the commercially-important dusky kob [Argyrosomus japonicus]) are particularly vulnerable when estuarine connectivity and functioning are altered. \nEcological infrastructure, such as catchments, rivers and wetlands, together with built infrastructure, facilitates and regulates freshwater flows into the sea. There is an urgent need for a lead agency to coordinate the development of an officially accepted standard protocol for the determination and implementation of flow requirements for fluvial-dependent marine ecosystems and resources. Then, alignment of strategies amongst stakeholders, such as the National Water Resources Strategy and Water Resource Classification, can ensure that flow requirements are implemented. Coordinated monitoring, data management and sharing will further support this effort. Investing in water resource monitoring and reporting is crucial to understand trends in streamflow quality and quantity, including associated declining estuary and coastal ecosystem conditions. Natural capital accounting, including the subnational water resource accounts and Strategic Water Source Areas accounts provides insights into how water moves across the landscape. Catchment Management Agencies play a key role by encouraging partnerships across sectors for collaborative water governance. Finally, coastal and estuary management plans must detail freshwater allocation, fish resource use, water quality management and appropriate land-use activities.",

There are opportunities to improve fisheries sustainability at the ecosystem, species and genetic level while supporting more fair fisheries. Fisheries management plans that apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries can allow fisheries resources to recover for the benefit of food security and livelihoods. |\n\nFishing is one of the most enduring marine activities that supports food and job security. However, fishing exerts the greatest pressure on estuarine and marine biodiversity, with impacts on ecosystems, species and genetic diversity. Concentrated fishing pressure by multiple actors, including recreational fisheries, is the cause of ecosystem degradation in some areas and increases extinction risk of target and bycatch species. The many coastal species threatened by fishing include some endemic seabreams, several kob species and some invertebrates. Formerly common species like South African abalone (Haliotis midae), West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) and white mussels (Donax serra) are now Endangered due to overexploitation. Fishing has led to genetic consequences for seventy-four seabream (Polysteganus undulosus) and kob species (Sciaenidae). It also affects many seabirds, including the Critically Endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), and many sharks and rays. Fisheries management efforts have resulted in the partial recovery of some seabream species, including slinger (Chrysoblephus puniceus), carpenter (Argyrozona argyrozona) and Cape bream (Pachymetopon blochii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, Cape seabream (Pachymetopon blochii) (© Joris van Alphen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB, Slinger (Chrysoblephus puniceus) (© Geoff Spiby)\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective fisheries management has supported the partial recovery of seabream species.\n\nOverfishing has consequences for food security and livelihoods affecting small-scale, recreational and commercial fisheries. The marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers and has substantial yet unquantified impacts on marine biodiversity and other fishery sectors. Recreational fishers compete with small-scale and commercial fisheries, but remain largely unmonitored and ineffectively regulated.\nTo ensure fair and sustainable fisheries that support ocean life and human livelihoods, effective management plans based on scientific evidence should be implemented for all sectors, to manage the impacts on ecosystems, species, genes and people. Fortunately, the number of assessed stocks has grown due to new methods in stock assessment, and South Africa has made progress with ecological risk assessments. The country can expand on this foundation to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Better inclusion of recreational fisheries in policy and planning could reduce sectoral conflict and ensure equitable resource distribution. Key strategies include rebuilding overfished stocks, enhancing monitoring, and ensuring sufficient capacity for Red List and stock assessments. Specific actions should focus on reducing harmful practices, reducing bycatch, regulating (especially online sales/imports) and reducing gill net use, increasing compliance, improving spatial management, preserving genetic diversity, and promoting responsible resource use. Diversifying shark control measures can help reduce fishing pressure on threatened shark, ray, mammal and turtle species. Ensuring policy coherence and aligning monitoring efforts will be essential to manage growing demand and limited marine resources sustainably.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "| The negative impacts of pollution continue to increase in South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems, exceeding sustainable limits and affecting biodiversity, human wellbeing, and economic development (established). South Africa has advanced water policy, however, there is a need to strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement for aquatic ecosystems. |\nSouth Africa’s rivers, wetlands, groundwater, estuaries and marine ecosystems are vital for water and food security, yet are compromised by pollution that contributes to a third of aquatic ecosystem extent being in poor condition. Half of South Africa’s estuaries have moderate to very high levels of pollution. The pollution originates from point and non-point sources, including agricultural return flow, discharge from wastewater treatment works, sanitation distribution networks, unmanaged urban stormwater, and other production and industrial processes. Poor solid waste management, particularly from rural and peri-urban areas upstream or near to water resources, also impacts water quality. Pollution disrupts the functioning of terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, compromising ecosystem services, causing eutrophication and oxygen depletion and local die-off of aquatic species, and often supporting uncontrolled spread of invasive aquatic plants. Emerging pollutants such as microplastics, persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PFAS1) and pharmaceuticals threaten water safety and aquatic biodiversity. Recent studies have detected DDT2 and other organochlorine pesticides in Lake Sibaya, coral reefs and offshore marine ecosystems.\nSouth Africa’s aquatic ecosystems have limited pollution assimilation capacity, which is being exceeded. Contaminated water has public health implications and reduces the availability of clean drinking water, and water of suitable quality for food production and other economic activities. Toxins from pollution accumulate in food chains, affecting both aquatic life and the human communities that depend on ecosystems for food security and livelihoods. These impacts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities who are directly reliant on natural water sources.\nSouth Africa needs to improve management of pollutants, particularly for wastewater, agricultural runoff, urban stormwater and emerging contaminants. With increased demand on water resources and considering the water-food-energy nexus, there is a need for alignment in policy, law and governance for integrated water quality management. Recent achievements include the publishing of the National Water Resource Strategy III in 2023, the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Coastal Marine Waters in 2022, and the Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill in 2025. These recent advances in water policy now require well-resourced action. It is vital to amplify current investment in modernising wastewater treatment works to ensure they meet current and future demands. Innovative urban drainage solutions should be instituted to improve stormwater management. Pollution levels in aquatic ecosystems should be effectively monitored. Water pollution is a complex developmental, economic, social, and environmental issue. Addressing it effectively requires an integrated, participatory approach and collaborative partnerships across all levels of society, including government, the private sector and civil society.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "| Accelerated climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts on biodiversity and people, with increasing irreversible losses and disturbances (well established). Intact and well-managed biodiversity helps people to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Integrated solutions involving biodiversity, society and climate action are key to adapting to climate change. |\n\nClimate change has caused irreversible losses of species and range shifts, as well as changes in ecosystem structure and disturbance regimes in all realms. More than 200 South African species have experienced severe population declines and increased extinction risk due to climate change, such as the iconic halfmens (Pachypodium namaquanum) and Namaqua dune mole rat (Bathyergus janetta). In the South African ocean, climate-driven shifts in prey species’ ranges contribute to a decline in seabird numbers and the worst coral bleaching in history is currently underway. Estuarine fish species (e.g., spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii) have extended their ranges by hundreds of kilometres, changing estuarine food webs. Climate change also amplifies other pressures on biodiversity such as biological invasions, habitat loss, pollution and changes to freshwater flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling up renewable energy is part of South Africa’s Just Energy Transition, and must be accomplished in a way that considers biodiversity. For example, this blade patterning experiment is ongoing at the Umoya wind farm in Hopefield, where painted blades show reduced bird fatalities (© Robert Simmons).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruptive flooding is now a seasonal reality in several provinces due to climate change. In 2022, KwaZulu-Natal experienced extensive flood damage like the Umdloti beachfront in this image. The Palmiet area was less affected thanks to the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project. The project had recruited EnviroChamps from the community to clear alien vegetation along the river and monitor for blockages of sewers and stormwater drains in the two years prior to the 2022 floods. (© Ryan Daly) [Attempting to get Palmiet photo instead] {.underline}\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, climate thresholds have now been reached. The year 2024 was the first on record with a mean temperature more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean. South Africa will likely become drier in the west and have intensified rainfall events in the east, with the interior warming faster than the global terrestrial mean. Biomes will likely change (e.g., Fynbos and Succulent Karoo drier and Savanna more woody), and species extinction risk is likely to increase. Environmental cycles and ecosystem processes that humans depend on are changing. Rising sea levels cause coastal erosion and infrastructure damage; shifting fire regimes impact property and air quality; warmer temperatures threaten water quality through increased eutrophication; and extreme weather events like droughts, heavy rainfalls and strong winds undermine safety and livelihoods.\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy remain important for mitigating climate change. Recognising the connection between climate, biodiversity and society helps to identify additional integrated solutions. Ecosystem-based adaptation is the use of biodiversity to help people adapt to and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Ecological infrastructure, such as wetlands, rivers, estuaries, coastal dunes and kelp forests, helps to protect people and built infrastructure from the impacts of extreme weather events. Well-managed ecological infrastructure can support resilient agricultural production and maintain a steady supply of water. Programmes that maintain and restore ecological infrastructure and ensure connectivity across landscapes and seascapes are cost-effective ways to preserve nature’s adaptive capacity. Investment in inclusive climate action that reduces risk and prioritises equity and justice is essential.",

    "text": "The focus of NBA 2025 was on creating transparent and repeatable workflows hosted on accessible repositories, and ensuring that the entirety of the results expected in the NBA are online via a searchable website. However, there was also substantial new work that was accomplished between the release of NBA 2018 and the release of NBA 2025. The following is what is new in NBA 2025:\n\nExcellent progress has been made regarding automated condition assessments to support the NBA 2025 inland wetlands threat status; NBA 2025 provides interim regional wetland types while a rigorous update of the typology is underway to provide more detailed characterisations; and work towards a revised National Wetland Map remains ongoing using a multi-partner, mixed approach that integrates GIS-based wetland predictive modelling, remote sensing and specialist mapping and validation (both field and desktop).\nRiver condition data (PES) was updated nationally as part of WRC project and this data was used to update and improve river ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe Marine Ecosystem Map Version 2023 is used in this NBA and represents a minor update to the 2018 map, with the reintroduction of a pelagic layer in deeper waters beyond the shelf. In the meantime, a data-driven framework for updating the map has been in development and will represent a more substantial update in time for the next NBA. Condition data was not updated, however assessment methods have been improved.\nVarious research and mapping projects have made new data available on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien plants; these data have been used to improve terrestrial ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe NBA shows trends in terrestrial ecosystem threat status with one of the world’s first applications of the Red List Index for ecosystems (RLIe), showing trends in ecosystem risk. The index can be disaggregated using national biomes or the IUCN Global Ecosystems Typology Level 3 – the latter useful for international comparisons.\nThree new taxonomic groups have been included in NBA 2025: freshwater crabs, Anostraca (fairy shrimps) and spiders, and revised assessments of birds, mammals, reptile and amphibians have improved the Red List Index that tracks changes in threat status over time.\nBuilding on the efforts begun for NBA 2018, the genetic component of the NBA now pilots international indicators of genetic diversity.\nThanks to Statistics South Africa’s 2024 publication Experimental Biodiversity-based Tourism Estimates for South Africa, the updated Biodiversity Tourism statistics are used in the benefits infographic."

    "text": "The NBA is produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) as part of its mandate to report regularly to the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on the status of the country’s biodiversity. SANBI operates through the Network of Partners Model, recognising that such a technically demanding and wide-ranging scientific assessment cannot be achieved without substantial support from numerous partners. This model not only ensures the completion of the NBA, but also fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa. The co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.\nNBA 2025 would not have been possible without the substantial in-kind contributions of time, data and expertise from numerous individuals and institutions. From November 2019 to October 2025 more than 490 individuals from approximately 110 institutions contributed over 23 000 person-days of work. Their dedication and expertise are sincerely appreciated – the NBA truly is a multi-stakeholder endeavour.\nSANBI is particularly grateful for the strategic and long-term partnerships that supported leadership of the Estuarine (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and Coastal (the Institute for Coastal and Marine Research at Nelson Mandela University) Components of the NBA. Their clear and experienced leadership of these complex components was invaluable.\nVarious governance structures guide the NBA, ensuring a broad range of experts and stakeholders contributed to the assessment. We extend our thanks to the members of the various ecosystem committees and species working groups for their technical inputs; the NBA 2025 Core Reference Group for leading the complex content; the internal SANBI Cross Functional Steering Committee for oversight and support; and the Strategic Advisory Committee (consisting of senior officials from various government departments and entities, non-governmental organisations and private sector associations) for cross-sectoral inputs and advice on communicating NBA findings. Appreciation also goes to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment intergovernmental structures where the NBA key messages were tabled for inputs.\nFinally, thanks to all the talented photographers who generously donated their images for use in NBA 2025, both in this publication and on the website. Their contributions greatly enrich the presentation and communication of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity."

    "text": "Why the NBA is done\nThe NBA is the primary tool for monitoring and reporting on the state of biodiversity in South Africa. It is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute’s (SANBI) mandate, in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). The Act specifically states that SANBI ‘must monitor and report regularly to the Minister on (i) the status of the Republic’s biodiversity and (ii) the conservation status of all listed threatened or protected species and listed ecosystems’.\nThe scope of the NBA is broad, assessing biodiversity at the ecosystem and species level, and addressing aspects of genetic diversity. The assessment covers all of South Africa’s territory, across land and sea, including its subantarctic territory of the Prince Edward Islands. Information is organised by realm (terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine (benthic and pelagic)), and the cross-ream coastal zone and the subantarctic region. \nRead more about the purposes and uses of all the NBA products here.",

    "text": "How the NBA is undertaken\nThe breadth and scope of the NBA calls for a major collaborative effort between multiple institutions and individual contributors. There are many ways that individuals become involved in the NBA, from contributing data or providing advice, to helping undertake analyses and being part of the author team. This fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa; and this co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.\nThe vast majority of contributions to the NBA is on a volunteer basis without any financial compensation from SANBI. Without these voluntary contributions from experts and institutions outside of SANBI, the NBA would not be possible.",

Although among the smaller of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries, which together contain more than two-thirds of the world’s biodiversity, South Africa ranks in the global top ten of countries in terms of plant species richness and third for marine species endemism. The country holds three of the world’s 36 recognised biodiversity hotspots, 31 Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance, including the subantarctic Prince Edward Islands) and the Agulhas Bank that is an equivalently unique marine ecosystem (Figure 1). Applying the international standard, South Africa has identified 263 terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), which are sites of global biodiversity significance. This network of KBAs is expected to expand over time as the marine realm is assessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystem facts\nSouth Africa has a wide range of bioclimatic, oceanographic, geological and topographical settings. Together, these support high ecosystem diversity and endemism. Almost 1 000 distinct ecosystem types have been described and for the purposes of the NBA these are grouped into four realms: terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine. The cross-realm coastal zone is made up of selected terrestrial and marine ecosystems and all estuaries, and the Subantarctic is made up of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Prince Edward Islands, 1 700 km south of mainland South Africa.\n\n\n\nTundra vegetation on Marion Island– part of South Africa’s subantarctic territory; waterlogged mires, fern-dominated slopes and coastal salt spray habitats can be seen.

Note the logaritmic scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is rich in species (Figure 2) and is home to an estimated 67 000 animal species, although many invertebrates remain undescribed or undiscovered. The 2025 South African National Plant Checklist records 23 514 taxa and 21 539 species, of which 20 204 are indigenous. Remarkably, 60.5% of these indigenous species are endemic to the country.\nCurrent estimates indicate that South Africa harbours approximately 8% of the world’s non-vascular and 6% vascular plant species; and 10% of the world’s dung beetle, 7% of bird, 6% of bee, 5% of mammal, 3% of reptile, 2% of amphibian and 1% of freshwater fish species. In the marine realm, South Africa supports 15% of the world’s shark, ray and chimaera species, 15% of nudibranch, 13% of marine (bony) fish, and 5% of seaweed (including brown, green and red algae. Several terrestrial invertebrate groups have high richness relative to global statistics, with South Africa hosting nearly 5% of the world’s butterfly, 4% of spider, and 3% of dragonfly and damselfly species.\nTwo-thirds of South Africa’s plant species are endemic, and its cycads represent 10% of the global species count with 92% endemism. Around half of the South African species of amphibians, butterflies, bees, spiders and freshwater fishes are endemic, as are nearly 40% of dung beetle and reptile species. Approximately 30% of seaweed species and 40% of South Africa’s estimated 10 000 marine animal species are endemic, the vast majority being invertebrates.\nMicroorganisms (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, fungi, viruses), an often-overlooked and largely unassessed group, are essential for healthy functioning of natural and agricultural systems in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given the country’s immense diversity of floral and faunal species, and that each species has its own array of microbial species associated with it, it is likely that these are also diverse. For example, it has been estimated that each unique vascular plant species in South Africa is associated with at least seven unique fungal species, implying more than 171 000 fungi species (an underestimate, as fungi associated with invertebrates are not included).\nClick here for more details and a downloadable Factsheet\n\nRecommended citation\nDayaram, A., Van der Colff, D., Mtshali, H., Klopper, R., Le Roux, M., Poole, C., Dlamini, T., Sink, K., Currie, J., Skowno, A., Jones, G., Khatieb, S., Mogajane, K., Hamer, M., Truter, M., Jacobs, A., Venter, F., & Seymour, C. 2025.

    "text": "Benefits of biodiversity\nThe 2018 Compendium of Benefits of Biodiversity describes the how biodiversity provides multiple benefits to the economy, society and human well-being. The sections below contain a summary of key elements of the Compendium, with edits and some recent additional information. SANBI has prepared a series of factsheets on the benefits of biodiversity and links to these are provided within the relevant section:\n\n1. Biodiversity and jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa’s biodiversity provides substantial employment in a range of sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s biodiversity provides substantial employment in a range of sectors. For every one job involved in managing and conserving biodiversity, there are five jobs in economic sectors that depend on biodiversity. This means that continued investment in biodiversity conservation helps to provide sustainable employment, contributing to one of South Africa’s primary national development goals.\nIn a study completed in 2019, it was estimated that jobs directly related to biodiversity totaled approximately 418 000. This was comparable to the number of jobs in the mining sector at the time and represented 2.6% of national employment. There was agreement that this was likely an underestimate, and that further work was needed to fully and correctly estimate biodiversity-related employment. Work is underway with Statistics South Africa on a Biodiversity Economy Satellite Account.\nImportantly, there are jobs dedicated to managing biodiversity and/or maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure (e.g. in protected areas or conservation authorities) and/or research, and for every one of these jobs there are approximately five other jobs that depend on utilising biodiversity – either consumptive or non-consumptive use. These utilisation jobs are in sectors such as fisheries, wildlife ranching, biodiversity tourism, traditional medicine, crop agriculture, biotrade and more.\n\n\n\nHealthy rangelands are vital to both livestock and wildlife ranching, and there are an estimated 245&nbsp000 jobs on these farms across South Africa (©John Power)\n\n\nMany biodiversity-related jobs are outside major urban centres and are labour intensive, contributing to rural development, poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. In a context where employment in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture is declining, biodiversity-related employment is based on a renewable resource that, if appropriately managed, can provide the foundation for long-term economic activity and growing numbers of jobs. This means that efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity should be seen not as a cost to the economy but as an investment in a resource that supports wider economic activity and employment.\nDownload the Biodiversity provides jobs factsheet. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Biodiversity and food security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity is essential for food security\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity plays an important role in commercial agriculture, which supplies food in large quantities to the majority of the population.\nNatural patches that surround farms are the source of pollinators and natural enemies of agricultural pests. Fruit and vegetable crops, which are often pollinated by animals, contain nutrients that are important for health. South Africa is unique in that it uses two indigenous sub-species of bees for pollination, which are far more disease resistant than managed alien honey bees used in other parts of the globe. Natural predators also help to control pests that destroy crops.\nMore than 70% of South African land is used as grazing for livestock or game, sectors that are extremely important to the South African economy because only 11% of our agricultural land is suitable for cultivation.\nIn many parts of South Africa, people rely on foods collected directly from the wild, including 1 300 edible plant species and many edible insect species.\nNumerous coastal communities rely on subsistence fishing for food, and South Africa’s 22 commercial fisheries extract many tonnes of seafood from the ocean annually.\n\n\n\nApproximately 147 coastal communities in South Africa participate in small-scale fishing, and the marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers (©Ryan Daly).\n\n\nIn addition to direct benefits, there are numerous soil, nutrient cycling and water-related ecosystem services that create the necessary environment for productive agriculture and that support the harvesting of wild species for food.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Biodiversity and water security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa is a water scarce country, and healthy rivers and wetlands help to ensure the flow and quality of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) are the 10% of the land area of South Africa, Lesotho and eSwatini that supply 50% of water to these countries. They are a vital form of ecological infrastructure, feeding major dams and providing water that is essential for people and the economy, often in urban centres some distance from the SWSAs themselves. Sound science has been used to delineate SWSAs for surface water and groundwater, and to better understand their contributions and the pressures they face. Securing SWSAs will involve implementing a range of different mechanisms to protect, restore, manage and monitor them. Doing so across this small fraction of land will help to reduce risks to water security now and in the future. The benefits for water security will become even more important as South Africa adapts to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nSWSAs are vital ecological infrastructure for national water security (©Jeremy Shelton).\n\n\nDownload the Strategic Water Source Areas: vital ecological infrastructure for national water security factsheet. \nEcological infrastructure is as important as built infrastructure, especially for climate resilience and adaptation\nEcosystems, climate and human society are all deeply interconnected. Healthy ecosystems act as living infrastructure that provides services such as filtering water, moderating floods, storing carbon, and helping communities adapt to climate change.\nEcological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that generate or deliver valuable services to people, such as freshwater, climate regulation, soil formation and disaster risk reduction. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is just as important for providing services to people and underpinning socio-economic development. Ecological infrastructure includes, for instance, healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. South Africa has abundant ecological infrastructure, providing opportunities to support development and unlock economic potential. Ecological infrastructure’s value is seldom captured in market transactions and we tend to under-invest in it. Some examples of the range of benefits provided by ecological infrastructure to the public are:\n\nSouth Africa is a water scare country, and ecological infrastructure such as healthy catchments, wetlands and riparian areas supports numerous water-related ecosystem services, including regulating the flow and quality of water;\necological infrastructure on the coast, such as dunes and kelp forests, provides protection of built infrastructure from natural hazards;\nestuaries are vital ecological infrastructure for food security, as they provide a nursery function for important fish species;\necological infrastructure, like wetlands, rivers and their catchments, coastal dunes and healthy rangelands, help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change (known as Ecosystem-based Adaptation); and can help to protect communities from the impacts of extreme weather events, and make the provision of food and water more resilient to changes in climate.\n\nMaintaining functional ecological infrastructure in strategically important areas will secure and improve various ecosystem services important to South Africans, enhancing investments in built infrastructure, complimenting national parks and protected areas, supporting rural development, job creation and job security, and supporting water and food security. Maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure are cost-effective ways to lessen the impacts of climate change on society and the economy.\nDownload the 2023 Ecological infrastructure for climate change adaptation factsheet. \nDownload the 2013 Ecological infrastructure factsheet. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. The biodiversity economy and innovations from biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has a growing wildlife economy based on indigenous mammals and our unique flora.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are an estimated 10 000 wildlife ranches that engage in a range of commercial activities such as ecotourism, intensive game breeding, live game sales, trophy hunting and biltong hunting. Game meat and biltong are produced from 21 different species. The most recent estimates (2015) show that the economic contribution of the sector may be as much as R14.4 billion, directly providing 65 000 jobs. The fact that wildlife can be private or communal property has resulted in stable or increasing large mammal populations in South Africa. This industry relies heavily on biodiversity, and wildlife ranching is a vitally important land use for both socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. However, it can have negative impacts on biodiversity if conducted too intensively.\n\n\n\nFencing in wildife ranches allows for intensive management but carries an environmental cost (© John Power).\n\n\nA 2015 survey found that there are 549 retail products that contain South African indigenous plant resources and/or bee products from just 24 South African species. There is likely large potential for growth in the bioprospecting sector, with potential for more retail products that make use of resources from indigenous species.\nSouth Africa’s flora is world-renown and supplies important horticultural gems to the world. For example, our indigenous Strelitzia reginae (bird of paradise) flower was crowned the flower of Los Angeles in 1952. Species of the Cape flora, especially, rank among the world’s favourites. Breeders have invested huge effort and expertise towards the production of new and exciting ornamental and cut flower selections. Species and hybrids of South African genera that are in high demand are: Agapanthus, Arctotis, Crocosmia, Disa, Eucomis, Erica, Haemanthus, Ixia, Lachenalia, Leucadendron, Leucospermum, Lobelia, Mimetes, Nerine, Nymphaea, Ornithogalum, Osteospermum, Pelargonium, Protea, Rhodohypoxis, Serruria, Sparaxis, Strelitzia, Streptocarpus, Tulbaghia, Venidium, Watsonia and Zantedeschia. Many of South Africa’s indigenous plants are still awaiting research to unlock their full potential and maximise the opportunities offered by our exceptionally rich floral wealth to ensure that local people benefit from this potentially valuable resource.\nSouth Africa has a list of 1 593 taxa (species, subspecies and varieties), and 220 of these are priority indigenous taxa, that are important relatives of commercial crops around the world. These crop wild relatives are a vital resource of genetic material that can be used in plant breeding to enhance crop production. Several areas around South Africa have been identified as important areas for crop wild relative richness.\nBiomimicry is the process of learning from nature and emulating its forms and processes in engineered situations. Several biomimicry solutions have been gleaned from South African species, such as tougher ceramics based on the strong structure of abalone shells, wind turbine design based on whale flippers, and architectural cooling based on termite mounds.\nDownload the The Biodiversity Economy Project factsheet. This project was initiated in 2022 to expand protected areas across the country, while also ensuring that the communities located within and around these areas will reap the benefits associated with their local biodiversity. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Biodiversity and tourism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTourism is a large and growing contributor to the South African economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country’s striking natural scenery and rich biodiversity are popular drawcards, with beaches, coral reefs, kelp forests, mountains and wildlife some of the top tourism attractions. Biodiversity tourism is tourism that involves the use or enjoyment of biodiversity. In 2019, domestic and international biodiversity visitors collectively spent R60.6 billion in South Africa, providing 91 836 jobs. Protecting South Africa’s wealth of biodiversity assets will safeguard one of the country’s most competitive tourism advantages, and ensure that biodiversity tourism can increasingly create revenue and jobs\n\n\n\nIn 2019 biodiversity tourism contributed R27.7 billion to GDP (© John Power).\n\n\nDownload Biodiversity is a tourism asset factsheet. \n\n\n\n\n\n6. Biodiversity and health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExperiencing nature has mental and physical health benefits and is important for South African’s everyday wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies show that natural green spaces can improve the mental health of urban residents, and an active outdoor lifestyle can promote physical wellness. Natural areas in cities can help filter out air pollution and reduce urban heat effects.\nThere are approximately 2 000 medicinal plant species in South Africa, and around 656 are commonly-traded. Remedies that use medicinal plants are based on centuries of cultural practice and indigenous and knowledge. The traditional medicine sector operates in parallel with allopathic medicine. Synthesising work undertaken in 2018 (a report done for SANBI title ‘Understanding the diverse economic value of medicinal plants to the South African economy’) revealed the following:\n\nTraditional medicines are used by 70% of South Africa’s people, are essential to the work of some 200 000 Traditional Health Practitioners and provide a further ~93 000 income generating activities in the informal sector for harvesters and traders.\nIt is estimated that the informal African Traditional Medicine (ATM) industry is valued at about R18 billion per year.\nAs much as 40 000 tonnes of medicinal plant raw material are traded per year in the informal sector.\n\nIncreases in volumes traded are having a negative impact of the threat status of a number of species – the Red List assessments from 2024 show that 143 medicinal plant species are threatened (14 Critically Endangered species, 44 Endangered, and 85 Vulnerable), and a further 69 species are of conservation concern (e.g. Near Threatened, Rare or Data Deficient).\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Biodiversity and cultural or spiritual practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many South African societies, people believe in a vital spiritual or cultural connection with an animal, plant or place. There is increasing evidence that interacting with nature brings measurable emotional and mental benefits to people as well as physical benefits, and that a decline in this interaction can cause deficits. Natural spaces and indigenous species have huge value and significance to South Africans no matter whether we live in an urban or rural environment. Biodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life, as well as a role in our enjoyment of life.\n\n\n\nNatural places are important for various cultural and spiritual practices (© Peter Chadwick).\n\n\nOur natural ecosystems, plants and animals have influenced our evolution and cultural and spiritual development. These influences are woven into languages and place names, as well as the religion and folklore supporting spiritual and cultural life. This web of associations with biodiversity forms an important part of South Africans’ national identity.\nSpecies with cultural or spiritual significance include Tulbaghia violaceace, Cymbopogon validus, Bucorvus leadbeateri and Lamprophis fuiginosus among many others.\nThere are some exceptional natural areas in South Africa that are associated with cultural and spiritual beliefs and are considered sacred sites. Examples include Mapungubwe Hill, Table Mountain, Gompo’s Rock and Lake Fundudzi. These sites, which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance, are a vital part of connecting communities to their heritage, and hold potential as other effective area-based conservation measures if they are not already under some form of protection.\nBiodiversity also provides opportunities for education (outdoor classrooms) and for ordinary citizens to contribute to biodiversity science across the country through citizen science initiatives.",

    "text": "The various products of the NBA\nThe NBA’s products can be summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInput datasets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA has a strong focus on presenting spatial information (e.g. maps of ecosystem types, maps of ecological condition, species distribution maps, maps of threat status and protection level, etc.), and also makes non-spatial datasets available (e.g. species checklists). Each of these datasets are accompanied by their metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWorkflows for analyses and indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nA key focus of NBA 2025 was to ensure that the workflows for undertaking these analyses were published on repositories such as GitHub. This ensures that the NBA analyses are reproducible and mitigates any loss of knowledge or data should there be a change in staff undertaking the analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteResults of analyses\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of NBA analyses are usually indicators or other metrics, dispalyed as graphs or maps. These are all made available for users, with a recommended citation. Workflows and analytical code and documentation are available in various repositories (e.g. GitHub), technical reports are (available through FigShare, Dryad or similar, or SANBIs institutional document library - OPUS) and through publised scientific articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key messages distill some of the most important findings of the NBA in a way that is accessible to various audiences. Each key message includes a summary paragraph with a confidence statement. The messages draw on evidence from an NBA analysis (e.g. Red List status, ecological condition); describe why this is important (e.g. what are the consequences for people); and give some practical actions, responses and interventions that can be done. The key messages should be considered with their underlying data and analyses to inform sector-specific strategies and action plans, cross-sectoral planning and interventions, research strategies, scenario planning, and other action plans or response strategies that may be co-produced subsequent to the NBA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFacts and statistics about the benefits of biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the seven goals of the NBA is to highlight the benefits of biodiversity for people and the economy. There is a chapter on the ‘importance of South Africa’s biodiversity’ and each key message contains some information on why the finding is important. Links to additional information about nature’s contributions to people are also provided throughout the NBA website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePriority actions, responses and interventions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA indicators reveal potential avenues through which pressures on biodiversity can be reduced and biodiversity conservation outcomes and sustainable resource management may be improved. Each key message in the NBA makes a ‘call to action’ that addresses the finding and identifies specific interventions that could be considered. Through this process, the NBA contributes to the body of knowledge that enables the multitude of stakeholders to co-develop, through participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, the various policy responses and detailed action and implementation plans required for the benefit of both biodiversity and people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummaries\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch via surveys, consultations and a systematic review after NBA 2018 revealed that few users want a full printed synthesis book and that most users want to search for exactly what they are interested in. The move to the online website with regular updates is accommodating user needs. However, the value of a shorter less-technical printed booklet is still recognised for several reasons – including: it is a tangible product for high-level officials to showcase at a launch function; it provides media personnel with a colourful summary that may entice them into exploring certain NBA results more deeply; it serves to entice new users of the NBA into exploring the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePopular products\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other popular products are created from NBA results, and may depend on the audience – e.g. press releases, films, pre-recorded PowerPoint presentations, fact sheets, social media posts, conference presentations, popular articles, etc. Some of these items form part of the NBA Communication Plan, which is aimed for immediately pre- and post- the NBA release event, and are produced by SANBI and its NBA partners. However, all users of the NBA are welcome and encouraged to create their own popular products - making use of the results in ways that are meaningful for their particular audience.",

Biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services to support people and the economy. Strengthening collaborative, biodiversity-inclusive planning is essential to safeguard South Africa’s natural capital while enabling development. |\n\nAcross the country’s landscapes and seascapes, habitat loss, fragmentation and declining ecological function are reducing the capacity of natural systems to deliver crucial services. On land, habitat loss is primarily driven by expanding human settlements and the establishment of new croplands, with over 100 000ha lost annually between 1990 and 2022. Encouragingly, the rate of loss shows signs of slowing since 2014. In the freshwater and estuarine realms, direct habitat loss from, for example, mining, croplands and housing developments, is a major pressure on aquatic biodiversity, alongside flow reduction and pollution. Direct habitat loss from mining and energy generation is relatively limited compared to other forms of land use (&lt;1% of land in South Africa), but intense, persistent and cumulative impacts often extend beyond the direct footprint, especially in aquatic realms where effects cannot be easily contained. In the marine realm, there are substantial direct impacts on biodiversity from coastal and offshore mining, and oil and gas extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand mining is as escalating pressure on the South African coast and in estuaries, impacting coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services. (© Jacque Smit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed land use, ensuring corridors for biodiversity, is possible in South Africa’s production landscapes. (© Endangered Wildlife Trust)\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment on land and in the sea is crucial for economic growth to address the country’s social challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. When these developments are positioned appropriately and managed sustainably, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation can be prevented. Healthy ecosystems are the foundation for South Africa’s social, economic, and environmental wellbeing. They provide essential services to sustain life and livelihoods such as clean water, food security, climate regulation and disaster risk reduction.\nSouth Africa has a strong foundation for systematic biodiversity planning and supportive legislation, but implementation gaps remain. Action is urgently needed to better integrate biodiversity into spatial planning and decision-making at all levels of government and across all sectors. Development decisions should be informed by the best available science and local knowledge, ensuring that future land- and sea-uses align with ecological sustainability. Strategic Environmental Assessments, updated environmental guidelines (such as the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline), and enhanced cross-sector coordination are required to manage cumulative impacts to safeguard species and ecosystems. By strengthening participatory, integrated, biodiversity-inclusive planning, and embedding biodiversity considerations into all development processes, South Africa can balance economic growth with the protection of its natural capital, securing the ecosystem services that are needed to support current and future generations.",

New alien species arrive every year and those present in the country continue to spread and cause negative impacts. Better planning and monitoring are required to ensure effectiveness of interventions aimed at managing biological invasions for the benefit of biodiversity, people and the economy. | \n\nSince 2018, South Africa has detected around three new alien species per year. Invasive species continue to spread and are found throughout the country. The national survey of invasive plants showed that coverage of selected invasive species increased by 10.6% between 2008 and 2023. Recent estimates indicate that 17% of terrestrial ecosystem types show greater than 10% cover by invasive alien plants. Biological invasions contribute to the listing of 31% of threatened terrestrial ecosystems, and 36% of all threatened species. \nInvasive alien species are having increasing impacts on nature, water security, people and the economy. Studies show that biological invasions use 3–5% of South Africa’s precious surface water runoff each year, which is a direct threat to water security in a water-scarce country. They also reduce the value of livestock production from natural rangelands by R340 million per year, impacting both food security and livelihoods.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s third national The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa (2022) report provides important information and recommended actions.© SANBI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive species, such as the black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) pictured here, are found across the country, impacting many Strategic Water Source Areas. Efforts to improve water security by clearing alien plants in catchments are ongoing at various scales, For example, the efforts of the Greater Cape Town Water Fund has resulted in clearing of more than 46 000 ha of invasive trees in five years (2018-2023), with an estimated recovery of over 15.2 billion litres of water per year. © Tsamaelo Malebu\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge of the distributions of alien plants has increased through the national survey, as well as through citizen science and the digitisation of historical records. Biological invasions have also been successfully managed in some cases, including through biological control, with positive returns on investment. Successful eradication includes the estuarine cordgrass (Sporobolus alterniflorus) from the Great Brak Estuary and the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from the Rondegat River. Prevention is crucial, through management of introduction pathways, particularly in marine systems where eradication is often unfeasible. Finalisation of the Ballast Water Management Bill is essential to preventing marine introductions. The establishment of the Border Management Authority aims to improve the prevention of illegal and accidental introductions. Management plans with clear goals and consistent monitoring will improve the effectiveness of invasive species control. Several global and national initiatives provide a framework for managing invasive species. These include the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 6) and the Invasive Alien Species Assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. At a national level, South Africa is guided by the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa’s Biodiversity and the draft National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan. With judicious investment and integrated governance, the impact of biological invasions on South African society can be reduced and any potential benefits researched and optimised.",

Interventions that increase revenue within the conservation sector and contribute meaningfully to local livelihoods are required. | \n\nSouth Africa’s rich biodiversity, combined with socio-economic challenges, has led to increasing illegal trade of numerous high value species in all realms. Around 9 500 southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum; Near Threatened) were poached between 2010 and 2023. Tens of thousands of plants of South Africa’s 37 cycad species (Encephalartos spp.), 71% of which are threatened, have been illegally harvested from wild populations in the last three decades – even from protected areas. A lack of effective guardianship of Endangered South African abalone (Haliotis midae) has seen an estimated 90% reduction in abundance over the past 35 years. The West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) has changed from Least Concern to Endangered largely because of illegal fishing. Official seizures and analyses of online trade show that reptiles, medicinal plants, seahorses, pipefish, sea cucumbers, marine gastropods (cowries, cone-shells, etc.), fish maw (swim bladders) and live ornamental aquarium species (including sharks, rays and corals), are being targeted. Some illegal harvesting methods (e.g., the use of gill nets for illegal fishing) are indiscriminate, affecting non-target species as well.\n\n\n\nMore than 1.1 million succulent plants have been confiscated from poachers between 2020 and 2025, representing only an estimated 15% of the total poaching underway. This flyer promotes how conscientious consumers can differentiate between cultivated and wild-collected plants. (© SANBI).\n\n\nSince 2020, illegal harvesting of ornamental succulent and geophytic plants, in high demand in Europe and Asia, has seen a dramatic escalation in the Succulent Karoo Biome where range-restricted endemic plant species are easily accessible and local people have limited livelihood opportunities. Over 1.1 million harvested plants have been confiscated, 632 species populations are in decline, and the populations of 12 endemic species have been reduced to functional extinction.\nAddressing illegal wildlife trade through conventional law enforcement, focussed on stringent legislative measures such as trade prohibitions, is failing. For example, despite substantial enforcement, policy and management efforts directed towards curbing the poaching of rhinos, many have been killed within state-owned protected areas, leaving the private sector with the responsibility of protecting just over half the national herd. Similarly, 96 million South African abalone have been poached in 10 years, despite a severely reduced catch limit for the legal fishery. Many of the comprehensive response strategies and management plans, particularly for cycads and succulents, are severely under-resourced and poorly implemented, while conservation agencies lack resources for effective compliance measures.\n\n\n\nThe use of innovative technologies can contribute to a sustainable biodiversity economy through legal wildlife trade. Shown here are 3D-printed examples of shark fins provided by TRAFFIC to help customs officials at border points, with a QR code link providing additional support for identification. (© TRAFFIC)\n\n\nContributing to a sustainable biodiversity economy through legal trade offers a new frontier for addressing wildlife crime by supplying persistent demand whilst directly tackling socio-economic challenges and generating funds for conservation. Molecular techniques, such as DNA and stable isotope forensics, as well as the use of artificial intelligence, 3D printing and other accessible digital technologies that improve monitoring, training and databasing, provide innovative technological solutions for ensuring that trade is well-regulated and does not threaten wild populations.",

    "text": "| South Africa has recorded a marked rise in extinction risk for species over the past decade, with the international headline indicator, the Red List Index of species, showing accelerating declines (established). A whole-of-society approach is required for recovery efforts to meet national and international responsibilities. |\n\nSouth Africa’s most threatened taxonomic groups are freshwater fishes, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) and succulent plants. Up to 66% of freshwater fish taxa are threatened, due to invasive alien fish and habitat modification. Other plants, reptiles, birds and mammals are also showing increased rates of decline over the past decade. More than 100 species have moved from Least Concern to threatened categories on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2018. The main cause has been population reductions linked to climate change (see key message A1) in the western parts of the country impacted by severe drought. The worst impacted region is northern Namaqualand, where endemic plants, beach macrofauna and reptiles have also experienced declines as a result of expanding mining activities. The increase in illegal trade has caused severe declines to species in use (see key message A6), including endemic plants, some marine invertebrates, and sharks and rays. Estuarine degradation, fishing and lethal shark control measures contribute to the threat status of cartilaginous fishes. The decline in sharks and rays is a global trend, yet with several endemic species, South Africa has a responsibility to protect them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) and green sawfish (P zijsron), were once common along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and in estuaries, but are now considered Critically Endangered within our waters. Building on progress, South Africa can further diversify and modernise shark management measures to improve marine species status without unduly increasing risks to bathers. (© Dennis King)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 55 plant species endemic to the Richtersveld region have been uplisted to highly threatened categories since NBA 2018 due to the combined impacts of climate change and rapidly expanding mining activities. All three species of tree aloes found in the Richtersveld, including this quivertree (Aloidendron dichotomum, Vunerable), were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2022 as threatened as a result of population declines due to climate change. (© Wendy Foden)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe threatened status of several nearshore marine species is of concern for food and livelihood security (see key message A5), as is the status of other species harvested for food and medicine. Species support crop agriculture, the wildlife economy, tourism and many other jobs. South Africa is a megadiverse nation and has committed to global efforts to address the species extinction crisis. Target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for a concerted effort to halt human induced extinction of threatened species and for the recovery and conservation of species.\nSouth Africa has many conservation tools available for species recovery. Sufficient resourcing is required to ensure Red List assessments are conducted and updated for all taxonomic groups at least every 10 years. Additional species information needs to be included in the National Environmental Screening Tool, particularly for the marine realm, and in Spatial Development Frameworks and Integrated Development Plans. In cases where species have experienced extreme losses and recovery is required, multiple partners need to work together. South Africa’s Centre for Species Survival and the IUCN National Species Specialist Group have developed and costed recovery plans that estimate a 10-fold increase in spending on species recovery is required for South Africa to meet its obligation under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Expanding protected and conserved areas and improving their effectiveness for under protected and threatened species remains crucial to safeguard South Africa’s rich species diversity (See key message B4).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "| The first assessment of genetic health based on two international indicators suggests declines in the genetic diversity of South Africa’s species (established but incomplete). More South African taxa need to be assessed to better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, and genetic richness analyses need to be incorporated into protected area expansion strategies. | \n\nThe Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 4) uses the proportion of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 (Ne 500 indicator) to assess genetic health. Ne represents the number of breeding individuals in a population. When Ne is above 500, populations are large enough to sustain genetic diversity. Populations below this threshold lose genetic diversity, increasing their risk of extinction. An initial assessment of 126 species from various taxonomic groups in South Africa, across different ecosystems and threat levels, found an Ne 500 score of 0.42, meaning that 58% of assessed populations are below the threshold, suggesting substantial genetic erosion. These populations are smaller than is necessary to ensure their long-term persistence and the overall adaptive potential of the species. Alarmingly, even Least Concern and Near Threatened species showed poor genetic indicators, suggesting undetected genetic decline not captured by extinction risk assessments. Similar trends have been seen globally. A complementary indicator tracks the proportion of species’ populations still present (PM indicator). South Africa scored 0.95, suggesting that most populations of the assessed species have not yet disappeared. This offers hope that with effective management, the genetic health of South Africa’s species can still be recovered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) (© Tim Kuiper)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea) (© Endangered Wildlife Trust)\n\n\n\n\n\nA, the grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) (© Tim Kuiper) and B, the brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea) (© Endangered Wildlife Trust) are both categorised as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, yet their genetic population size (Ne) may already fall below the threshold for long-term survival. Falling below the threshold of Ne &gt; 500 raises concerns about species’ abilities to maintain genetic health and adapt to environmental change. \n\nGenetic diversity underpins a species ability to adapt to environmental changes. Low genetic diversity increases extinction risk, especially under pressures such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, inbreeding, hybridisation, unsustainable use and poorly managed translocations. Safeguarding evolutionarily distinctive species will enable adaptive potential to be maintained within an ever-changing environment. \nTo better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, efforts are underway to assess complete taxonomic groups. Increased investment is needed in genetic monitoring (i.e., comparing genetic metrics at multiple time points) to acquire more precise estimates of genetic indicators. Additional indicators based on phylogenetic diversity (e.g., the EDGE index – evolutionarily distinct, globally endangered; and the Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity indicator) are being piloted, and are important for ensuring that evolutionarily distinctive species are protected. Importantly, environmental impact assessments and spatial planning should integrate landscape-level genetic richness, particularly for threatened species, by using genetic data or their proxies in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, in systematic biodiversity planning and for strengthening the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy.",

Restoration and recovery programmes, that are guided by science, implemented collaboratively and properly monitored are essential to ensure lasting benefits for both people and nature. | \n\nMore than half of South African ecosystems are in poor ecological condition. A particularly high proportion of wetland (51%), river (75%), estuarine (82%) and coastal (48%) ecosystem extent is Moderately to Critically Modified. Species also suffer from multiple pressures, including unsustainable use, poaching or other impacts from human activities (e.g., pollution).\n\n\n\nIt is vital that ecosystem restoration and species recovery programmes are designed scientifically, and then evaluated for their effectiveness so that future programmes are cost-effective and have the best possible results for people and biodiversity. Species recovery projects may involve costly translocation efforts – here some leopards are checked before their relocation (© North West Department of Economic Development, Environment, Conservation & Tourism).\n\n\nOften, the ecosystems and species that are most useful to people are those whose condition deteriorates the most. Wetland and river ecosystems provide people with essential water, and estuarine and coastal ecosystems are widely used for recreation, fishing and settlements. These ecosystems begin to lose their ability to provide these vital services as their condition deteriorates. In the same way, species that are used for harvesting or trade are susceptible to unsustainable use that threatens the resource. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 2) calls for 30% of degraded ecosystems to be under effective restoration by 2030 in order to enhance ecological integrity and recover the benefits people receive from ecosystems. Target 4 calls for the recovery and conservation of species, in particular threatened species. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification also sets targets to avoid and slow degradation, and restore degraded lands to a natural, productive state (also part of the Sustainable Development Goals).  \nPreventing species decline or ecosystem degradation should always be the primary focus. However, species recovery and ecosystem restoration programmes can be effective interventions when done in a responsible and scientifically sound manner. Prioritising where such initiatives should occur can ensure cost-effectiveness and lasting positive impacts for both people and biodiversity. Several recent initiatives focus on using spatial biodiversity data to scientifically plan restoration initiatives. For example, the National Coastal and Marine Spatial Biodiversity Plan has been used to identify strategic priorities for restoration in coastal and marine ecosystems, and South Africa’s Essential Life Support Action Areas map identified areas that should be prioritised for restoration on land. These efforts reiterate the value of spatial biodiversity information, such as the NBA threat status and protection level analyses, in supporting national priorities and actions. Species recovery initiatives should be equally well planned, as it is estimated that investments exceeding R1 billion are needed over the next five years to recover species under severe threat in South Africa (see key message B1). Monitoring and evaluating (see key message C2) of ecosystem restoration and species recovery interventions is crucial yet often neglected. Counterfactual impact evaluation and a national information system for restoration and recovery programmes are both essential for adaptive management, improving future projects and reporting meaningfully. Restoration and recovery should always be a collaborative effort, involving indigenous knowledge and a whole-of-society approach to future-proof programmes with diverse stakeholder expertise.",

It directly supports decision-makers in identifying emerging issues of concern and adjusting management actions to address these. The collation of data from various field-based monitoring efforts supports reporting on the status of biodiversity at the provincial, national and international scales. Strengthening monitoring mechanisms and coordination will be crucial for driving accountability, transparency, and learning through the revised National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). A robust national biodiversity monitoring framework can play a pivotal role, and its success will depend on: i) the extent to which national indicators comprehensively reflect the goals and targets of both the NBSAP and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; ii) the degree to which the three spheres of government, non-state actors, and other stakeholders actively adopt and apply the national monitoring system in planning and reporting; and iii) the accessibility and openness of biodiversity data and metadata ensuring that information is shared widely, used meaningfully, and contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of South Africa’s biodiversity. \nBiodiversity monitoring can be advanced by investment in innovative technology and data science. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, are particularly useful for unobtrusively monitoring vast, inaccessible areas. Artificial intelligence can process and analyse large volumes of data to identify subtle changes in real-time, allowing for more proactive responses to emerging pressures. Biodiversity monitoring should also align with global best practices and build on existing international monitoring initiatives. Partnering with international institutions and initiatives will enable enhanced technical support, harmonised data collection standards, access to advanced technologies, and invaluable insights into the creation of data processing workflows. Monitoring should continue to harness the value of citizen science, which reduces data collection costs while increasing the scale of data collection. Citizen science has the added benefit of empowering individuals to contribute to conservation efforts and strengthening community involvement in addressing global challenges like climate change. Citizen science programmes require constant fund raising and awareness building, and coordinated campaigns to secure these efforts are essential.\n\n\n\nThe Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers (CREW) Programme has a dedicated network of citizen scientists who upload observations to iNaturalist.

Protected areas are vital for ecological sustainability and climate-change adaptation. They also serve as the backbone of the ecological infrastructure network, protecting the areas that deliver important ecosystem services to people.\nEPL is calculated using protected areas, recognised under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003)2. The Act provides for several categories of protected areas, including Special Nature Reserves, National Parks, Nature Reserves, Marine Protected Areas, and Protected Environments. In addition, it also recognises World Heritage Core Sites, especially Protected Forest Areas, and Mountain Catchment Areas. The EPL indicator does include a narrow range of legally secure Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) as contributing to meeting protection targets (Figure 1) and, as additional OECMs are evaluated and mapped across the country they will be considered in the computation of the indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "The trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI). The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1 and, the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction, i.e., if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The RLI is calculated only for comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups or groups where a representative sample has been selected. Changes in status over time has been tracked for 13 taxonomic groups (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The Red List Index (RLI) for taxonomic groups assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time, e.g., note the sharp decline in sharks, birds, mammals and plants. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). The newly assessed group Anostraca (fairy shrimps) are threatened by degradation to ephemeral wetlands. *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the protection level is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nIncreases in extinction risk is evident for most groups, but a marked increase in rate of extinction since the last assessment is evident from the change in angle of declines for reptiles, birds, mammals and plants (Figure 1). Increases in threat status for birds has largely been due to freshwater birds impacted by increasing levels of pollution and other forms of habitat degradation, while the main drivers of declines for mammals, plants and reptiles have been climate change and loss of habitat for mining and renewable energy developments. Most plants that have been uplisted due to increasing levels of extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape (Figure 2). The province was severely impacted by the drought over the past decade, and is experiencing ongoing pressure from mining and renewable energy developments. The two groups at highest risk of extinction are freshwater fishes and cartilaginous fishes. Sharks, rays and chimaeras are included on South Africa’s RLI for the first time, with the majority having wide ranges that extend outside South African territory. Many of these cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, have slow growth and low reproductive output, and many are declining across their ranges due to overfishing (including from recreational fisheries and as bycatch from industrial fisheries), lethal bather protection measures and habitat degradation. Half of South Africa’s freshwater fishes are endemic, with many concentrated in Western Cape river systems. While only due for reassessment in 2026, the declining status of rivers and dwindling resources available for management actions where many of these species are concentrated likely means that they will continue on a declining trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The density of species (per km2) that have increased in threat status since NBA 2018, for plants (A), terrestrial and freshwater animals (B) and marine animals (including sharks, sparids and marine birds only)(C). Plants in the Northern Cape’s Namaqualand region are under the most severe pressure from climate change related drought, mining and succulent poaching, while the impacts on terrestrial and freshwater animals are widespread but linked to areas with high habitat loss and degradation. In the marine realm, increased risk to species is attributed to multiple pressures with coastal mining, estuarine degradation, flow reduction, overfishing and lethal shark control measures contributing to worsening species threat status.",

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status is an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact or alternatively losing vital aspects of their structure, function or composition. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the end point for ecosystem decline. For NBA 2025 the RLE framework was applied across all realms, where in previous NBAs the South African threat status framework (developed prior to the IUCN RLE) was applied for some realms. Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more about the indicator here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Number of ecosystem types in each threat status category in each realm (A); the percentage extent of each ecosystem in each threat status category (B) (note for that length is used for rivers, while area is used for all other realms). In addition to the realms, the plot also shows results for the coastal zone, made up of estuaries and selected marine and terrestrial types, and the subantarctic territory of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nWetland, river and estuarine ecosystems are threatened, with over half of the ecosystem types and ecosystem extent of rivers and wetlands listed as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable; while for estuaries these figures are over 75% (Figure 1). This reflects the poor ecological condition of wetland, river and estuarine ecosystems that are overwhelmed by a variety of compounding pressures, particularly, increasing disruptions to the hydrological regime and deteriorating water quality, with fishing being an additional pressure in estuaries. Similarly high levels of pressure are evident on the coast, with 71% of ecosystem types being threatened, comprising almost half of the coastal extent. In contrast, a relatively large proportion of marine and terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as Least Concern. This is in part due to the relatively low pressure on some ecosystem types (e.g., abyssal or remote mountain ecosystem types) and due to inadequate data on pressures in utilised ecosystem types (e.g., marine pelagic fishing and grazing pressures in the rangelands).

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status is an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact or alternatively losing vital aspects of their structure, function or composition. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the end point for ecosystem decline. For NBA 2025 the RLE framework was applied across all realms, where in previous NBAs the South African threat status framework (developed prior to the IUCN RLE) was applied for some realms. Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more about the indicator here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Number of ecosystem types in each threat status category in each realm (A); the percentage extent of each ecosystem in each threat status category (B) (note for that length is used for rivers, while area is used for all other realms). In addition to the realms, the plot also shows results for the coastal zone, made up of estuaries and selected marine and terrestrial types, and the subantarctic territory of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nWetland, river and estuarine ecosystems are threatened, with over half of the ecosystem types and ecosystem extent of rivers and wetlands listed as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable; while for estuaries these figures are over 75% (Figure 1). This reflects the poor ecological condition of wetland, river and estuarine ecosystems that are overwhelmed by a variety of compounding pressures, particularly, increasing disruptions to the hydrological regime and deteriorating water quality, with fishing being an additional pressure in estuaries. Similarly high levels of pressure are evident on the coast, with 71% of ecosystem types being threatened, comprising almost half of the coastal extent. In contrast, a relatively large proportion of marine and terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as Least Concern. This is in part due to the relatively low pressure on some ecosystem types (e.g., abyssal or remote mountain ecosystem types) and due to inadequate data on pressures in utilised ecosystem types (e.g., marine pelagic fishing and grazing pressures in the rangelands). Ecosystem assessments are updated periodically, and new information and methods of measuring risk of ecosystem collapse will inform future assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. The indicator was developed in South Africa and has been used as a headline indicator in national reporting since 2005. Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined targets ranging from 16 to 32% (linked to the extent and condition of types within protected areas). Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about the indicator here.\nWetlands and rivers have the lowest overall protection levels of any realm, with over 80% of ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected (referred to as under protected) (Figure 3). This is driven in part by the poor ecosystem condition of some freshwater ecosystems (only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem targets). A high proportion of estuarine ecosystem types have some level of protection, but very few are considered Well Protected. Protecting estuaries is challenging, given the range of pressures that can impact them directly and their upstream catchment areas. Marine protection improved dramatically in 2018/2019 with the declaration of 20 new Marine Protected Areas – this translates into higher levels of protection within the marine realm when compared to the terrestrial realm. The marine realm has a small number of large ecosystem types that are under protected and this results in a difference between the percentage of types in each category (Figure 3) and the extent of each category (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Number of ecosystem types in each protection level category in each realm (A), the percentage extent in each category in each realm (B) (for rivers length is used as the unit of extent, for all other realms area is used). In addition to the realms the plot also shows results for the coastal zone, made up of estuaries and selected marine and terrestrial types, and the subantarctic territory of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial patterns of protection level reflect the geography of the protected area network: terrestrial ecosystem types around large national parks (e.g., Kruger National Park in the northeast of the country) are Well Protected (Figure 4 A). Under-protected regions on the mainland include the grasslands of the Free State and interior of the Eastern Cape, and the Nama Karoo. Other gaps in the protected area network are evident in the offshore eastern portion of the marine realm, the southern Eastern Cape coast and the Northern Cape coast (Figure 4 A, B). Most coastal ecosystem types are represented in protected areas, although only a quarter of the extent is Well or Moderately Protected. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area in South Africa’s subantarctic territory provides protection to most ecosystem types, with almost half the types being Well Protected, however, these comprise a small portion of the territory (Figure 4 E).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Spatial distribution of ecosystem protection level for each realm: (A) terrestrial and marine benthic; (B) estuarine and marine pelagic; (C) river; (D) wetland; (E) subantarctic territory including the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding seas.

    "text": "Intersecting threat status and protection level\nThe headline indicators of the NBA provide information on the pressures faced by species and ecosystems and on the progress made in protecting them. Combing the indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of South Africa’s biodiversity.\nThe outputs of spatially explicit ecosystem assessments, as conducted in the NBA, can provide an initial indication of priority ecosystem types by intersecting the results of ecosystem threat status and protection level. Ecosystem types that are highly threatened (Critically Endangered or Endangered) but under protected (Not Protected or Poorly Protected) can be considered to be in urgent need of conservation action (Figure 5). Priority ecosystem types could need additional protection, focussed management intervention or could be restoration priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Highly threatened and under protected ecosystems of the marine and terrestrial realms (other realms not visible at this scale).\n\n\n\n\nIn the marine realm, 17% (27/163) of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge and parts of the Kwazulu-Natal Bight.\nA quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types (115/463) are highly threatened and under protected. The Fynbos Biome and Namaqualand contain many Critically Endangered and under-protected ecosystem types while the grasslands of the interior and the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt have many Endangered and under-protected types.\nOver a third of river ecosystem types (82/222) and a third of wetland types (29/82) are highly threatened and under protected. Lowland river ecosystem types and depression wetlands have the highest proportion of types in this combined threat and protection category.\nA third of estuarine ecosystem types (7/22) are highly threatened and under protected. Each of the four biogeographical regions have ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under protected.\nFor the coast, over a third of ecosystem types (68/190) are highly threatened and under protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The unique lowland renosterveld vegetation of the Overberg is highly threatened and under protected, and home to dozens of endemic plant and animal species.

    "text": "Ecological condition across realms\nEcological condition is estimated using a range of different approaches across the realms, but is essentially the product of spatially representing the various pressures exerted on biodiversity. Ecological condition in the terrestrial realm relies primarily on land cover change, invasive species and overgrazing data; cumulative pressure mapping is used in the marine realm; and a multi-criteria ecological condition framework is used in the estuarine and freshwater realms. The different systems were aligned as far as possible in the NBA to allow for cross-realm comparisons of ecosystem condition and unified terminology.\nThe marine and terrestrial realms are similar in terms of their relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (~70%). In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact (Figure 3). For example, the Cape lowlands have extensive winter field crops while the mountainous areas of the Cape see far less intensive agriculture; all bay ecosystem types, the shelf edge and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight are subject to multiple pressures while many deep-sea ecosystems beyond the shelf have yet to see extensive modification.\nIn stark contrast, freshwater wetlands and rivers, as well as estuaries, are predominantly heavily modified, and in poor ecological condition. These realms are geographically constrained, and pressures tend to concentrate. Only 19% of estuarine area, 49% of wetland area and 25% of river length are considered to be in natural/near-natural condition. Coastal biodiversity is also under particularly high pressure and less than half of the ecologically determined coastal zone remains in a natural/near-natural condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

This table summarises the progress that has been made, highlighting the gaps that still remain:\n\n\n\nPriority from NBA 2018\nSummary of progress since NBA 2018\n\n\nBiotic and abiotic monitoring\nLong-term, focused, site-based monitoring of biodiversity and pressures on biodiversity, as well as the monitoring of specific species at larger scales (e.g., harvested species, invasive alien species, etc.) remain insufficient. While there are some long-term site-based and species monitoring programmes, many suffer from a lack of resources. Abiotic information (e.g., water turbidity, sediments, temperature, pesticide load, microplastics, etc.) is crucial for mapping ecosystems and their condition, and much of this information is not collected and/or poorly understood in terms of their impacts on ecological condition. Further investment in strategic monitoring and data systems is needed. See also key message C2.\n\n\nIncorporating genetic diversity measures\nThere is ongoing progress on emerging genetic diversity indicators (see the genetic diversity indicators section), however the species and taxonomic groups included in these indicators are a small sample and coverage needs to be expanded.\n\n\nTaxonomic coverage and taxonomists\nWhile some progress has been made through projects that focus on foundational biodiversity information for certain taxonomic groups (e.g., the SeaMap and REFRESH projects have addressed some gaps in marine and freshwater invertebrates respectively), many invertebrate taxonomic groups suffer from a lack of information (descriptions, life history, taxonomic review, etc.), expertise, and diminishing capacity in collections facilities. Across many other taxonomic groups there is still a need to revitalise taxonomic efforts for species descriptions and to build capacity amongst taxonomists.\n\n\nImproved classification of ecosystem types and an integrated ecosystem classification system\nEach realm continues to make steady progress in ecosystem classification and mapping, with regular cycles of updates and version releases. The first edition of the South African National Ecosystem Classification System Handbook was published by SANBI in 2021. The mapping and classification of South Africa’s aquatic systems, especially riparian areas, wetlands and the deep sea, remain a challenge due to limited foundational data and ground-truthing.\n\n\nMeasuring and mapping ecological condition and pressures data\nEcological condition data underpins our ability to assess the risk of collapse of ecosystems. Since the NBA 2018, new data on invasive alien plant species density and distribution have enhanced our RLE assessments on land, and focussed research on rangeland condition is starting to bear fruit – though comprehensive data sets will only be finalised in 2026-2027. Climate change models have improved and inform species assessments, and will be used in future ecosystem assessments. Marine pressure data are outdated and limits reliable condition assessment in the marine realm. Recently, extensive ecological modelling work has resulted in comprehensive wetland health data. The automated WET-Health 2.0 links seamlessly to the widely used field assessment methodology, and allows broad assumptions to be drawn on which driving component (hydrology, water quality, vegetation or geomorphology) is most impacted per wetland, each wetland buffer and the wetland’s receiving catchment. More work is required on microplastics, pesticides and other pollutants in order for such data to be useful in ecosystem and species assessments\n\n\nMapping and assessing ecological infrastructure\nMapping has advanced for water-related ecological infrastructure (Strategic Water Source Areas, wetlands and rivers) within two large demonstration catchments. Advances have also been made in the terrestrial and marine realms, though much work remains.\n\n\nIndicators linking biodiversity and human wellbeing\nNBA 2018 showcased several facts and statistics via the Compendium of Benefits of Biodiversity. Unfortunately few of these have been updated. The Multidimensional Biodiversity Index Project (2022-2024) piloted a composite indicator for South Africa. It consists of two sub-indices, the Biodiversity Index (BI) that focuses on the state of biodiversity; and the Biodiversity Contributions to People Index (BCPI) that assesses how biodiversity supports human wellbeing through regulation, material provision and non-material benefits. Funding is needed for future steps for the MBI, including further development of BCPI indicators.\n\n\nMonitoring effectiveness of interventions and responses\nThere are good examples of indicators being developed to monitor the effectiveness of actions and responses to pressures on biodiversity (e.g., The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa is a regular report using various important indicators; and case studies have evaluated the effectiveness of maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas and threatened ecosystem regulations in certain biomes/provinces) (von Standen et al., 2022). More work is needed, ideally using counter-factual impact evaluation methods, to monitor the impact of interventions, especially restoration/recovery interventions. See also key message B5.\n\n\nData management and sharing\nSANBI has made some progress on a national biodiversity information system (Biodiversity Advisor)) which aims to enhance South Africa’s open access approach to biodiversity information, through allowing users to search seamlessly across multiple sources of information. SANBI has also undertaken substantial capacity development for the skills needed to streamline and automate indicator calculation and produce dashboards. The upcoming National Biodiversity Monitoring System aims to provide dashboards of key biodiversity indicators, underpinned by transparent workflows and databases. The move to an online NBA enables more regular updating of certain NBA indicators.",

Since the NBA 2018, new data on invasive alien plant species density and distribution have enhanced our RLE assessments on land, and focussed research on rangeland condition is starting to bear fruit – though comprehensive data sets will only be finalised in 2026-2027. Climate change models have improved and inform species assessments, and will be used in future ecosystem assessments. Marine pressure data are outdated and limits reliable condition assessment in the marine realm. Recently, extensive ecological modelling work has resulted in comprehensive wetland health data. The automated WET-Health 2.0 links seamlessly to the widely used field assessment methodology, and allows broad assumptions to be drawn on which driving component (hydrology, water quality, vegetation or geomorphology) is most impacted per wetland, each wetland buffer and the wetland’s receiving catchment. More work is required on microplastics, pesticides and other pollutants in order for such data to be useful in ecosystem and species assessments\n\n\nMapping and assessing ecological infrastructure\nMapping has advanced for water-related ecological infrastructure (Strategic Water Source Areas, wetlands and rivers) within two large demonstration catchments. Advances have also been made in the terrestrial and marine realms, though much work remains.\n\n\nIndicators linking biodiversity and human wellbeing\nNBA 2018 showcased several facts and statistics via the Compendium of Benefits of Biodiversity. Unfortunately few of these have been updated. The Multidimensional Biodiversity Index Project (2022-2024) piloted a composite indicator for South Africa. It consists of two sub-indices, the Biodiversity Index (BI) that focuses on the state of biodiversity; and the Biodiversity Contributions to People Index (BCPI) that assesses how biodiversity supports human wellbeing through regulation, material provision and non-material benefits. Funding is needed for future steps for the MBI, including further development of BCPI indicators.\n\n\nMonitoring effectiveness of interventions and responses\nThere are good examples of indicators being developed to monitor the effectiveness of actions and responses to pressures on biodiversity (e.g., The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa is a regular report using various important indicators; and case studies have evaluated the effectiveness of maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas and threatened ecosystem regulations in certain biomes/provinces) (von Standen et al., 2022). More work is needed, ideally using counter-factual impact evaluation methods, to monitor the impact of interventions, especially restoration/recovery interventions. See also key message B5.\n\n\nData management and sharing\nSANBI has made some progress on a national biodiversity information system (Biodiversity Advisor)) which aims to enhance South Africa’s open access approach to biodiversity information, through allowing users to search seamlessly across multiple sources of information. SANBI has also undertaken substantial capacity development for the skills needed to streamline and automate indicator calculation and produce dashboards. The upcoming National Biodiversity Monitoring System aims to provide dashboards of key biodiversity indicators, underpinned by transparent workflows and databases. The move to an online NBA enables more regular updating of certain NBA indicators.",

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level results\nEcosystem protection level measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined ecosystem targets (ranging from 16 to 32%)1,2. Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about this indicator on the About ecosystem protection level page.\nOver three-quarters (76%) of South Africa’s 463 terrestrial ecosystems received some form of statutory protection. However, levels of protection vary widely; 121 ecosystems are Well Protected, 67 are Moderately Protected, 163 are Poorly Protected and 112 are Not Protected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This expansion reflects the declaration of new protected areas primarily through biodiversity stewardship programs. Other effective area based conservation measures (OECMs) have not yet been fully assessed and mapped in South Africa and it is likely that the Protected and Conserved Areas estate (including both PAs and OECMs) covers substantially more than 10% of the landmass (Key Message B4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Protected Areas in the Terrestrial realm circa 2024\n\n\n\n\nBiome and provincial level results\nAt a biome level, most Well Protected ecosystems are concentrated in the Fynbos (38) and Savanna (27). The very large National Parks (Khalahari Gemsbok and Kruger) in the Savanna Biome and the extensive Provincial Protected Areas and Mountain Catchment Areas in the Fynbos Biome mean that protection targets for numerous ecosystem types are met or exceeded. The Forest Biome, which has a limited natural extent in South Africa, is Well Protected, in part due to regulations related tot he National Forests Act4 and cultural practices. In contrast lowland Fynbos, grassland and Karoo ecosystems tend to be under protected (Poorly Protected or Not Protected) (Figure 3) reflecting the need to improve their representation in the protected area network (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Protection level map of terrestrial ecosystem types. The inset graph shows the percentage of ecosystem types that fall within each protection category.\n\n\n\nEcosystem protection patterns at the provincial scale largely mirror those observed at the biome level. The Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape contain the highest numbers of under-represented ecosystems within the protected area network (Figure 3), many of which overlap with the Cape Floristic Region, a globally recognised biodiversity hotspot with exceptionally high ecosystem diversity. In contrast, provinces such as Gauteng and Limpopo, which have fewer ecosystems overall, still exhibit a high proportion of under-protected ecosystems (Figure 2), highlighting persistent gaps in representation even where total ecosystem numbers are lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nTerrestrial ecosystem protection level was calculated by assessing the degree to which protected areas targets for each ecosystem were met. Land cover, invasive alien plant data, terrestrial ecosystem maps (vegetation map) and protected areas maps for 2018 and 2024 were cross tabulated, allowing the calculation for each ecosystem type: i) the full extent of the type ii) the full extent of the type within the PA network, iii) natural remaining the extent of the type within the PA network (including invaded areas), iv) the extent of invasion by alien plants within the PA network for each type.\nThe extent of of each type within the PA network was adjusted for habitat loss and invasion. The natural remaining extent within the PA network was adjusted downwards by subtracting 70% of the invaded extent within the PA network. This step ensures that effectiveness of PA network is accounted for to a degree by preventing areas heavily degraded by invasive alien plants from fully contributing to ecosystem representation targets.\nEcosystem protection level index (EPLI) calculation (Harris et al., in review) is based on the concept of the Red List Index of Species and tracks changes in protection categories between time points (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.

Distribution of threatened marine species in the marine realm of South Africa, including sharks, sparids, birds, mammals and reptiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nThe number of South African marine species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria is 497 (check) through a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Of these, approximately 36% (update) (was 18% in 2018) of taxa are threatened. However, this is not representative of the actual proportion of taxa threatened as there has been a focus on assessing economically important species and species at risk with few comprehensively assessed marine taxonomic groups leading to an inflation of threatened taxa. Species assessments in the marine realm are limited by capacity shortfalls, gaps in taxonomic knowledge, and the lack of information on species distribution, life histories and long-term population trends has resulted in high levels of data deficiency. Marine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency across all realms signalling the need to address knowledge gaps and increase capacity for marine species red listing.\nAssessments for sharks, rays and chimaeras were conducted for the first time with cartilaginous fishes emerging as the most threatened group with 41% being threatened (link to bird page).\nMany of the shark and ray species are wide ranging and much of their declines can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other regions, however 42% of South Africa’s endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened, indicating that the country has an important role in reversing declines of these charismatic predators. Many cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, have slow growth and low reproductive output, and many are declining across their ranges due to overfishing including from recreational fisheries and as bycatch from industrial fisheries, lethal bather protection measures and habitat degradation.\nA re-assessment of South Africa’s seabreams show 10 (24%) of the 42 assessed seabreams are threatened with 2 Critically Endangered, 4 Endangered and 4 Vulnerable species. Of South Africa’s 6 marine reptiles, four of six species are threatened with turtles at risk from fisheries bycatch or incidental mortalities. Seabirds…..(Alistair and Newi). Eight of 51 marine mammals are threatened (16%) with the Indian ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea being of local concern. The primary threat is the lethal shark control measures with pollution, coastal development and shipping also contributing to pressure on this species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Conservation status of the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin (Sousa plumbea)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of fishing (as incidental bycatch) of Endangered Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin (Sousa plumbea) are exacerbated by shipping, pollution and coastal development due to its shallow water habit (Plön et al. 2016). Developments in estuaries and the alteration or loss of rocky shores, both critical habitat for the Indian Ocean Humpback dolphin, affect this species both directly and indirectly (Barros and Cockcroft 1999, Jefferson et al. 2009, Plön et al. 2011). Recent research has shown that the population size of this species is possibly much smaller (500 individuals) than the 1000 individual population size used during its 2016 IUCN Red List Assessment (Vermeulen et al. 2017). The development of a National Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) aimed at ensuring the long‐term survival of the species in South Africa is strongly recommended. National and international collaboration will need to be strengthened to ensure a thorough assessment of the species’ conservation status within and beyond the border of South Africa (Vermeulen et al. 2017).\n\n\n\nDue to poor taxonomic knowledge and a paucity of occurrence records, most marine invertebrates cannot be assessed – however, a small sample of utilised marine invertebrates (10 spiny lobster and abalone) found that 3 of 11 species are threatened . Among the 20 coastal invertebrates that have been assessed are x sandy beach macrofauna which are the first beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species globally. Of these, 4 (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further 3 (15%) are Near Threatened. The pressures on coastal invertebrates are mainly mining on the West Coast, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp from the shore.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Current legal quotas of only 96 tons is now allowed annually. The legal commercial fishery, managed through Total Allowable Catch allocations across seven zones in the Western Cape, has been systematically undermined and overwhelmed by industrial-scale illegal fishing operations. Organized criminal gangs, linked to international drug trafficking, have exploited this species at catastrophic levels, with illegal harvests estimated at over 2,000 tons annually compared to the tiny legal quotas. Population surveys reveal widespread recruitment failure throughout all commercial zones, as illegal fishing targets predominantly immature individuals below the legal minimum size, preventing reproduction and causing population densities to fall below levels necessary for successful breeding. The assessment projects continued steep decline in spawning biomass through 2035, with recovery possible only through a 59% reduction in poaching combined with robust enforcement measures.\n\n\n\nJasus lalandii\n\n Jasus lalandii, the West Coast Rock Lobster, has become more threatened and uplisted from Least Concerned to Endangered in 2025, primarily due to severe population decline, with exploitable biomass falling by 68% over the past three generations (45 years) and current stock levels at only 1.2% of pre-fished levels from 1910. The species faces overwhelming pressure from illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is estimated to remove more than twice as much biomass annually as legal fishing operations. Total Allowable Catch quotas have been reduced by 91% from over 5,000 tonnes in the late 1970s to just 505 tonnes in 2024/2025, reflecting the resource’s dire condition. Environmental stresses have compounded fishing pressures, including significant reductions in somatic growth rates since the 1990s, mass strandings caused by low oxygen events (with an estimated 2,000 tonnes lost in the 1997 “walkout” alone), and an eastward distribution shift that has disrupted traditional fishing areas. Climate change effects, including increased frequency of algal blooms and hypoxic conditions, continue to threaten the species through habitat degradation and physiological stress. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is slow-growing with a 15-year generation length and complex life cycle including an extended larval stage. Despite decades of management measures including minimum size limits, seasonal restrictions, and operational management procedures, the combination of heavy fishing pressure and environmental changes has pushed this economically important species to the brink of collapse\n\n\n\nPalinurus gilchristi\n\n Palinurus gilchristi, the South Coast Rock Lobster, has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2025 primarily due to historical overexploitation that caused significant population declines over the past three generations (48 years). The species’ exploitable biomass has declined by 35% since the 1977/1978 fishing season, with current stock assessments indicating spawning biomass is at only 41% of pre-fished levels. A major contributing factor was illegal overharvesting by one company between 1987-2001, which significantly exceeded fishing quotas and caused concurrent drops in both biomass and catch rates across all three fishing areas. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is long-lived (up to 30 years), slow-growing, and doesn’t reach sexual maturity until around 10 years of age. While improved management measures including reduced quotas, effort controls, and vessel number restrictions have led to some recovery in recent years, the cumulative decline over three generations still qualifies the species for Vulnerable status under IUCN criteria\n\n\n\nDonax serra\n\n Donax serra, the White Mussel, is listed as Endangered primarily due to severe population declines of 50-80% over the past decade, as evidenced by commercial fishery data showing catch per unit effort more than halving and approximately 80% reduction in total catch in South Africa. The species faces multiple compounding threats, with commercial and recreational harvesting being the primary driver, particularly after management changes in 2007 that switched from total allowable catch limits to effort-based regulations, leading to reported harvests increasing from around 50,000 individuals annually in the 1990s-2000s to over 1-1.45 million per year after 2007/2008. Mining activities, which affect about 20-25% of the species’ range, cause significant habitat degradation by changing beach sand grain size through tailings deposits, making the sediment too coarse for the clams to burrow effectively and essentially eliminating them from affected sites. Resurveyed beaches show dramatic declines, with abundance at four sites near Plettenberg Bay dropping to only 24-48% of 1980s levels, and anecdotal reports from both Namibia and South Africa describe former abundance hotspots where the species is now extremely difficult to find. The species is particularly vulnerable because it is restricted to specific fine-sand beach habitats and has limited dispersal ability despite having pelagic larvae, making recovery from local population crashes difficult when combined with the ongoing multiple stressors across its range.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends (RLI)\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs). The RLIs is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct.\nAdd further details discussing the findings in detail, improvements, deteriorations, a table can be added of taxa that have had genuine increase/decrease in status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The Red List Index (RLI) for marine species including birds, mammals, reptiles, sharks and sparids assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.

Key pressures on South Africa’s threatened marine species based on x taxa. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme. The size of the bubbles indicates the relative importance of each pressure class. (currently missing marine turtle data)\n\n\n\n\n\nA meta-analysis of the key pressures impacting on taxa of conservation concern revealed that fishing remains the greatest pressure on marine species. Key additional pressures include pollution (plastics, underwater noise, waste water and effluent) and freshwater flow reduction, while key threats include climate change and marine alien and invasive species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4.

    "text": "Red List status and trends\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s flora shows very high levels of species diversity and endemism: 13,642 of the 20,248 taxa (67%), with high concentration in the Fynbos biome.\n1 in 5 endemic taxa are threatened.\nTrends in species status over time were assessed using a representative sample of 900 plant taxa, revealing an increase in extinction risks. Plants threatened with extinction increased by 2% between 2017 and 2024.\nPlant taxa are experiencing a severe crisis, driven mainly by habitat loss and further intensified by invasive species, overexploitation/illegal harvesting and by the intensifying impacts of climate change.\nProtected area expansion has improved plant protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Concentration of threatened species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nSouth Africa has assessed the threat status of 20,248 indigenous plant species using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species categories and criteria, which reflect a species’ risk of extinction. The Red List includes several extinct categories, three threatened categories - Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) - as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD), and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range- restricted endemic species with a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km² that occur in areas with no significant anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are prioritized for national conservation interventions, even if they qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system. \nAmong assessed taxa, 0.2% (36) are extinct or possibly extinct, and 15% (3,195) are threatened. The country also has high endemism, with 13,648 taxa (67%) found only in South Africa. \nGiven this exceptional diversity and high levels of threat, monitoring all species is not practical. To track trends in extinction risk and identify the pressures driving these risks, a representative sample of 900 plant taxa was used. Of the assessed sample taxa, 17% taxa are threatened with extinction (Figure 3 C).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Threat status of South African plant taxa, here represented by a representative sample of 900 plant species; categories follow the IUCN 3.1 Red List Categories and Criteria with an additional national category of Rare added for range-restricted, localised endemics that are not declining. The portion of species in each category is shown in the larger circle, and the proportion of endemic species per category is shown in the smaller circle. The total number of taxa that have been assessed is shown in the inner circle. A) shows the threat status for all taxa; (B) shows the status for South African endemics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The RLIs is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of plants is calculated using a sample of 900 plant taxa.  \nAn increase in extinction risk is evident for plant taxa occurring in the Desert and Succulent Karoo biomes (Figure 4). Rising threat levels for plants have largely been driven by climate change and habitat loss caused by mining and renewable energy developments. Most of the plants that have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape. The province has been severely affected by drought over the past decade and continues to face pressure from mining and renewable energy developments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The Red List Index (RLI) for plant taxa assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. The distribution of plant species that have increased in threat status since NBA 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Conservation interventions for medicinal plants reversing extinction risk trends (Warbrugia salutaris)\n\n\n\n\n\nA pioneering conservation model developed in the Kruger National Park and spread to other parts of South Africa, has successfully resulted in the highly popular medicinal plant the pepper bark tree being downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable. The conservation intervention that supplies traditional healers with cultivated plants to grow in home gardens, has reduced pressure on wild populations while ensuring continued access to culturally important resources. The intervention has slowed and reversed the species’ decline, leading to a genuine improvement in its Red List status. Building on this success, the model is now being expanded to other medicinal plant species, offering a replicable blueprint for balancing cultural practices with biodiversity conservation. https://redlist.sanbi.org/species.php?species=925-2\n \n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nSpecies in terrestrial ecosystems face pressures from habitat loss, invasive alien species, pollution, resource use, and climate change. Habitat loss is the single biggest cause of biodiversity decline, mainly from conversion of natural vegetation for croplands, mining, plantations, settlements, and infrastructure. Habitat fragmentation further affects ecological functioning and the viability of species, especially under climate change and biological invasions.\nThe increasing extinction risk for plant taxa is a result of multiple pressures, with a shift in the most significant drivers. Previously, the primary threats were identified as competition from invasive plant species, crop cultivation, urban development, and livestock overgrazing However, recent analysis highlights a growing influence of climate change and habitat loss due to mining and renewable energy developments. This trend is particularly evident in the Northern Cape province, where most plants that have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk. The province was severely impacted by drought over the past decade and continues to face pressure from mining and renewable energy developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Key pressures on South Africa’s plant taxa, based on a representative sample of 900 plant taxa. This bar chart shows the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened plant species. Pressures are categorized using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and are ranked from most to least frequent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. llegal trade in succulent plants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2019, a total of 878 South Africa succulent, caudiform and geophytic plant species have been illegally removed from the wild as part of a growing trade in ornamental plants facilitated through online trade platforms such as EBay, Facebook and Instagram. SANBI and the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries are co-ordinating the implementation of the National Response Strategy and Action Plant to address the illegal trade in succulent plants",

Recovery work on plants\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 3000 plants threatened with extinction, multiple interventions to address threatened species declines are required including the expansion of protected areas, the restoration of habitats that are being degraded by invasive species, and the inclusion of threatened plants in biodiversity sector plans. In addition, 293, critically endangered and endangered plants need active recovery projects to take place in order toensure that they do not go extinct in the next decade. Between 2020 and 2023 the South African National Biodiversity Institute has run a process to prioritise plants in urgent need of recovery using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria to select those in most urgent need of recovery. A species recovery working group with conservation agencies and indigenous plant growers has been established and each stakeholder has been allocated a handful of species to implement recovery work on. A major upscaling of resources to support species recovery is required as only 14 of the 293 species that require recovery have active recovery projects being implemented. If you would like to financially support the recovery of a critically endangered plant species from extinction please email. i.Ebrahim@sanbi.org.za",

    "text": "Areas of high cumulative pressures and poor ecological condition have been identified, particularly along the southwest Atlantic shelf edge and in the inner shelf of much of the western Cape, parts of the south coast and shelf and several areas in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight (Figure 1). The ecological condition map for the marine realm was not updated for the 2025 NBA although some pressure updates have been underway. The first ground-truthing of marine ecosystem condition shows that pressure mapping is an effective proxy at broad national scales, but that finer scale pressure mapping can improve condition estimates. Increased monitoring is needed to support more accurate assessments of ecological condition (Link to KMC2).\nFigure 1. Map of marine condition\nLike the terrestrial realm, the marine realm has a relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (~x%). In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact.\nPort photo?\nMining photo?\nMining, coastal development, trawling and mariculture have the highest impact scores among the 31 pressures included in the and led to poor ecological condition in some areas. Fishing is the greatest cause of degradation in the offshore environment, whereas coastal development and fishing are the greatest drivers of poor condition in inshore ecosystems. Flow reduction, waster water discharge and lethal shark control measures also drive poor condition in some areas.\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which increase access for fishing, alter shorelines and circulation, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. Port and harbour location therefore warrants careful consideration. Areas of poor ecological condition include parts of the southwest Atlantic shelf edge and the inner shelf of much of the western Cape, and parts of the south coast and shelf and KwaZulu-Natal Bight (Figure 1).\nRestored flows, improved bycatch and waste water management and further reductions of lethal shark control measures could improve ecological condition in parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight.\nImproved bycatch management, and … measures to protect bathers from sharks using non-lethal measures could help improve ecosystem condition in KwaZulu-Natal.",

In the marine realm, a total of 31 mapped pressure layers were used to assess ecological condition (Sink et al. 2018 threat chapter) using an ecosystem pressure matrix. The ecosystem pressure matrix was developed using expert scoring supported by literature and the synthesis of information regarding the impacts of marine pressures (link to pressure section). A guided group consensus method was used to score “functional impact” and “recovery”, simplified from an existing method (Teck et al. (2010) for each pressure and Ecosystem Functional Group. Impact scores reflect the equal weighted average of the functional impact and recovery scores for different broad ecosystem groups per pressure. Condition of an ecosystem at a site (30 x30 m pixels) was classified based on the cumulative impact scores at that site.\nSeverity Extent Very severely modified(&gt;90) Heavily /Severely modified (70-90) Moderately modified degraded (&gt;50)\n&gt;90% CR EN VU\n&gt;70% EN VU\n&gt;50% VU",

Advances in ecological effectiveness are evident but there are gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity and governance. Increasing extent of protection alone is not enough to advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected, the condition of marine ecosystems in conservation areas also needs to be improved. Diversified conservation measures can help address gaps and provide new opportunities to safeguard both biodiversity and cultural heritage. South Africa needs to better include people in the design, implementation and co-management of conservation areas.\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystem Protection Level results\nOf South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, 83% (representing 53.9% of the mainland marine area) are represented in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network to some extent, leaving 27 ecosystem types (17%) as Not Protected (representing 46.1% of the mainland marine area). However, while majority of ecosystems now have some protection only 32 ecosystem types (20%), representing 1.4% of the mainland marine area, are Well Protected. It should be noted that changes in relation to the previous assessment1 do not reflect genuine changes in Ecosystem Protection Level, but are due to revised targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa.\nSouth Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the Phakisa MPA network. Of the 83 ecosystem types that were Not Protected before 2019, 67 types received their first protection in 2019 with the proclamation of 20 new or expanded MPAs2. These included 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types. Additionally, 18 ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected in 2019, going from a total of 9% to 20%. Since 2019 there has been no further progress in protection. However, new work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective Conservation Measures which may help diversify protection models3 .\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (Figure 3). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), gaps in representation will persist. However, while protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves and coastal areas, it should be noted that the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened.\nIncreasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement through collaborative efforts to more effectively mitigate pressures. Strengthened ecosystem management in protected areas can provide an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected.\nEcosystem types that are Not Protected include the Kingklip Koppies, the vast Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope, the expansive Southwest Indian Lower Slope and four pelagic ecosystem types. Among the latter, the Agulhas Retroflection and Southern Ocean Transitional Water is of particular interest as a globally unique area. The uThukela Canyon, the Cape Lower Canyon and St Helena Bay are also Not Protected.\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons cut into the continental slope off South Africa’s western margin. The Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope and the Cape Lower Canyon are both Not Protected ecosystem types. Coastal communities and small-scale fishers can contribute to offshore protection in South Africa and must be included in participatory processes to support new offshore protection measures © SANBI.\n\n\nOf the 27 Poorly Protected ecosystem types, several fall into this category largely because of high levels of ecosystem modification within protected areas, rather than limited area within protected areas. Among others, these include Agulhas and Cape Kelp Forests and two bay ecosystem types (Cape Bay and False and Walker Bay). Other ecosystem types that could advance from their current Poorly Protected status to Moderately Protected through improved ecological condition include Agulhas Mid Shelf Reef, the Agulhas Coarse Sediment Shelf Edge and Amathole Lace Corals.\n\n\n\nAn excellent area to improve protection of the Poorly Protected Eastern Agulhas Outer Shelf Mosaic is in the Seaview Horse Mussel Seabed Management Area near Gqeberha. This area has high biodiversity and Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys found clumps of horse mussels that were not observed in areas with more inshore trawling activity © ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink.\n\n\nForty-eight marine ecosystem types are Moderately Protected. While several of these could advance to Well Protected through improved ecological condition, 27 types will require increased coverage in MPAs or OECMs. For example Agulhas Boulder Shore, Agulhas Rocky Plateau and Agulhas Upper Canyon can improve their Ecosystem Protection Level with increased representation in South Africa’s marine conservation estate.\n\n\n\nAgulhas Upper Canyon requires increased representation in South Africa’s network of protected and conserved areas to advance to Well Protected © Lloyd Edwards and ACEP Deep Secrets and Deep Forests projects.\n\n\nOnly 20% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types are Well Protected, due in large part to poor ecological condition within protected areas. Well Protected ecosystem types include many from the Delagoa ecoregion where the iSimangaliso MPA and World Heritage Site provides protection to many ecosystem types. Other examples of Well Protected types include Agulhas Inner Shelf Reef, Natal Exposed Rocky Shore and seamount ecosystem types in the South east Atlantic.\n\n\n\nDelagoa Upper Canyon, which is home to at least 39 individual coelacanths, is a Well Protected ecosystem type. © ACEP Deep Connections, K.

South Africa’s MPA network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, South Africa had 25 coastal MPAs covering less than 0.6% (6 (51 477 km2)260 km2) of the ocean around South Africa, up from 0.4% (4 (51 477 km2)711 km2) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly in 2019 and covers 5.4% (51 477 km2) of the ocean around South Africa. A map of the 41 MPAs around mainland South Africa is shown in Figure 4, noting that the Prince Edward Island MPA in South Africa’s subantarctic territory is the biggest of the South African MPAs and lies more than 1 700 km south of Gqeberha. No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019. Learn more about South Africa’s MPAs.\nNo marine areas have been recognised as OECMs in South Africa as of December 2025. These areas are governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity values, whether or not biodiversity conservation is the primary management objective.\n\n\nMPA effectiveness\nSouth Africa has made progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of its MPAs4–6. These studies reveal gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity, cultural heritage protection and governance, amongst other attributes, which limit the ecological gains and effectiveness of the MPA network.\nCommon elements in these evaluations indicate a need to revisit MPA objectives for many MPAs, advance efforts to address historical injustices, strengthen social inclusion and collaboration in the design, implementation and management of protected areas and increase socio-economic research. Innovative transdisciplinary strategies in the co-design of protected and conserved areas and transparent and fair trade-offs in planning are needed7. This will ensure equitable governance and increased tangible benefits for rights holders, knowledge holders and people affected by protected areas4. Closer co-operation with fisheries, heritage and tourism could also deliver more integrated and effective protection7.\n\n\nOECMs\nThe concept of OECMs offers new opportunities for more inclusive and people-centred approaches to marine conservation that can encourage and support resource co-management, diverse cultural values, livelihoods and enhanced sustainability, while reducing the burden on MPA expansion in South Africa4.\nExploratory assessments of various management measures that exist in the marine realm allowed for the identification of measures that hold most promise for OECM recognition. These included a marine buffer zone of a biosphere reserve, closed fishing areas adjacent to African penguin colonies, and estuarine management plans. Going forward, it may be strategic to prioritise sites under the above measures for formal assessment against OECM criteria.\n\n\n\nRemotely Operated Vehicle surveys within the trawl closure off Cape St Francis suggest that this area meets the OECM criterion for high biodiversity value. This site, if recognised as an OECM, could contribute to improved Ecosystem Protection Level for the Endangered and Moderately Protected Eastern Agulhas Bay. © ACEP Deep Forests, K Sink\n\n\nThere are certain measures that South Africa’s legislation makes provision for but are yet to be implemented, which could meet the criteria for OECM recognition, depending on where and how they are implemented. An example is special management areas under the National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act. Sites under this measure can be designated primarily for cultural purposes and could potentially constitute OECMs that uphold cultural sustainability, promote the connection of people with their environment and heritage, and facilitate greater inclusivity in marine conservation and management in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Cuturally Significant Areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Sites such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation relevance and recognition as OECMs in partnership with value holders. © Kerry Sink\n\n\nNew research8 has supported progress in identifying and characterising cultural heritage sites in Marine Spatial Planning and coastal management. Eight categories of Culturally Significant Areas were identified drawing from literature, orature and expert knowledge8. These cover tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage, including iconic seascapes, traditional fishing grounds, sites of spiritual and ceremonial importance and oral tradition. Spatial management in alignment with OECM criteria could help to safeguard the deep and diverse cultural ties many South Africans have to the coastal and marine environment. The establishment of small scale fishing zones, a provision under the Marine Living Resources Act, could also be explored as a mechanism for OECM recognition, providing protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding marine ecosystems and cultural heritage9.\nImproving marine ecosystem protection requires strategic collaborative expansion of protected and conserved areas, but also actions to improve ecosystem condition and compliance in existing MPAs, including management and restorative justice steps.",

Schematic to show steps in determining marine Ecosystem Protection Level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history and approach to the development of South Africa’s protection level assessment is provided on the Ecosystem Protection Level explainer page and will soon be published [Harris et al. (in review)]. The 2025 Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets (Figure 5). While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% marine target with an additional rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target for all ecosystem types. When calculating the percentage of area within an MPA, the area contributions were scaled by condition to account for the fact that areas of high modification do not contribute to an ecosystem’s protection level as much as areas of natural condition. The areas were scaled in alignment with the IUCN RLE criteria C and D degrees of modification10. Further, in order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify for the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nChanges in EPL between 2018 and 2025 are caused by the increased target and improved methodology rather than genuine changes in protection or ecological condition. Note that OECMs will contribute to Ecosystem Protection Level once these have been recognised in the marine realm3,9.\nRecent evaluations of ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness for existing MPAs were synthesised to distill key findings beyond the spatial analysis of Ecosystem Protection Level. Synergies in underlying themes related to effectiveness and in recommendations to improve effectiveness or the evaluation thereof were identified. An analysis of stakeholder comments that was undertaken to inform future MPA expansion efforts was also consulted10 and the work undertaken through the iAtlantic project2, Mission Atlantic project10, the Aliwal Shoal Working Group [Aliwal Shoal Working Group 2024], and SeaPeople were additional key informants2,10,11 (Sink et al. 2023 a,b, Sink et al. 2024) , , (Van der Bank et al. 2025). Inputs from three workshops that discussed the draft results of the 2025 marine assessment and co-developed recommended priority actions, also provided useful insights11–13.",

    "text": "Of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types, 27 (17%) are both highly threatened and under-protected. Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through MPA expansion or other spatial management measures that could be recognised as Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs). In addition to expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, reduced fishing pressure and improved ecosystem management.\nFigure 1. Threatened and under-protected benthopelagic and deepsea benthic ecosystem types.\nThe headline indicators of the NBA provide information on the pressures faced by species and ecosystems and on the progress made in protecting them. Combining the indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of marine ecosystems. There are 27 marine ecosystem types that are both highly threatened and under-protected. The highest priorities are the Critically Endangered Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic which is Not Protected and five ecosystem types that are both Endangered and Not Protected (Table x). This includes the Orange Cone Muddy Mid Shelf, Cape Lower Canyon, St Helena Bay, Cape Sheltered Rocky Shore and the KZN Bight Mid Shelf Reef Complex. Three ecosystem types are Critically Endangered and Poorly Protected; the Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf, Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge and Cape Bay. Endangered and poorly protected ecosystem types include several shore types in the Namaqua, Cape and Agulhas Regions, False and Walker Bay, Western Agulhas Bays, two ecosystem types on the southern KZN shelf and four ecosystem types in the KZN Bight.\nTable 1.

    "text": "Cumulative Pressures\nSouth Africa uses cumulative pressure mapping as a key input into the assessment of marine ecosystem threat status. A total of 31 pressures have been mapped to support biodiversity assessment and spatial planning1. These include historical pressures that may have ceased in some areas but have contributed to long term changes in ecological condition. Both the number and intensity of pressures is considered in cumulative pressure mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas ahve the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas with high cumulative pressures include most bays, the area offshore of the Orange River, the shelf edge off the west and south coasts, large portions of the Cape inner and middle shelf, the Agulhas Bank and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. The highest cumulative pressure in the marine realm was recorded in Saldanha Bay.\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which alter shorelines and circulation, increase urbanisation and access for fishers, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. New ports and harbours can have substantial impacts on marine biodiversity and livelihoods and therefore warrant careful evaluation in spatial planning and decision-making.\nSkein et al. (2022) examined 17 key pressures from 17 different sectors and their links to 23 key ecosystem characteristics (Figure 1) that have implications for ecosystem services. Fishing, petroleum (referred to as “Non-renewable (oil and gas)” in Figure 1) and shipping had the most widespread effects across the most ecosystem components, accounting for 30% of total linkage pathways identified, with fishing showing the most linkages overall. This is due to the extensive and complex nature of these three sectors, each of which comprise various components that may impact marine life in different ways. For example, offshore oil and gas sector activities include exploration (invasive and non-invasive), production and transport, each exerting different pressures on marine biodiversity. Anticipated renewable energy installations will have implications for marine ecosystems and species in future, through increased underwater noise, habitat modification and wildlife collisions, depending on the energy source (See below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. South African marine ecosystem risk assessment Sankey diagram illustrating links among sectors (left), their associated pressures (middle) and the ecological components (right) that are impacted by these pressures. The width of the lines represent the Impact Risk (describing the exposure and severity of an interaction). Sectors, pressures and ecological components appear in descending order based on sum Impact Risk scores (From Skein et al. 2022 hyperlink)\n\n\n\n\n\nPervasive pressures with multiple drivers (See Cross-cutting pressures) include pollution emanating from industrial, municipal and agricultural sources, ocean noise associated with activities such as shipping, mining and petroleum exploration, light pollution from artificial light at night especially in coastal areas, and invasive alien species.\nClimate change and ocean acidification, primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, cause diverse and interrelated pressures that impact marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. Furthermore, by creating stressful environmental conditions (e.g. altered temperatures or reduced oxygen levels), climate change and ocean acidification increase the vulnerability of marine life to other pressures such as pollution or the impacts of fishing.\nThe indirect and cumulative impacts of expanding ocean activities need more attention in marine environmental management. Failure to account for potential cumulative and indirect impacts will preclude such impacts from being taken into account in spatial planning and decision-making, with likely negative implications for people and the environment.",

    "text": "Sector and pressure overviews\nPressure data sets are important inputs into spatial assessments and planning. Marine pressure data for South Africa is described in the 2018 NBA marine technical report1 that explained and mapped each pressure, summarised patterns in their extent and intensity, and reviewed their known biodiversity impacts, noting any known mitigation measures or relevant work that was underway. Drawing on the above and information that is available in more recent Marine Spatial Planning reports (e.g. DFFE 2021 National data, ? etc) (KERRY CHECK THIS REFERENCE), a brief summary of sectors and pressures is provided below (only references not previously cited in Majiedt et al. (2019) are indicated).\n\nIn general, updating and improvement of pressure data sets is required. Outdated pressure maps, pressure data that are missing or of a poor resolution, and inaccurate estimation of pressure impacts on ecological condition, all reduce the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and the efficacy of spatial planning. For example, missing pressure data in certain areas or for certain sub-sectors (such as small-scale fishing) omits key rightsholders and compromises integrated and equitable spatial planning. Long-term pressure data series are needed for ecosystem and species assessment (Key message B5) and finer scale mapping for more accurate assessment of ecological condition.\n\nFishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFishing incorporates at least 19 South African fishing sectors representing industrial, commercial, small-scale, artisanal and recreational fisheries, with various methods employed to target a wide range of fish, invertebrate and seaweed resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nFishing methods include trawling (demersal and mid-water), longlining (demersal and pelagic), purse-seining, linefishing, squid jigging, trap fishing, hand harvesting, beach seining, and wet and dry kelp harvesting.\nMore than 700 marine species are directly affected by fishing in South Africa2 (KERRY CHECK THIS REFERENCE), with bycatch a key concern for trawl and longline fisheries. There have been improvements in managing incidental mortalities of seabirds, but bycatch of sharks, skates and rays is a driver of the threatened status of this group (shark species assessments) with work underway to support improved managementdepartmentofforestryfisheriesandtheenvironment? !!! (DFFE 2022 NPOA). More information on fisheries impacts on stock status or species threat status is reported in the species assessment section.\nFisheries affect benthic and pelagic ecosystems through multiple pathways of impact3, with the impact of the demersal trawl and longline fisheries on seabed habitats providing a straightforward example (Figure 2). Measures have been taken to manage the ecosystem impacts of trawl fishing through freezing the demersal hake trawl footprint, new co-developed spatial management measures and work to identify and protect Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (Franken PhD - need reference, Sink et al. 2025 - the trawl report).\nUnsustainable fishing includes overfishing of target or bycatch species and fishing practices that can have severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Overfishing can include unsustainable total numbers of fish being caught and overharvesting of specific size or age classes that are critical for maintaining population growth and fishery sustainability. Some fishing gear types are known incidentally catch high numbers of non-target species (bycatch or incidental mortalities) and/or to impact seabed habitats. Illegal fishing and ghost fishing from lost fishing gear are difficult to map and qualify, but these unsustainable fishing practices can have negative impacts on the food web (trophic effects) and lead to ecosystem degradation.\nAlthough industrial fisheries generally have greater and more widespread impacts on marine ecosystems and species, all sectors contribute to pressures in the marine realm. In terms of participation, the recreational fishery is the largest of all the fishing sectors in South Africa (460-550 000 fishers4). This and the high technical capacity5 of mobile recreational fishers dispersed across the coastline means that this sector has a significant impact on fisheries resources. Furthermore, the recreational fishery is currently ineffectively governed by inadequate policy and regulations and remains largely unmonitored and poorly enforced6, with high levels of non-compliance (~50%7) and poor environmental behaviours being the norm in many recreational fisher communities8 (Kramer et al. 2017; Farthing et al. 2025)??? Is this the kob cons strat????. While some principally commercial linefish species have demonstrated recent recovery, many species, also targeted by the recreational fishery, remain overexploiteddepartmentofforestryfisheriesandtheenvironment?, especially kobs (species assessment section) and some seabreams.\nThere is evidence of some pro-active, conscientious recreational fishers adopting voluntary catch-and-release and other best practices in a growing social movement of self-reform9,10. However, while there is growing acceptance of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) practice is an essential practice, there is a growing consensus that poor release practices can still contribute considerably to fishing mortality11,12.\nOverfishing can also impact genetic biodiversity of fishery species by reducing diversity and effective population size, compromising their resilience and ability to adapt (da Silva J, van Vuuren B, 2019). A recent study highlighted the long-term evolutionary costs of overfishing of the seventy-four seabream Polysteganus undulosus which has suffered drastic decline in genetic diversity and effective population size (Oosthuizen et al., 2024). Recent genomic studies on kingklip Genypterus capensis revealed three genetically distinct populations across southern African waters, with signs of local adaptation (Schulze et al., 2020), highlighting the need for sustainable, spatially specific, transboundary management. Similarly, the two African hake species (Merluccius spp.) italics? both show low genome-wide diversity. Shallow-water hake (M. capensis) shows three structured populations across the Benguela Current region, while deep-water hake (M. paradoxus), previously considered panmictic, now shows a split between the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean populations (Forde et al., 2023). Managing species with spatially distinct sub-populations as single stocks may further exacerbate their low genomic diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLethal shark control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has employed lethal shark control measures in the province of KwaZulu-Natal since 1952 to protect bathers from the risk of shark attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese measures, comprising gill nets and baited drum lines, are implemented to reduce the local or resident population of sharks in the vicinity of certain beaches, thereby reducing the probability of an ocean user encountering a shark. These measures are implemented between Richards Bay and Port Edward with 13.5 km of nets and 177 baited drumlines deployed in summer and 0.2 km of nets and 270 baited drumlines in winter (See Improvements in shark control measures). Biodiversity concerns associated with the shark control program include the overexploited and threatened status of several target and bycatch species of cartilaginous fishes (shark, rays, and chimeras), catches of turtles and marine mammal species (marine species page, and potential ecosystem effects linked to the removal of predatory sharks. Of the 14 species of large sharks regularly caught by the KwaZulu-Natal sharks board, 11 are threatened. All of the affected marine mammal and turtle species are listed as Threatened or Protected species under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act.\n\nLethal shark control measures add to the pressure on elasmobranchs from other fisheries, particularly longlining and trawl fisheries, but ecosystem effects from shark control programs are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. Historical and current nets were considered in the assessment of ecosystem condition, noting ongoing efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of shark control measures in KwaZulu-Natal.\nLethal shark control measures add to the pressure on elasmobranchs from other fisheries, particularly longlining and trawl fisheries, but ecosystem effects from shark control programs are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. Historical and current nets were considered in the assessment of ecosystem condition, noting ongoing efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of shark control measures in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteImprovements in shark control measures:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has taken several steps to reduce the impacts of lethal shark control measures on marine species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 Km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025. Nets have been replaced with baited drum lines in several areas and a distinct seasonal strategy to reduce negative impacts while maintaining bather safety. In particular, nets are removed during the annual sardine run during winter to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities on sharks and other species. Experimental work on mesh size, acoustic pingers and other innovations to reduce impacts have also been conducted and there is ongoing research to improve the evidence base for shark management. Overall, there is a reported 80% reduction in total catch and substantially reduced mortalities of sharks and other marine species (KZN Sharks Board pers. comm.). A network of researchers tag sharks and use satellite and acoustic tracking to better understand shark movement. Such data are very useful in better understanding shark distribution and risks in terms of location, season and other temporal trends.\nOther provinces have implemented non-lethal measures that have little to no impact on marine life and these measures are not included as a pressure layer in this assessment. Local conditions affect the feasibility of different models with history of shark control, visibility, sea conditions, vantage points, launch site proximity and the local infrastructure and networks affecting options for shark control and bather safety. Bather exclusion nets and a shark spotter programme help protect bathers in Cape Town, while Plettenberg Bay has also implemented shark spotters and an innovative network to support bather safety (WHAT WORD TO PUT HERE?) (NSRI technology). Two other countries that have shark control programs recently introduced new non-lethal measures including drones to help detect sharks and smart drumlines that alert crew when an animal takes the bait so that they can launch immediately to free any bycatch and euthanise (severely injured) target sharks (Reunion Island) or translocate them (Australia).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal and offshore mining is increasing in South Africa, targeting diamonds, heavy minerals and sand, and depending on the method of extraction, can have moderate to very severe negative impacts on biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpacts include habitat destruction and modification (including beach morphodynamic type), sediment suspension and increased turbidity, pollution, noise, changes in the distribution and feeding habits of species and the introduction of alien species. Ecosystems that are impacted include beaches and shallow and deep benthic ecosystems on the shelf (Biccard et al. 2018, Rangel-Buitrago et al. 2023, Manona et al. 2024).\nSuspended and deposited sediments caused by operations decrease feeding efficiency of filter feeders and clog fish gills, while increased turbidity from mine tailings can reduce primary production with reported changes in community structure. The potential for phosphate mining to commence remains a concern because the impacts of this activity could severely modify large areas of ecosystems and could jeopardise the sustainability of fisheries. The cumulative impacts of mining are a concern with increasing mining activity along South Africa’s west coast and shelf. Currently, there is no biodiversity information in the screening tool and limited information for the marine realm in the biodiversity and mining guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMarine petroleum activities in South Africa were initiated in 1969 with more than 300 offshore wells drilled to date and ongoing exploration by seismic survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of petroleum activities span the impacts associated with exploration, production and transport. Petroleum production has been suspended at the Oribi/Oryx and Sable oil fields (Block 9 off Mossel Bay) and the F-A Gas field and satellites but field development plans are underway at the Ibhubesi gas field off Hondeklipbaai. While production has largely decreased in recent years in South Africa, exploration activities have expanded into deeper water (Figure 3) and there has been increasing concern about the negative impacts of seismic surveys, in particular, on marine species and ecosystems. This is because of the intense and widespread noise that these surveys generate, which can have varied, far-reaching and cumulative impacts on multiple species and ecosystem processes. A cumulative map of seismic surveys was recently compiled and there is some progress in planning for the integration of underwater noise into assessments and planning (Sink et al. 2024 seismic report). See also the dedicated section on pollution below.\nBiodiversity impacts associated with drilling and production include habitat loss from infrastructure installation; chemical pollution from water- and oil-based drilling muds, noise and light pollution. These impacts can cause physical and physiological damage to marine organisms, disrupt feeding, communication and migration and alter species distributions and aggregations. Petroleum infrastructure including pipelines for transport can also introduce, provide refuge for and facilitate the spread of alien and invasive species. Oil spills, leaks and blowouts pose serious risks with the potential to cause catastrophic impacts to marine biodiversity by oiling marine organisms, degrading ecosystems, and disrupting ecological processes, while also causing health risks to people. The chemical dispersants used in cleaning up oil spills can also impact marine life, and in some cases, are considered more toxic than the oil itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShipping is a widespread source of pressure in South Africa’s marine realm and is a key source of underwater noise and other pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is a maritime nation with considerable ship traffic and one of the highest concentrations of cargo ship and oil tanker traffic globally. While shipping is the dominant form of underwater noise in the ocean, affecting a broad range of marine species (Duarte et al. 2021), there are also other environmental and biodiversity impacts, including other forms of pollution (e.g. chemical pollution, accidental oil spills, air pollution and other), the introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling, and ship strikes (collisions between vessels and large marine animals). South Africa still needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013. More effective management of shipping in noise sensitive areas such as marine protected areas, including by regulating the maximum speed of vessels, can strengthen protection by reducing underwater noise levels and the risk of collisions. See also the dedicated section on pollution below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal development, including port development, is a significant cause of pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems, leading to ecosystem loss, interruption of physical and biological process, and compromises in ecosystem resilience and services (Majiedt et al. 2019, Claasens et al. 2022, Harris et al. 2025 beach paper , Harris et al in review coastal pressures paper ) (link to Linda coastal page?).\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal development within the littoral active zone deprives beaches of the sand stored in dunes and reduces coastal resilience to storms, high wave-energy events and sea-level rise, increasing risks to coastal communities and infrastructure. Such development can require expensive artificial movement of sand or other coastal engineering solutions to mitigate downstream erosion. In addition to coastal development impacts, ports and harbours are the main points of introduction and refugia for invasive alien species, and activities associated with them contribute to ecosystem degradation from smothering, pollution, underwater noise and anchorage. Coastal disturbance is common at popular beaches and other accessible beaches (especially around access points), and includes trampling, dune destabilisation and disturbance of shore birds or other shore animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe biodiversity impacts of mariculture depend on the species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, husbandry practices and environmental conditions at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture along the South African coast includes farming of shellfish or finfish and takes the form of land-based operations that abstract seawater, pass it through a culture facility, and return it to the sea, and sea-based operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages suspended directly in the sea and a limited number of estuaries. Little research has been undertaken on the impacts of mariculture in South Africa but local work has highlighted the risks associated with eutrophication and the introduction of alien species, pathogens and diseases that can be transferred to wild stocks. For example, high stocking densities could potentially result in the evolution of native pathogens (especially viral and bacterial agents) to which wild fish do not have resistance. As such, mariculture can impact on ecosystem services.\nCurrently, sea-based mariculture takes place only in Saldanha Bay and Algoa Bay in South Africa. High retention and therefore lower rates of flushing of pollutants or elevated nutrient inputs in bays are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts of sea-based mariculture operations in these areas. Sea-based mariculture operations are also known to alter predator behaviour and movement patterns by causing them to aggregate in the vicinity of installations, and may therefore shift predation pressure on wild populations with resulting food web effects. Although there has been little success in sea-based aquaculture of bony fish in South Africa, mariculture remains a sector of projected growth, similar to petroleum and shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFreshwater flow reduction to the coastal and marine environment occurs when water is abstracted from rivers or dammed higher up in the catchment, and/or the cycle of an estuary has been disrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in freshwater, and the accompanying sediment that is vital to many marine biodiversity processes, failing to reach the sea. By reducing input of sediment that forms and maintain beaches, mud habitats and other unconsolidated sediment ecosystems, flow reduction leads to physical habitat changes including loss of beach and mud habitat, impacts on ecological functions and services including nursery functions, environmental cues, productivity, nutrient provision and food web processes. Potential reductions in key fisheries catches with associated negative economic impacts have also been reported in South Africa. A third of South Africa’s freshwater flow in rivers is estimated to no longer reach the ocean, including approximately two-thirds of the potential freshwater flow of the Orange River and nearly a third of that for the Thukela River (the two largest catchments in South Africa). Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated and coordinated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure (Key Message A7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWastewater discharge represents a significant source of pollution and includes a range of inputs, including industrial and municipal effluents, brine discharges from desalination plants, effluents from aquaculture operations, and stormwater and agricultural runoff (Porter et al. 2018, Majiedt et al. 2019, Ojemanye and Petrik 2022, Tyohemba et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 3 billion cubic metres of waste is discharged annually into South Africa’s marine environment through estuaries and outfalls, with municipal wastewater treatment facilities accounting for a significant portion of this. Wastewater discharge impairs water and sediment quality, and causes changes in the primary producer and benthic invertebrate communities near discharge points. High organic and nutrient loading due to wastewater discharge causes excessive eutrophication, fuelling red tides, harmful algal blooms and anoxia, often leading to fish kills. Coastal groundwater discharge is similarly enriched by human settlements, impacting shore ecosystems.\nTypically, coastal water quality is substantially degraded near major urban centres, with greatest negative impacts in areas with weak flushing and long retention, in particular bays. Associated microbial pollution can also have serious health and socio-economic impacts. For example, poor water quality has resulted in beach closures and loss of recreational value and tourism income. See also the dedicated section on pollution below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAmmunition disposal was practised in demarcated areas of the offshore environment from 1970s until 1995, before the London Protocol (1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter) came into effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nDumped ammunition can cause damage to or smothering of ecosystems and habitat-forming species; potentially detonate, causing localised destruction; and corrode, causing pollution and toxicity, especially from heavy metals. Elsewhere, there is evidence of munition compounds bioaccumulating in marine foodwebs, which is predicted to increase with time and with changes in ocean chemistry. Presumably, dumped munitions in South Africa have corroded over the past 30-50 years, but the impacts are largely unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDredge disposal is the dumping at sea of accumulated sediment from dredge material leading to smothering, increased turbidity, decreased primary production and other potential impacts (Smith et al.1995, 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\nDredging is a key service performed by the Ports Authority as part of harbour management and maintenance, whereby dredge material is collected from harbours to ensure that ships do not run aground. The type of disposal methodology applied, as well as the quality of the sediment being deposited, may amplify or mitigate these environmental impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRenewable energy production is important in achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts and supporting socio-economic growth in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) in South Africa includes offshore wind, wave, current and thermal energy sources. Although no MRE projects currently exist, there are plans for development, e.g. a floating offshore windfarm at Richard’s Bay and energy generation from the Agulhas current has been under discussion for several years. Depending on the energy source, potential impacts of MRE include habitat disturbance and loss during construction, changes in hydrology, localised upwelling and electromagnetic fields, collision risks with wind or current turbines for seabirds and ocean life and increased ocean noise. Wave and current devices may negatively impact marine mammals, turtles, and fish through collision risk, electromagnetic fields, and underwater noise, and marine benthic and pelagic habitats and communities could be impacted by changes to natural seawater flows and sediment transport. Small installations would likely have localised minor impacts but large commercial arrays could significantly alter marine systems over time.\nEmerging renewable energy installations include planned photovoltaic solar plants for Saldanha and Cape Town, and planned green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia) initiatives for Boegoebaai, Saldanha Bay, and Coega. Green hydrogen development requires extensive new coastal and marine infrastructure, likely including desalination plants, with associated brine discharge being an important environmental concern for coastal ecosystems. Other potential impacts include pollution from the production and transportation of hydrogen derivatives, like ammonia or methanol, which use catalysts and chemicals that could contaminate soil or water if not properly managed.",

    "text": "Cross-cutting pressures\n\nPollution (including underwater noise)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePollution is a cross-cutting pressure linked to many sectors with chemical (including plastic), pharmaceutical, noise and light pollution all increasing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlastic, both micro- and macro-plastic, is pervasive and has been recorded at great depths and distance from shore, although its main source is land-based pollution. Plastic pollution has impacts on many marine species through ingestion and entanglement, especially seabirds, turtles, sharks and fish. South African research is increasing and providing valuable insights into this global concern (Bakir et al 2020, Ryan 2020, Sparks and Immelman 2020, Ferguson et al. 2024), which recently has also been linked to the spread of alien and invasive species and identified as a vector for toxic metals (Awe et al. 2025). Other common pollutants in the marine realm are heavy metals and hydrocarbons, especially in ports and harbours (Melhorn et al. 2021, Mbandazi-Phorego et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIngestion and bioaccumulation of microplastics, metals, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products and other organic pollutants in animal tissues potentially leads to their biomagnification in marine food webs (Bakir et al. 2020, Ojemaye and Petrik 2022, Newman et al 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis poses toxic risks to lower and higher trophic level biota and humans who consume them. Bioaccumulation of pesticides and herbicides in coral reef organisms is an increasing concern (Porter et al. 2021, Tyohemba et al 2022), while high concentrations of metals, other chemicals, and pollutants have been detected in sediments (especially in ports and harbours), surf zones of popular recreational beaches and in sponges within submarine canyons. These pollutants have also been found in turtles and their eggs, seabirds and seabird eggs, fish, cetaceans, sharks and marine mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLight pollution or artificial light at night can negatively impact species and ecosystems by interrupting species’ natural circadian rhythms, changing night-time activity through either negative or positive phototaxis (Duarte et. Al. 2019, Fobert et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeding, breeding and resting behaviours are affected with impacts on turtle hatchlings and seabirds and beach invertebrates of particular concern (Duarte et al. 2019, Harris et al. 2025 beach ecosystem and species paper, Harris et al. in review pressure paper). For example, several beach species including the Endangered Cape pill bugs, Tylos capensis (nocturnal sandy beach isopods; Harris et al. 2025b) are significantly less active at night when exposed to higher light intensities, which reduces their foraging time. Light pollution can also affect navigation of seabirds and cause grounding with risk of injury or mortality (Heswell et al. 2022 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNoise pollution is an increasing concern, particularly in aquatic environments where sound conductivity is greater than in air and where many species rely on sound for prey location and communication (Nelms et al. 2016, Duarte et al. 2021, ).\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of sound include seismic surveys (Sink et al. 2025 seismic report), shipping traffic, bunkering (Pichegru et al. 2022), various other commercial activities, and boating. Elevated underwater noise can cause direct mortality, lower immunity and increase health risks, change species distributions and disrupt foraging when predators, prey, or both avoid noisy areas, and disrupt reproduction, communication and social behaviour.\nMarine mammals and soniferous fish are particularly at risk, including commercially important species such as kingklip, recreationally important species such as grunter and threatened species such as dusky kob and Syngnathid seahorses and pipefish. Recently, penguins have shown sensitivity to underwater noise (Pichegru et al. 2022). Although there are many known impacts from underwater noise, there are still many gaps in our understanding of these pressures (Elliot et al. 2019) and how they may translate into ecosystem impacts. It is recommended that noise sensitive marine areas are proactively mapped and used to inform marine spatial planning and management (Sink et al. 2025 seismic report).\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive alien species\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInvasive alien species have profound negative impact on marine biodiversity with increasing numbers of introduced marine species in South Africa (Miza et al. 2019, Robinson et al. 2020 book chapter???).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien species have the potential to displace native species, cause the loss of native genotypes, modify habitats, change community structure, affect food web properties and ecosystem processes, impede the provision of ecosystem services, impact human health and cause substantial economic losses. The main mechanisms of accidental introductions are ship fouling, ballast water and mariculture, with increasing recognition of the role of petroleum infrastructure and recreational boating in the introduction and intra-regional spread of invasive species. The expanding aquarium trade is also a source of introductions. Preventing marine invasives and limiting spread is vital as research shows that eradication in the marine realm is not feasible. This means that prevention is critical and key pathways, particularly ballast water and hull fouling, require monitoring (Loureiro et al 2021) and management action. South Africa needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013 and invest in innovative methods and partnerships to reduce hull fouling and the spread of marine invasives.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change\n\n\n\nCoral bleaching is a highly visible symptom of climate change ©Sean Porter, Oceanographic Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteClimate change exacerbates impacts of pressures on marine species and ecosystems through multifaceted pathways, decreasing resilience and threatening coastal communities and livelihoods (Kelly et al. 2019, Duncan et al. 2019, Mbokodo 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s oceans are changing with increased winds, upwelling and cooling being observed in some areas, and warming in others. Increased storm events, sea-level rise, intensification of current variability and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events have also been observed, and work is underway to support baselines to detect any potential changes in pH through ocean acidification (Edworthy et al. 2022, 2023).The impacts of these changes have been documented across a wide variety of marine taxa including kelp, other seaweeds, foraminifera, corals, sponges, molluscs, crustaceans, copepods, fish and seabirds. Reported impacts include shifts in the distribution of species and communities, changes in species abundance, altered behaviour, hybridisation, increased spread of invasive species, and long-term declines in fished stocks and copepods. Coral bleaching is increasing (Porter et al. 2021) with a need to invest in coral monitoring to track reef health. South Africa’s three coral ecosystem types are now considered Vulnerable and 34% of the 128 shallow reef building corals reported in South Africa have now been assessed as threatened (species summary page).\nClimate change does not act in isolation, it interacts with other anthropogenic pressures and understanding these interactions is critical for effective conservation and climate mitigation strategies to protect biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability. The complexity and variability of South Africa’s marine systems, combined with multiple anthropogenic stressors, make future climate impacts difficult to predict, but there is high certainty that negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security and valuable economic industries will continue to escalate.",

    "text": "Approach\nPressure data are a key input into ecosystem assessments including the assessment of ecosystem condition, ecosystem threat status and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The 2025 marine ecosystem assessment drew largely on the pressure data and information from the previous assessment (Sink et al. 2019), in which Majiedt et al. (2019) comprehensively reviewed and mapped 31 sources of pressure (spatial extent and intensity where feasible) on marine biodiversity in South Africa. These included 19 fisheries sectors, lethal shark control measures, mining, petroleum, shipping, ports and harbours, coastal development, coastal disturbance, mariculture, invasive species, freshwater flow reduction, waste water discharge, dredge material disposal and ammunitions dumping. Climate change literature was reviewed and synthesised (Kelly et al. 2019) and invasive species research (Miza et al. 2019) was also considered.\nLimited progress in pressure mapping was achieved for the 2025 assessment but seismic surveys and submarine cables were mapped for inclusion in future assessments and an improved, finer resolution demersal trawl fishing layer has been compiled (Currie et. al. 2023). The work towards an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for South Africa (Skein et al. 2022) also improved the understanding of pressure on marine biodiversity and was a key informant in the 2025 assessment.

    "text": "Freshwater ecosystems – rivers and inland wetlands – are the lifeblood of South Africa, underpinning our water security, economy, and cultural heritage. However, more than 60% are in a compromised ecological condition. This places at risk the vital services they provide, and the incredible biodiversity they support. It is of great concern that the number of threatened freshwater species continues to rise.\nRivers and inland wetlands are among the most threatened1 and least protected ecosystems in South Africa. More than 64% of river ecosystem types and 65% of wetland ecosystem types are threatened (Key Message B2).\nOver 30% (82/222) of river ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected (Not Protected). Over 20% (17/82) of inland wetland ecosystem types are both threatened and under-protected (Not Protected).\nIt follows that the freshwater species which these ecosystems support are increasingly highly threatened.\nOver 36% of all assessed freshwater taxa and 66% of assessed endemic freshwater taxa are threatened, while 36% of all freshwater fishes and 66% of endemic freshwater fishes are threatened.\nFreshwater fishes are the most threatened of all taxa in South Africa. With escalating pressures from human activities and climate change, it is highly concerning that 59 waterbird species have been uplisted, with 5 listed as Endangered, 11 Vulnerable and the remaining Near Threatened, while the African Shaggy Rat (previously African Marsh Rat) and the Laminate Vlei Rat have been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened during the current assessment. This is the first time that freshwater invertebrates have been included into the national biodiversity assessment.\nIn the face of increasing pressures, South African freshwater ecosystems continue to degrade faster than the investment in their conservation, management and rehabilitation. Key pressures include disruptions to the hydrological regime, deteriorating water quality (Key Message A3), direct habitat loss and biological invasions (Key Message A4), as well as the exacerbating effect of climate change (Key Message A1).\nAs freshwater ecosystems are affected by land use within their receiving catchment (Key Message A2), they are not easily protected within nature reserves and, therefore, implementation of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs2), ecological corridors and connectivity3 is vital. We must collaborate across all levels of society (Key Message C1) to conserve and wisely manage our remaining intact rivers and inland wetlands, and the freshwater species that they support. We must take urgent action to increase attention and funding on freshwater ecosystems and species, and to implement restorative actions in strategically identified areas.",

    "text": "Less than x% of river extent is considered Well Protected, placing rivers among the least protected ecosystems in South Africa. A whole catchment approach is needed to bend the curve on river conservation, as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. Xx of rivers within Protected Areas that were assessed to be Poorly Protected due to their ecological condition may be prime targets for effective restoration.\nApproximately #% of the country’s river length occurs in protected areas. Of the rivers within protected areas, only #% of these were assessed to be in a natural or near-natural condition. For this reason, only #% of river ecosystem types in South Africa are considered Moderately to Well Protected1 while #% are considered Not Protected2.\nFigure 1. Map showing the river Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) and a donut plot summarising the number of river types in each EPL category.\nThe rivers of northern KwaZulu-Natal, Lowveld and Succulent Karoo are generally less threatened than other regions of the country. Protection levels are particularly low in the northern interior of the country, reflecting the spatial distribution of the current protected areas network.\nTable 1. Ecosystem protection level of river ecosystem types.\nIn terms of river geomorphological zone, only 16% of the river ecosystem types within the lower foothill and mountain stream zones are Well Protected. More than half of lowland river ecosystem types are Not Protected (61%), reflecting the bias of the protected area network towards mountain versus lowland areas. It is evident that formal protection does not guarantee biodiversity conservation as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. A whole catchment and OECM approach, including conservation corridors, to river conservation is therefore required since most land-based protected areas were not designed to protect rivers.\n[photo]\nIt is encouraging that the extent of river length within the Protected Area network has increased by 10% / xx km [check] since the previous NBA analysis and that there is increased attention to rehabilitation of freshwater ecosystems within National Parks [cite] and Provincial Nature Reserves [cite]. While mountain streams have always enjoyed a stronger coverage than other river zones, it is [positive] to see an improved protected extent of lowland rivers as we strive to ensure that a well represented range of river types and geomorphological zones are conserved.\nRivers along PA boundaries are not considered well-protected.",

    "text": "Methods\n[Link to EPL_explained.qmd] Ecosystem Protection Level measures how well represented South Africa’s river ecosystem types3 are within the Protected Areas4 network.\nWe measured whether 30% of every river ecosystem type falls within a Protected Area. This is the current “target” we have set for our river ecosystems. This target is met if 100% of a river ecosystem type target (i.e the entire 30%) falls within the Protected Area network. The extent of each ecosystem type within the Protected Areas network is expressed as a proportion (target) of the total extent of that type. For the previous National Biodiversity Assessment (2018), the Ecosystem Protection Level target was set at 20% for freshwater ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Ecosystem Protection Level target has been increased to 30% in the EPL calculations.\nImportantly, the current condition of the river is also taken into consideration in the calculation. Ecosystem condition data [for each time point], was derived from the WRC-DWS Present Ecological State xxxx project. This allowed that only good condition river reaches were able to be considered as representative of Well Protected status; [while for MP PP and NP the condition of the rivers is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets - higher integrity / condition rivers contribute more to meeting PA targets than low integrity / condition rivers.]\nThere are four classes of protection and they are calculated as follows: Well Protected: 100% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; but only rivers in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and rivers in an A and B condition contribute 100%, rivers in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition rivers contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A&B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.",

    "text": "Inland wetlands are severely under-protected, with nearly 80% of wetland ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected (referred to as under protected). This is driven in part by poor ecosystem condition (only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem target).\nBy area, approximately 5% of inland wetland ecosystem extent is Well Protected, 6% is Moderately Protected, 69% is Poorly Protected and 20% is Not Protected. When considered according to wetland type, nearly 50% of inland wetland ecosystem types (41 of 82) are Poorly Protected and 27% (22 of 82) are Not Protected.\nWell Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape.\nAdd a sentence here.\nTable 1. Ecosystem Protection Level of inland wetland ecosystem types.\n[photo]\nIn terms of wetland hydrogeomorphic type, approximately 55% of unchannelled valley-bottom types are Not Protected, while 32% and 33% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are Not Protected. Depression wetlands have the highest protection level, with 33% of ecosystem types and 37% of extent considered to be Well Protected, while 11% and 10% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are considered Well Protected.\nSeventeen (20%) out of 82 inland wetland types are both threatened (i.e. CR, EN and VU) and under-protected (Not Protected). They are found on the Highveld, along the eastern escarpment, in the Cape Fold Mountains and the arid Northern Cape.\n&lt;!–\nexample of Figure 4.

    "text": "Approach\nEcosystem Protection Level measures the degree to which South Africa’s inland wetland ecosystem types [link] are represented within the protected area1 network. Ecosystem Protection Level was calculated for each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types. In line with Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, we measured whether 30% of every inland wetland ecosystem type falls within a Protected Area2. This target was met if 100% of an inland wetland ecosystem type target (i.e the entire 30%) falls within the Protected Area network. Importantly, the current condition of the wetland is also taken into consideration in the calculation3.\nThe extent of each ecosystem type within the Protected Areas network is expressed as a proportion (target) of the total extent of that type according to four classes of protection: Well Protected: 100% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; but only wetlands in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and wetlands in an A and B condition contribute 100%, wetlands in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition wetlands contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A&B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.",

The resulting overall PES score (A to F) per wetland was used in the EPL calculation. This allowed for only good condition wetlands to be considered as representative of Well Protected status; while for MP PP and NP the condition of the wetland used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets - higher integrity / condition wetlands contribute more to meeting PA targets than low integrity / condition wetlands.↩︎",

    "text": "Summary\nEstuary ecosystem types can serve as surrogates for ecosystem processes and enable predictions of biophysical characteristics. Understanding ecological processes and patterns associated with an estuary type facilitates an assessment of its resilience to anthropogenic pressures. This allows for extrapolation in data-limited environments Figure 1.\nThe estuarine classification scheme divided the biogeographical regions that characterise the South African coast into four major zones: the Cool Temperate (Orange to Ratel), the Warm Temperate (Heuningnes to Mendwana), the Subtropical (Mbashe to St Lucia) and the Tropical (uMgobezeleni to Kosi), with the latter being a new addition to the estuarine biogeographical provinces.\nAll rivers or streams with outlets to the sea were categorised broadly as estuaries and micro-systems. South Africa’s 290 estuaries are categorised into nine functional types, namely Estuarine lake, Estuarine bay, Estuarine lagoon (e.g. the groundwater-fed Langebaan system), Predominantly open, Large and Small temporarily closed, Large and Small fluvially dominated, and Arid predominantly closed. Micro-systems were further divided into micro-estuaries (42), micro-outlets, and coastal waterfalls based on spatial features and biotic observations in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Biographical regions\nThe traditional biogeographic organisation of South African estuaries has included only three dominant regions, viz. subtropical, warm-temperate and cool-temperate (Emanuel et al. 1992; Harrison 2002; Turpie et al. 2000). However, the tropical distribution of some species recorded in the Kosi and uMgobezeleni estuaries in the north, prompted subdividing the subtropical region and include a tropical transition zone in the north-east of South Africa. Both of these systems, albeit differing in size and function, are unique clear water estuaries on a small section of South African coast.\nKosi Estuary has uniquely tropical flora indicated by presence of the seagrass (Halodule universis) and mangrove species Lumnitzera racemosa, Ceriops tagal and Xylocarpus granatum that are found in no other South African systems (Van Niekerk et al 2020). Tropical species such as the Snake Sea Cucumber (Synapta maculate) and Pen Shell (Pinna muricata) (associated with H. universis) also point to a tropical influence on the system’s invertebrate fauna. The ichthyofaunal comprises a wide diversity of fishes, including tropical species not reported from any other South African estuaries (Blaber & Cyrus 1981). This is evidenced by the abundance and large sizes of several members of the Lutjanidae (snappers) in the system.\nTo the south, St Lucia Estuary supports invertebrate communities common in subtropical estuaries (MacKay et al. 2010). The Tropical zone aligns with marine biogeographic patterns evident for marine biogeographic map that includes the Natal-Delagoa tropical region (Sink et al. 2019).\nThus, the Estuarine Ecosystem Classification scheme defined the biogeographical regions as:\n\nCool-temperate from Orange Estuary on the Northern Cape to Uilkraals Estuary in the Western Cape;\nWarm-temperate from the Ratel Estuary near Cape Agulhas to Mendwana Estuary in the Eastern Cape;\nSubtropical stretches from the Mbashe Estuary in the Eastern Cape to the St Lucia Estuary in KwaZulu-Natal; and\nTropical from uMgobezeleni to Kosi Estuary in Northen KwaZulu-Natal.",

    "section": "What is an estuary?",
    "text": "What is an estuary?\nThe NBA 2025 defines an estuary as ‘a partially enclosed permanent water body, either continuously or periodically open to the sea on decadal time scales, extending as far as the upper limit of tidal action, salinity penetration or back-flooding under closed mouth conditions. During floods an estuary can become a river mouth with no seawater entering the formerly estuarine area or, when there is little or no fluvial input, an estuary can be isolated from the sea by a sandbar and become fresh or even hypersaline’ (Van Niekerk et al. 2020). A defining feature of this definition is that complex estuarine abiotic processes distinguish estuaries from other aquatic ecosystem types i.e. restricted tidal action, mixing of fresh and salt water, increased retention and/or increased water levels under closed mouth conditions.",

    "text": "Estuary functional types\nSouth Africa’s 290 estuaries are categorised into nine functional types, namely Estuarine lake, Estuarine bay, Estuarine lagoons (e.g. the groundwater-fed Langebaan system), Predominantly open, Large and Small temporarily closed, Large and Small fluvially dominated, and Arid predominantly closed Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Examples of South African estuary types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstuarine lakes\nEstuarine lakes comprise one or more typically large circular water bodies connected to the sea by a constricted inlet channel. Maximum water levels are determined by berm height, mouth state and freshwater input. Marine connectivity varies from almost permanently open to closed on annual scales. Salinities are highly variable, ranging from fresh to hypersaline because of differing freshwater input (surface and ground water), evaporation and the extent of the marine connection. Mixing processes are dominated by wind and, to a lesser extent fluvial inputs, owing to their restricted mouths and relatively large surface areas. Average tidal amplitudes are negligible (15 – 20 cm) when connected to the sea, primarily due to restricted mouth conditions. Sediment processes tend to be stable, with infilling occurring over long time scales and resetting confined to larger flood events.\n\n\nEstuarine bays\nEstuarine bays are permanently linked to the sea by unrestricted, deep mouths and are dominated by tidal processes, with tidal amplitudes close to those of the sea. These are large systems (&gt;1200 ha) with generally round basins where only the upper reaches experience a degree of constriction to tidal flows. As a result of relatively low river inputs they have a predominantly euhaline salinity regime in the lower and mid reaches, with freshwater mixing processes being mostly confined to the restricted upper areas. Sediments are typically marine in origin and grain size distributions are stable. There are two natural occurrences of Estuarine bays in South Africa (viz. Knysna and Durban Bay.\n\n\nEstuarine lagoons\nLangebaan Lagoon has many of the characteristics of an estuary (Whitfield 2005), including calm waters that are protected from marine wave action and biota that reflect many of the species usually found in estuaries. However, despite groundwater seeps into some areas, it lacks surface water inflow and a normal estuarine salinity gradient. Langebaan Lagoon represents a unique coastal ecosystem type and is recognised as an estuary because its ecological functioning includes both freshwater and marine inputs into a semi-enclosed embayment. Estuarine lagoons, as defined here, are permanently connected to the sea and are therefore marine dominated. Tidal action is the dominant mixing process and sedimentary processes are thus generally stable. Tidal amplitude and water levels are close to those of the sea.\n\n\nPredominantly open estuaries\nThese estuaries are open to the sea for more than 90% of the time. Some are permanently open owing to perennial river flows or the presence of large tidal prisms. Tidal amplitude ranges from 0.75-1.5 m. Predominantly Open estuaries are linear systems in which mixing processes are dominated by both fluvial inputs and tidal action creating vertical and horizontal salinity gradients. Under low flows, hypersalinity can develop in the upper reaches. The degree to which the mouth is restricted depends on the rate and volume of freshwater inflow. Some systems become severely constricted during low flow periods. Regular flooding results in relatively mobile sediments. These estuaries usually support wetlands, salt marshes, macrophyte beds and marine and estuarine fauna. Surprisingly, their size varies considerably ranging from 10 to 7500ha, with smaller systems afforded a degree of protection against direct wave action by rocky headlands or subtidal reefs, which assists in maintaining an open mouth.\n\n\nLarge and small temporarily closed estuaries\nThe sizable temporarily open/closed category of Whitfield (1992) was divided into Small and Large temporarily closed estuaries using a total habitat area of 15ha (associated with ~10ha of open water area) as the dividing threshold. The division was based on differences in biophysical processes and patterns. Small systems are likely to experience rapid increases and decreases freshwater runoff over a few hours making them strongly event driven. There will be little scouring during breachings, and a semi-closed mouth condition can easily develop owing to a small, perched, outflow channel that restricts tidal amplitude to 10 to 15cm. There is minimal water column area during the open state. Habitat diversity is likely to be low (and without intertidal salt marshes) and species diversity and abundance reduced.\nBoth large and small systems tend to be linear or funnel shaped with highly restricted inlets. Smaller systems especially tend to be ‘perched’ above normal tidal levels, resulting in little to no open water area during the open mouth low tide state. Water levels are dominated by the state of the mouth, with highest levels of 1 m to 2 m above mean sea level during the closed phase. Tidal ranges are very restricted, varying from 25-50 cm in Large temporarily closed estuaries to 15-30 cm in Small temporarily closed estuaries. Open phase mixing processes are dominated by fluvial input and partially by tides. When closed, wind and seepage losses through the berm play a key role. Sediment composition is largely stable, resetting mainly during floods. Salinity regimes range from almost fresh to hypersaline, which in large systems can develop during times of low flow or droughts. Small temporarily closed estuaries tend to be fresher in character as they have less connectivity with the sea.\n\n\nSmall and large fluvially dominated estuaries\nSmall and Large fluvially dominated systems to distinguish between small (&lt;15 ha), black water dominated, rocky temperate southern coast estuaries, and large, shallow, sediment rich, freshwater dominated systems of the east and west coasts. The larger systems have very high sediment turnover, often develop ebb-tidal deltas, are turbid and can close during periods of low flow, e.g. uThukela and Orange estuaries. Small, sediment-starved, fluvially-dominated systems have unrestricted mouths as they usually occur along rocky shores and receive clear humic-stained water from Table Mountain Sandstone catchments. Large fluvially dominated estuaries tend to be constricted and can even periodically close during low flows. River processes are dominant and salinities are mostly fresh throughout the estuary for more than half the time. During peak flood conditions, outflows can influence salinities for considerable distances offshore.\n\n\nArid predominantly closed estuaries\nThis type comprises six small estuaries (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord) and Wadrift) located in the arid Namaqua west coast region. They are linear or funnel shaped and closed on annual to decadal scales. Salinities tend to be high to hypersaline (&gt;35) as a result of low fluvial input and high evaporation rates. Thus, mixing processes tend to occur over long time periods and are dominated by the effects of evaporation, winds and seepage. Occasional breaching and over-washing during high sea conditions provide for marine connectivity. Sediment processes are generally stable on decadal time scales and are reset by large intermittent flash floods. Water levels are determined by the interplay between sand berm level, evaporation rates and seepage losses. Groundwater and inflows from local fountains replenish these losses and influence the salinity regimes of these estuaries.\nArid conditions promote the growth of unique vegetation such as salt tolerant, succulent Sarcocornia spp. and Salicornia spp. thatcan flourish despite open water salinities reaching above 200. Fish relies on ‘suicidal’ recruitment that is largely a function of connectivity with the sea and overwash during high seas. Fish survival depends on groundwater maintaining salinity gradients and hypersalinity not exceeding 40 in parts of the systems. Invertebrate diversity, abundance and community structure are related to changing salinity gradients including long cycles of hypersalinity, e.g. Shrimp Artemia sp. that hatch at salinities above 40 and encyst when salinities exceed 150. Cycles of Artemia abundance follow salinity regimes that in turn affect the diversity, abundance and occurrence of flamingos and other birds that feed on them.",

    "text": "Estuarine ecosystem types in South Africa\nThe Estuarine Ecosystem Classification system for South Africa’s 290 estuaries are derived from interplay between biogeographical regions and estuary functional types, stemming from the country’s diverse climatic, oceanographic and geological drivers.\nEstuarine lagoons are the rarest South African estuary type with only one member in the Cool Temperate region, followed by Estuarine bays with two in the Subtropical and one in the Warm Temperate region. Arid predominantly closed estuaries are confined to six systems in the Cool Temperate region. The Large and Small fluvially dominated types comprise seven systems each, occurring in three and two biogeographical regions, respectively. Small temporarily closed (116), Large temporarily closed (93), and Predominantly open (45) are the most dominant types occurring across the Cool Temperate, Warm Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions. Estuarine lakes occur across all four biogeographical zones. While not numerically dominant, this type represents the largest surface area of all estuary functional types, with Lake St Lucia representing more than half of South Africa’s estuarine surface area.\n\nEstuarine ecosystem examplesData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.\nThe IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:\n\nCriterion A2b (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.\nCriterion A3 (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022\nCriterion B3 was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by &gt;1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D1 was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D3 was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of &gt;= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity &gt;=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity &gt;=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\nEach of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.\nA more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at RLE explanation page.",

Use notes sparingly - mainly to clarify terms.\nSome text with a footnote1.\n\n\nReferences\nSee Quarto documentation for different ways to cite references. For reference citations to work, there needs to be a .bib file stored in the same folder as the .qmd file. Give the .bib file a unique name (i.e. change it from the default references.bib). Make sure to edit the yaml header to reference the correct .bib file. See this bibtex reference for the formats for different types of references. The references.bib file in the quarto folder contains some example references:\nHere is a citation of a journal article1.\nHere is a citation of a book2.\nHere is a citation of an edited book3.\nHere is a citation of a book chapter4.\nHere is a citation of a report5.\nHere is a citation of a website6.\nHere is a citation of multiple references5,7,8\nFor a chapter or section in a book that is part of a series (e.g. Vegetation of South Africa) use the @inproceedings format9",

    "text": "Code blocks for graphs, maps and tables\nUse these code blocks to ensure that your graphs maps and tables are consistently numbered and labeled. Using these code blocks also lets you cross-reference tables and figures in the text.\n\nGraphs and maps\nThe #| label: line in the code below makes it possible to reference the graph in the text. It must always start with fig- for Quarto to recognise it as a figure, and to apply correct styling and numbering to the figure caption. Each figure in your document must have a unique fig- name. To reference the figure in the text, use Insert &gt; Cross Reference, and look for the figure lable in the list.\nAdd an appropriate descriptive caption next to fig-cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Add figure caption here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nFollow the same system for creating tables. Do not use the visual editor to insert tables, as this will create a table in Quarto’s default style, and you will have to type in the data manually, making the table less reproducible if your data changes. Note that here you must use the tbl- prefix to ensure that quarto recognises it as a table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The 2025 pressure evaluation shows that a third of freshwater flow no longer reaches the coast (22% of systems severely impacted). Wastewater discharges amount to about 655 000 m3/d (32% of estuaries under severe pollution pressure), with harmful algal blooms (HABs) now recorded in 18% of estuaries in response to declining water quality. Over 22% of estuaries are also subjected to severe habitat modification.\nEstuaries, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and Wild Coast, are under extreme pressure from illegal gillnetting, with systems under severe pressure increasing from 15% to 21% to 28% between 2011, 2018 and 2025 (75%, 78% and 85% of area), significantly compromising the multiple benefits derived from estuaries. The mouths of only 15% of South African estuary are artificially manipulated, but these estuaries represent more than 60% of the total estuarine habitat in the country. Alien, extralimital or translocated fish occur in 25 % of South Africa’s estuaries. There are 22 species recorded to date with one to nine per system. A third of estuaries have invasive terrestrial plants occurring within the estuarine functional zone whilst aquatic invasive species heavily infest 8% of estuaries.",

    "text": "Understading key estuary pressure\nA brief summary of pressures is provided here with a description of each pressure, detailed the relative intensity of each pressure, summarised patterns in the extent and intensity of pressures, summarise biodiversity impacts of each pressure, and noting mitigation measures (1,2).\nKey pressure categories include (2):\n\nFreshwater flow modification impacts estuarine productivity and ecological functioning, affecting estuarine circulation and retention. It also impacts water chemistry (e.g., salinity, dissolved oxygen), sediment processes, and land-sea connectivity. In extreme cases, it can lead to type changes, causing closure of estuaries previously categorised as permanently open (3). Associated biological impacts include degradation of habitats such as intertidal mudflats, salt marsh, and mangroves. Changes in connectivity can impact life-cycle requirements of migrating species, and genetic exchange between estuaries and adjacent marine environment.\nLand-use and development refer to land-use such as agriculture, as well as hard infrastructure development such as harbours and ports. Direct effects include loss of abiotic and biotic habitat, changes in circulation patterns, disruption of erosion/depositional cycles, modified tidal regimes, premature mouth closure, water clarity, and declining primary productivity. Ultimately, habitat changes have cascading impacts on biota, affecting population size/biomass, community composition, and possible local extinctions. Habitat loss also reduces carrying capacity of estuaries, especially for higher trophic level species.\nInlet manipulations are driven by the need to enhance land-sea connectivity. Artificial breaching is the most prevalent activity in this category and isimplemented to alleviate back-flooding of poorly planned low-lying developments or agricultural land when the mouth closes (4;3). Reduced freshwater flow often results in increased inlet closure, higher sand bar levels, and increased flooding of surrounding environs (Stein et al., 2021). Closed conditions are associated with nuisance algae or macrophyte blooms in nutrient-enriched systems, with premature artificial breaching promoted as a mitigation measure. Premature breaching can alter seasonality in land-sea connectivity, while breaching at too low levels reduces scouring of accumulated sediment and organic matter, resulting in constrained tidal flows and shorter open periods. Inlet manipulation changes key hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes with cascading effects on primary productivity, species composition, and recruitment of larval fish and invertebrates (4). Inlet manipulation may also induce estuary type changes, e.g., changing temporarily open systems to permanently open systems (van Niekerk et al., 2020).\nPollution, specifically nutrient enrichment, results in excessive primary production and associated secondary impacts such as hypoxia (low oxgen) and loss of associated ecosystem services (1). Eutrophication results in loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, oxygen depletion, harmful algae blooms, imbalanced food webs, lower biodiversity, altered biogeochemical cycling, and fish kills. Pollution can change an estuary from a macrophyte-dominated to a phytoplankton- or macroalgae-dominated system. Toxic substances, such as trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (e.g., herbicides and pesticides), also pose significant ecological and human health risks.\nEstuaries function as nurseries and provide vital habitat for commercially important estuary-associated marine fish and invertebrates species (5). Fishing impact population size, biomass, sex-ratios, size/age distribution, community composition, trophic structure, and reproductive capacity. Depletion-driven declines in effective population size may also drive hybridization. Vulnerable life-history characteristics, e.g., estuary-dependence, ‘natal homing’ and predictable aggregations are amplified by anthropogenic pressures such as fishing, pollution, and flow modification, ultimately leading to recruitment failure or even extirpation.\nBiological invasions by invasive alien species pose an ever-increasing threat to estuaries causing ecological and economic damage. Alien species can alter abiotic and biotic habitats, change sediment/water pathways, nutrient/biogeochemical cycling, impact community structure and functions by modifying spatial and food chain resources, with direct or indirect effects on indigenous species. Economic concerns include reduced food sources, burrowing activities destabilising embankments, clogging of desalination/cooling water plants, and predation of commercially important species. Habitat degradation reduces overall estuary ecosystem resilience to alien invasive species such as invasive North American cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and Asian mollusc Tarebia granifera (6).\n\n\nFresh water flow modification\nMore than a third of freshwater flows to estuaries is now abstracted (36 900 to 24 800 x 106 m3/a). The most significant reduction occurs in the Cool Temperate region, mainly due to reduce flow to the Orange Estuary, which drains more than 60% of the surface area of South Africa. Followed by the Warm Temperate region, while losses in the wetter Subtropical region are less. Arid predominantly closed systems are most severely impacted by flow modification. These estuary types have a high sensitivity to flow modification, as they are in hot, arid environments subjected to high evaporation rates. Estuarine types supported by relatively large catchments, such as Large fluvially dominated, Predominantly open, and Large temporarily closed systems, also experience high to very high flow modification pressures.\nActivities that contribute significantly to flow modification include: run-of-river abstraction, dam development, alien vegetation infestation, return flows (e.g., wastewater and agriculture), groundwater abstraction, transfer schemes, hydroelectric schemes, and increased runoff from hardened catchment surfaces (e.g., urban development) (2). Of these, run-of-river freshwater abstraction, dams and weirs, and alien vegetation infestation are mainly responsible for decreasing inflow.",

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nTo estimate degree of pressure associated with flow modification, land-use and development, inlet manipulation, and pollution, ratings of related indicators in South Africa’s Estuarine Health Index (EHI) were applied (Turpie et al., 2012). The EHI considers both abiotic (hydrology, hydrodynamics and mouth condition, water chemistry, physical habitat) and biotic (microalgae, macrophytes, invertebrates, fish, and birds) indicators.\nEstuarine health is rated as similarity to natural (rated as 100) with pressure ratings correspond to: Low = &gt;75% similar to natural (Categories A - B), Medium = 75 - 60 % (Category C), High = 60 – 40 % (Category D) and Very high = &lt; 40% (Categories E - F).\nFor flow modification, the hydrological indicator, changes in low flow (60% of indicator rating) and floods (40% of indicator rating), or percentage reduction in mean annual runoff from natural, were used. For land-use and development, changes in physical habitat indicator were used to estimate degree of pressure.\nThe degree of pressure associated with inlet manipulation was derived from the hydrodynamic indicator, specifically similarity in inlet status. For pollution, a sub-indicator of water quality (scoring similarity in dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients and toxic substances) was applied.\nThe degree of exploitation of living resources (largely focused on fishing), was derived from a combination of the fish indicator rating, moderated by the nature and magnitude of fishing effort (e.g., number of fishers, traps, gillnets versus fishing rods and handlines); catch composition; and size/age distributions of fish in sample data sets. ‘Very high’ pressure was associated with gillnetting or fish traps. ‘High’ and ‘Medium’ indicated relative levels of recreational and/or subsistence exploitation. ‘Low’ indicated little fishing pressure, however, all estuaries reflect some impact of adjacent beaches and nearshore over-fishing. A few systems where no fish are found (e.g., hypersaline estuaries) were rated as ‘None’.\nTo assess the degree of pressure from alien invasive plants, data from various national databases were used and categorised into aquatic and terrestrial plants. Their presence was recorded across different reaches (i.e., lower, middle, and upper estuary), while the degree of pressure was estimated on a three-tier scale relative to percentage coverage of EFZ area: Low = alien coverage &lt;5%; Medium = alien coverage 5-15% and High = alien coverage &gt;15%. Data on microalgal and macroalgal blooms were also assessed using similar method.\nTo evaluate pressure from alien or extralimital (translocated) fish species-level information was used from2. In addition, unpublished freshwater fish species data and field observations were considered (2). A species list per estuary was compiled and fish grouped into to (1) egg and larvae eaters (Bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, Mosquito fish Gambusia affinis, Guppy Poecilia reticulata), (2) habitat altering species (Carp Cyprinus carpio, Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella) and (3) predatory species (Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, Spotted bass Micropterus punctulatus, Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus). Pressure rating for alien or extralimital fish were derived from the number and type of fish species present in individual estuaries, being Low = 1-2 species, Medium = 3-4 species, High = 5-6 species or 1-2 predatory species or Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus present (if translocated/ extralimital) or Very High = &gt;7 species or 3- 4 predatory species.",

    "text": "Overview\nSouth Africa’s southernmost territory, the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and the surrounding territorial sea and exclusive economic zone were included for the first time in the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018. The assessment of the PEIs marine ecosystem types found that 21% of ecosystem types are threatened by historical or current fishing, including one Endangered ecosystem type and five Vulnerable ecosystem types1. Marine mammals and birds species were assessed as part of the mainland Species Red List Assessments, since most of these also frequent South Africa’s mainland waters. There are 28 threatened or Near Threatened bird species breeding on the islands. Terrestrial ecosystem types are currently categorised as Data Deficient. The protection level assessment found that ten of the 29 marine ecosystems are Well Protected, 14 are Moderately Protected, one is Poorly Protected and four are Not Protected, whereas all terrestrial ecosystems are Well Protected. However, the efficacy of the protection of terrestrial ecosystems is compromised by biological invasions, particularly by the devastating impacts of the House Mouse (Mus musculus)2, and climate change. While understanding of the PEIs’ species and ecosystems has developed substantially over the last few decades, there is considerable room for improving knowledge of ecological condition and species population trends, especially under accelerated climate change and increasing seabird deaths from mouse attacks. An ambitious conservation campaign, Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project, are planning an island-wide mouse eradication on Marion Island, that will assist in improving the ecological condition of the island once financial targets are met.

    "text": "Background\nThe PEIs are situated approximately 1 700 km southeast of the mainland and are comprised of Marion Island and the smaller Prince Edward Island (Figure 1). The Subantarctic region has unique terrestrial and marine ecosystem types not found on the South African mainland or in its surrounding oceans. The PEIs support abundant marine and terrestrial biodiversity and are a critical breeding ground for seals and globally threatened seabirds. Decades of research conducted at the PEIs by a network of institutions have placed South Africa at the forefront of subantarctic and Antarctic science, and highlight the role of the PEIs as a natural laboratory for global change studies3. Including the PEIs in the NBA provided a valuable addition for regular reporting of past and current research at the islands, which could ultimately make an important contribution to the management and conservation of their unique biota by identifying and directing future research priorities. The terrestrial and marine biodiversity were assessed using IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) guidelines, and the first attempt at national assessment highlighted knowledge gaps and research priorities for the PEI research community to focus on moving forward. The previous 2018 ecosystem assessments are thus reported here1, as few ecosystems are endemic to the PEIs, requiring collaboration with and data on neighbouring subntarctic islands to conduct regional assessment.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystems at the Prince Edward Islands\nThe key input dataset for the terrestrial ecosystem assessment was the National Vegetation Map4. The digital map (Figure 2) delineates five vegetation types (equivalent to ecosystem types) within the PEIs that fall in either the Polar Desert biome or Subantarctic Tundra biome. It is fundamental that the assessment includes the entire distribution of ecosystem types. Therefore, since the terrestrial species and ecosystem types extend beyond South African borders to nearby subantarctic islands, a comprehensive global threat status assessment for these ecosystem types was not possible. \nThe first detailed map of the marine ecosystem types of the PEIs was produced as part of the NBA 2018 (Figure 2). The map was based on extensive research, consolidating historical and current information on regional biogeographic pattern, bathymetry and benthic ecosystems. The ecosystem types are therefore within regional ecosystems and some extend beyond national jurisdiction. The 29 marine ecosystem types are nested within nine functional groups and four ecoregions to represent marine biodiversity patterns. Increased investment in research has improved the PEIs’ marine ecosystem classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Ecosystem classification map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A) Ecosystem types across the entire EEZ; B) Terrestrial and shelf ecosystem types around the islands indicated by the white box in panel A).\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) are areas in the ocean that are characterised by their structural functionality and their vulnerability to bottom contact fishing gear. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) advanced the information for mapping of potential VMEs in the subantarctic territory since 2007 and this is the first map of relative density of VME indicator species in the PEIs (Figure 3). The map shows which ecosystem types are more sensitive to activities that may impact the seabed, including the Patagonian Toothfish fishery that is the main offshore activity in the region at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. A map showing the known distribution and relative abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems based on CCAMLR data. Darker purple areas have more VME records and are likely to be more fragile ecosystem types that are sensitive to activities that may damage the seabed.",

    "text": "Pressures\nThe terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the PEIs are generally well conserved and in considerably more natural condition than the ecosystems on and around mainland South Africa. While the terrestrial ecosystems of the PEIs are free from the typical direct pressures of the mainland (e.g. land clearing for croplands, human settlements), they are subject to indirect biotic disruption by biological invasions and climate change. The taxonomically and functionally depauperate terrestrial ecosystems, make them vulnerable to these biotic disruptions because a lack of biodiversity may lead to low ecosystem resilience. Unfortunately, spatial data on the impact and severity of climate change and invasive species are a key limitation to conducting threat assessments on these remote islands. A regional assessment will require additional ecosystem mapping efforts and condition data on nearby islands outside of South Africa’s territory. These pressures are the subject of ongoing research and in the near future regional assessments may be undertaken.  \n\nFishery for Patagonian Toothfish\nThe only pressure affecting the marine environment of the PEIs that could be mapped with available data is the commercial Patagonian Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery (Figure 4). Biodiversity concerns associated with the fishery include stock status concerns (as Toothfish are slow growing), interactions with seabirds and marine mammals5, and potential impacts on the seabed particularly in Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. This highly valued resource has led to substantial illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing within the PEIs EEZ6. This experimental fishery was initiated in 1996 and was converted to a commercial fishery in 2006. Catches of Toothfish during the legal experimental fishery were high with even higher illegal catches estimated in the mid-90s. Sanctions were then put in place to curb and monitor catches. Fishing effort data (total number of hooks set) was therefore available from 1997 and used to map fishing footprint until 2016 using a kernel density approach (95% value). Currently stock status and fishing pressure are considered optimal, with two rights holders currently in operation. Additionally, bycatch of seabirds has reduced from 0.19 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in 1996/1997 season, to 0.001 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in the 2001/2002 season in the legal fishery. However, poaching in the Southern Ocean remains a threat and the potential indirect impacts of intensive illegal fishing have not been studied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Patagonian Toothfish fishery footprint in the exclusive economic zone of the Prince Edward Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien invasive species\nThe key biotic disruption to the terrestrial ecosystems in the Subantarctic is alien invasive species. These include 26 alien invertebrates, one alien vertebrate (the House Mouse), and 18 alien plant species (many of which have become invasive). These species have severely impacted the ecology of the islands and caused alarming decreases in abundance of the indigenous biota. Three invasive plant species have caused major environmental impacts7, and are predicted to spread further on the islands with continued warming and drying. Sagina procumbens is one such invasive plant species, and has had the fastest rate of spread across the islands8 due to its wide ecological tolerance and ability to reproduce vegetatively and by seed9. Sagina procumbens increases the richness and abundance of invasive invertebrate species, indicating the interactive effect of invasive species. These terrestrial invasive species affect marine species that breed on the islands. Marine invasive species are also an emerging concern with some introduced marine taxa detected at other islands in the Subantarctic, but their impact at the PEIs is difficult to predict due to limited research in deep ecosystem types. Although the impact of many terrestrial and marine alien invasive species are an increasing concern, none have had a more profound effect than the House Mouse (see Box 1). Eight alien plant species have been effectively controlled since 2012 and ongoing research is being conducted on these and other species to better understand their impacts and inform appropriate control measures7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Mice on Marion Island\n\n\n\n\n\nMice were accidentally introduced to Marion Island by sealers in the 1800s. Cats were brought to the island in an attempt to control the mice in 1949, but they were eradicated in 1991 because of their devastating impact on seabirds10. Without sufficient control mechanisms, the mice have become the key threat to the island, impacting terrestrial and marine species and severely disrupting the ecology of these sensitive island ecosystems. The rapid increase in the mice population is due to an interactive effect of the lack of natural control, alien plant and invertebrate species, and climate change2. Mice have impacted all trophic levels, initially depleting macroinvertebrate populations and seed stock and, more recently, predating on Petrel and Albatross chicks and eggs11,12. Alarmingly, since the first detection of mouse attacks on adult Albatrosses was recorded in 202313, mouse wounds have spread rapidly on adults across the island14, with decreased breeding success of injured birds, and birds succumbing to the injuries. With 2.5 million pairs of seabirds breeding at the PEIs, they are particularly vulnerable to mammal invasions when aggregating in such vast numbers. Nineteen out of 29 birds species are at risk of becoming locally extinct if mice aren’t eradicated. This is in addition to the competition for resources and the direct impact of bycatch by fishing activity in their foraging areas. This highlights the urgent need for the planned mouse eradication.\n\n\n\n“Scalping” by mice of a Grey-headed Albatross (© Tom Peschak).\n\n\nThe burrowing activity of mice also directly impacts indigenous plants, even causing mortality in a keystone species, Azorella selago15. This is an ecosystem engineer cushion plant speices on the island, without which many of the island’s biota would not be able to survive in some of the harsher habitats on the island. Furthermore, the House Mouse’s excessive predation on terrestrial invertebrates has caused a considerable decline in the invertebrate-feeding, endemic Lesser Sheathbill, the islands’ only terrestrial bird16. The impacts of mice also have knock-on ecosystem level effects, such as decreased decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of heavy predation on the invertebrates that are an integral component of decomposition at the island17– thereby affecting ecosystem functioning.\nThe Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project has committed to eradicating the mice in a collaborative effort led by BirdLife South Africa and the Department of Forestry Fishereies and the Environment. Significant research effort has been directed to increase the probability of success of the largest island-wide eradication of rodents in the world, although financial constraints have impaired progress.

Since the mid-20th century, mean annual air and sea temperatures at the islands have increased by 1.2 and 1.4 °C, respectively – more than twice the mean global rate18– emphasising the islands’ global importance as ‘sentinels’ of climate change19.\nOn land, warmer air temperatures and more southerly winds have coincided with a considerable drying trend of the islands, with annual precipitation having decreased by 1000 mm per year from the 1960s to 202020. This has directly impacted the ecology of many terrestrial taxa, which evolved under a cool and wet subantarctic climate. As a result, the island is following a similar greening trend to cold environments globally, where an increase in biomass has been associated with a change in climate20. Impacts on vegetation include range expansions of generalist native and invasive plant species20, especially to the now less waterlogged mires and to higher, cooler altitudes, as well as range contraction of more specialist plant species21, whose strong association to specific habitat conditions limits their ability to capitalise on the changing climatic conditions. Warmer and drier conditions have exacerbated the spread of alien invasive species and compounded their negative effect on native species, which is expected to worsen with continued warming and drying. Such fundamental changes in the terrestrial community have major implications for ecosystem structure and functioning at the PEIs.\nIn the marine environment, warmer waters and faster currents linked to the southward movement of the Subantarctic Front have become more common, reducing local productivity and changing the trophic structure and composition of benthic communities1 . Decreased rainfall on land has reduced runoff of freshwater and nutrients into the sea, contributing to changes in local productivity and benthic ecosystems22. Epipelagic communities near the islands have changed in species composition, with Antarctic species decreasing and subtropical species becoming more common23. As the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts continue to migrate poleward, eddy generation at the South-West Indian Ridge is expected to decrease, reducing the advection of zooplankton and micronekton to the PEIs. These changes have implications for short- to medium-range predators such as Crozet Shag, and Gentoo, Rockhopper, Macaroni and King penguins – many of which have declined in recent decades.",

    "text": "Ecosystem Assessments\n\nEcosystem threat status (2018)\nA preliminary national threat status assessment, following the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework, was undertaken for the 29 marine ecosystem types (Figure 5). Criterion C1 (recent ecosystem degradation) was applied using the Patagonian Toothfish fishery footprint. The extent of the fishing footprint was calculated for each ecosystem type, and the severity of the impact was estimated to be Moderate throughout. Ecosystems with 80% or more of their extent within the fishing footprint were categorised as Endangered, those with 50% or more were categorised as Vulnerable, and those with less were considered Least Concern. At this stage, the presence and abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems was not considered in the assessment of threat status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Distribution of threatened ecosystems in Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone. The 5 terrestrial ecosystems are listed as Data Deficient. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each IUCN RLE category.\n\n\n\nSix (21%) of the 29 marine ecosystem types described, are threatened by fishing (Figure 5). There are five Vulnerable ecosystem types including the PEI Shelf Edge, Upper Slope and Mid Slope, which were threatened by historical fishing within the 12 nm territorial Sea (now a sanctuary zone of the Marine Protected Area). More than 65 % of the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Seamount and Upper Spreading Ridge are fished, making them Vulnerable. Only one ecosystem type is considered Endangered, the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Spreading Ridge, which has been fished over its entire extent. The remaining marine ecosystem types have been fished over less than half of their extent and so are considered Least Concern at this stage (Figure 5). Climate risks need to be incorporated in future assessments which also adopt a regional rather than a national approach.\nThe ecosystem threat status assessment for the five terrestrial PEI ecosystems was hampered by the lack of appropriate data on ecological condition and were thus assessed as being Data Deficient. These are national assessments and comprehensive regional or global assessment should remain the goal for these ecosystem types in future. This highlights the opportunity for co-operation with international partners to determine the distribution and condition of the PEIs’ ecosystem types beyond South Africa’s boundaries. It is possible that when the global situation is considered, some ecosystem types currently assessed as Least Concern or Data Deficient in the PEIs may change to threatened. \nWith biological invasion and climate change being the key threats to the PEIs, disruption of biological processes and ecosystem degradation is an increasing concern. There is a gap in our ability to understand thresholds of condition and there are challenges in measuring the subtler forms of habitat degradation in such remote regions. As a result, the level of modification of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, particularly the impact of demersal fishing on potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, may be under estimated. Better information on biotic disruptions (especially by mice, invasive plants and invertebrates) and environmental degradation (climate change and human impacts) are required for a meaningful assessment.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level (2018)\nEcosystem protection level is an indicator that tracks how well represented an ecosystem type is in the protected area network. For the PEIs, ecosystem protection level was computed by determining the proportion of each ecosystem type that falls within the protected area network. No ecosystem specific biodiversity targets have been set for PEIs ecosystems types and a fixed target of 20% was used. The categories for protection level are: Well Protected where the extent protected exceeds the biodiversity target; Moderately Protected where the extent protected is between 50 and 99% of the target; Poorly Protected where the extent protected is between 5 and 49% of the target; and Not Protected where the extent protected is less than 5% of the target. In order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category at least 20% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needed to be within the portion of MPA in which no fishing is permitted (12nm sanctuary and restricted zone AB); if this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nOverall, 86% of marine ecosystem types are afforded some protection by the MPA network (Figure 6). Ten marine ecosystem types are Well Protected (35%), 14 are Moderately Protected (48%), one is Poorly Protected (4%) and four are Not Protected (14%). All five terrestrial ecosystem types were categorised as Well Protected (Figure 6). As with the ecosystem threat status assessment, these are preliminary results that do not yet consider the regional or global extent of ecosystem types and better data on ecological condition could also affect future protection level assessments.\nTerrestrial ecosystems were declared a Special Nature Reserve in 1995, in terms of the Environment Conservation Act (No. 73 of 1989) and thus enjoy the highest level of protection afforded to any natural area under South African law. The PEI MPA is South Africa’s largest protected area across realms (169 966 km2 or 36% of the PEIs EEZ) and has a core sanctuary zone around the islands and one restricted zone (zone AB) in which no fishing is permitted (together making up 6% of the EEZ). There are a further three restricted zones in which fishing is limited (8% of EEZ), and a large controlled zone that accommodates the commercial Patagonian Toothfish fishery (22% of the EEZ). Where fishing overlaps with Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VMEs) and threatened ecosystem types, additional measures are needed to protect these ecosystems (e.g. the Southwest Indian Ridge in the northern portion of the EEZ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Ecosystem protection level map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Terrestrial ecosystems, represented in white, are all Well Protected. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each protection level category.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the marine environment of the PEIs has been heavily exploited by the commercial longline fishery for Patagonian Toothfish, the spawning biomass of which may only be a fraction of what is was pre-exploitation in the early 1990s. The establishment of the MPA was intended to contribute to the recovery of Toothfish populations, as well as provide protection for vulnerable and unique species and habitats. The zonation of fishing activity needs to be re-examined and fishing effort needs to be reduced in restricted zones to improve protection of marine ecosystem types.",

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem protection level (EPL) is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. This indicator measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in South Africa’s protected area network, and has been used as in national reporting since 2005.\nAfter comparing the extent extent of each ecosystem type under protection relative to its predefined biodiversity target (ranging 16-32%), with heuristics regarding the ecological condition within protected areas, ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories:\n\nWell Protected (WP): the extent target for the ecosystem type is met or exceeded within the protected area network\nModerately Protected (MP): 50 - 99% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nPoorly Protected (PP): 5 - 49% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nNot Protected (NP): &lt;5% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\n\nFor NBA 2025, the EPL indicator was calculated across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on EPL, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal Ecosystem Protection Level\nProportionately, the coast is slightly more protected than the rest of the land and sea (Figure 2, Table 1). This is positive given the myriad of benefits provided by coastal ecosystems and their disproportionately impacted and threatened status.\nAlthough 86% of coastal ecosystem types have some level of protection (163 of 190 types), only 19% are Well Protected, which accounts for 7% of the coastal extent (Figure 2, Table 1).\nThere is good progress in protecting coastal ecosystem types, but the national protected area network does need to be strengthened to afford protection to most of the coastal zone that is currently Poorly Protected or Not Protected (54% of types and 74% of extent), especially for coastal terrestrial and estuarine ecosystem types.\nIdeally, coastal ecosystem types should have cross-realm protection in contiguous land-based and marine protected areas. Good examples of cross-realm protection are: Garden Route National Park and Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area (MPA); iSimangaliso Wetland Park and MPA; De Hoop Nature Reserve and MPA; Addo Elephant National Park and MPA; and Namaqua National Park and MPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (A) number of types and (B) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal terrestrial ecosystem types are most Well Protected (22% of types, and 18% of extent); coastal marine ecosystem types have the largest percentage of ecosystem types in the top two categories, Well Protected and Moderately Protected (55% of types); and estuarine ecosystem types have the highest extent of protection across Well, Moderately and Poorly Protected (91% of extent) (Figure 2, Table 1).\nIn terms of Not Protected ecosystem types, the highest proportion of types is in the (coastal) terrestrial realm (20%), and the highest proportion of extent is in the (coastal) marine realm (31%) (Figure 2, Table 1).\n\nNumber of types Proportion of typesProportion of extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem threat status (ETS), also called ecosystem red list status, is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It is an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact or, alternatively, losing vital aspects of their structure, function or composition.\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the end point for ecosystem decline. The framework comprises a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition, and threatening processes.\nEach ecosystem type is assessed according to these criteria, and is then placed into one of several categories. Collectively, ecosystem types assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable are called ‘threatened’. Collapsed is the ecosystem equivalent of the species category, Extinct.\n\nCollapsed (CO)\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nEndangered (EN)\nVulnerable (VU)\nNear Threatened (NT)\nLeast Concern (LC)\nNot Evaluated (NE)\nData deficient (DD)\n\nFor NBA 2025, the RLE framework was applied across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on ETS, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal Ecosystem Threat Status\nThe South African coast is proportionately more threatened than the rest of the country (entire non-coastal territory combined, Figure 2, Table 1). In fact, the coast (71% threatened ecosystem types) proportionately has 3 times more threatened ecosystem types than the rest of the country (22%), which is proportionately 8 times more by extent (coastal: 46%, non-coastal: 6%). Areas where threatened ecosystem types are concentrated are around the Orange River mouth, through most of the Western Cape, in St Francis and Algoa bays, and along virtually the entire East Coast (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Coastal ecosystem threat status, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Ecosystem threat status of coastal ecosystem types by (A) number of types and (B) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 190 coastal ecosystem types in the EDCZ, 134 are threatened, comprising 40 Critically Endangered, 56 Endangered, and 38 Vulnerable ecosystem types (Figure 2, Table 1). These threatened types make up 99% of the estuarine realm, 49% of the coastal terrestrial extent, 43% of the coastal marine extent, and 46% of the overall coastal extent.\nIn comparison, there are 101 (22%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise 6% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea). Proportionately, this means the coast has three times the number of threatened ecosystem types and almost an order of magnitude (eight times) more threatened area than the rest of the South African mainland territory (Figure 2, Table 1).\n\nNumber of typesProportion of typesProportion of extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This is because pressures on land act more locally and intensively than they do in the aquatic realms, often causing complete habitat loss (e.g., houses replacing grasslands) rather than degrees of degradation (e.g., different pollution levels in estuaries).\nBecause the data and/or assessment methodologies have changed in the realm assessments since the NBA 2018, the results are not comparable between the two assessments. However, the latest results do show that the South African coastal zone is more threatened than was previously reported.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. Threat status of coastal ecosystem types in South Africa.

These 19 knowledge gap–research priority clusters are grouped under four themes:\n\n\nFoundational data and knowledge\n\n1. Advance the map of coastal ecosystem types\n\nImprove the rocky shore classification by advancing the wave exposure mapping from an expert-based layer to one underpinned by quantitative analysis.\nRevisit the classification and mapping of mixed shore ecosystem types.\nComplete the current, unpublished work on beach biogeography to confirm whether the tropical biogeographic break matches with that for estuaries and rocky shores, or whether it is indeed further north.\nImprove mapping of estuary plumes (sediment-laden water) and fluvial fans (accumulations of terrigenous sediment on the seabed) to support delineation of river-influenced ecosystem types.\nImprove classification and mapping of boulder and cobble shores.\nRevisit how micobialites are represented in the map of ecosystem types.\nVerify the inland extent of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\nRevisit the classification of seashore vegetation types to determine whether the dune sub-types should be classified and assessed per each of four seashore types, or if some of the sub-types need to be elevated to the level of a separate seashore vegetation type.\nRevisit the classification of inland wetlands to determine whether there are those that should be classified as coastal and included in the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n2. Improve taxonomic knowledge; map and assess coastal species\n\nImprove taxonomic knowledge, species distribution mapping and Red Listing of species.\nUndertake more recent surveys on which to base some of the ecosystem assessments (e.g., Estuarine Health Index).\n\n3. Address realm-specific foundational knowledge gaps to strengthen the coastal assessment\n\nSee realm-specific pages for foundational knowledge gaps; addressing these would contribute to strengthening the coastal assessment. \n\n\n\n\nPressures, pressure impacts and monitoring\n\n4. Map pressures and assess ecological condition at appropriate scales\n\nRefine the maps of pressures, particularly at the land-sea interface across the dunes and the shore.\nEnsure coastal pressures (especially in the seashore) are mapped at an appropriate resolution.\nUpdate the pressure maps where the data have become outdated.\n\n5. Map additional terrestrial pressures to include degradation as part of assessing ecological condition\n\nCoordinate national effort to measure, model, and map ecological condition in the terrestrial realm at a scale suitable for Red List of Ecosystem assessments and for reporting on international indicators.\n\n6. Determine freshwater- and sediment-flow requirements for coastal and marine systems\n\nQuantify the ecological flow requirements for all of South Africa’s estuaries, enhance understanding of the role of freshwater flow to offshore marine environments, and map of fluvial fans and plumes to support the classification and mapping of mud habitats.\nInvestigate sediment flows to beaches nationally to quantify contributions from different sand sources, and determine which beaches are being lost to erosion because they are losing sand at rates over and above natural cycles of sand loss and gain.\n\n7. Collect long-term data to improve models of climate change, and track impacts to coastal biodiversity\n\nDevelop and implement a cohesive framework and indicators to track biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts as a result of climate change, identify critical thresholds or points of non-return, and assess the effectiveness of interventions to minimise these impacts.\nEnsure that reliable weather station data are available throughout the South African coast.\n\n8. Map and better understand the impact of emerging pressures on coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove understanding of emerging pressures, e.g., various forms of pollution (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, light and noise), renewable energy, invasive species, and climate change.\nMap impacts of these pressures for inclusion in future assessments.\n\n9. Improve understanding of ecosystem degradation and links between pressures and impacts\n\nImprove understanding of interactions and impacts among pressures, and of cross-realm impacts to biodiversity.\n\n10. Groundtruth and refine thresholds for classifying ecological condition from habitat degradation\n\nGroundtruth maps of ecological condition with in situ measures and indicators, and use these to confirm thresholds for the categories of ecological condition.\n\n11. Invest in strategic long-term coastal biodiversity monitoring programmes\n\nCoordinate monitoring programmes that cover a range of taxa and a range of ecosystem types , e.g., Shallow Marine and Coastal Research Infrastructure (SMCRI).\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n12. Improve application of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria by testing scale and thresholds and creating models of ecosystem collapse\n\nDevelop conceptual models of ecosystem collapse.\nContinue testing different approaches to applying the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria and thresholds, in alignment with the latest guidelines, to advance red listing coastal ecosystem types.\n\n13. Investigate the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity as a second indicator for ecosystem protection level\n\nBuild on existing research to better understand effectiveness of protected areas in conserving coastal biodiversity, particularly cross-realm.\n\n14. Increase Red Listing of species, especially invertebrate and cross-realm species\n\nPrioritise assessment and monitoring of coastal species, including assessment of full taxonomic groups, of coastal species with high levels of potential threat, particularly endemic taxa (including invertebrates) and those that cross realms.\n\n15. Update and increase the number of fisheries stock status assessments\n\nIncrease reliable data for stock status assessments.\nIncrease the number of national stock assessments (especially for highly utilised economically important species).\n\n16. Assess the protection level of coastal species\n\nAssess the two components of species protection level: representation and effectiveness. This will need to be backed up with research on management effectiveness of protected areas for coastal taxa.\n\n17. Map and assess the status of coastal ecological infrastructure\n\nMap critical ecological infrastructure and assess its status. Systematic mapping of critical ecological infrastructure could be integrated into CBA Maps to add value to spatial planning and prioritisation towards securing the many benefits South Africans gain from coastal biodiversity\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and messaging\n\n18. Collect data and knowledge on the benefits of coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove collation of economic data, updated statistics on jobs and spatial data on biodiversity benefits.\n\n19. Identify strategies of communicating the benefits of biodiversity that most inspire action for change\n\nTest and identify methods of communication that best inspire action for change to complement communicating the results of the benefits of coastal biodiversity to people.",

    "text": "South Africa’s coastal zone has exceptional biodiversity, with 190 coastal ecosystem types supporting many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. The coast also provides numerous benefits to people, including food and materials, places to relax and play, and protection from storms and large waves. This means that the coast is also exposed to a number of pressures from human activities, on which the impacts of invasive species and climate change are superimposed. As a result, only half of South Africa’s coast is still in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter of the coast is severely to critically modified. Given the extent and severity of ecological degradation, 71% of the coastal ecosystem types are threatened. There is good progress in protecting coastal biodiversity, with a third (19%) of coastal ecosystem types meeting their targets for protection, such that they are considered Well Protected. This needs to be strengthened, however, because a quarter (14%) of the coastal ecosystem types are Not Protected. There are also 68 ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected). Restoring, managing and conserving coastal biodiversity in South Africa are key steps towards sustainable development, securing jobs and livelihoods, alleviating poverty, and enhancing human health and wellbeing. Planning cross-realm, in support of these actions, is essential.",

    "text": "Introduction\nSouth Africa’s coast is a national asset, rich in biodiversity, history and cultures that are all woven into the fabric of our national heritage. Despite comprising only 4% of the mainland extent, the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) includes nearly a fifth (20%, i.e., 190) of its 952 ecosystem types.\nThe South African coast has exceptional biodiversity, with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth, particularly along the national south coast. This is largely a result of the strongly contrasting conditions around the coast, driven by the warm Agulhas Current sweeping down the east coast, and cool Benguela Current up the west coast, with distinct patterns in temperature, rainfall and geology that create the physical underpinning of South Africa’s coastal biological diversity1.\nThe coast also provides a wealth of benefits to the economy, society, and human health and wellbeing that sustain and enrich the lives of many South Africans2. These include both tangible and intangible benefits, such as: provision of food, medicine and useful materials; coastal protection and disaster-risk reduction; water filtration, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration; tourism; job opportunities; places that support health, wellbeing, social cohesion, sports events, cultural and spiritual practices; and opportunities for learning and connecting with nature.\nThe coast is a relatively small area, but comprises a treasure trove of biodiversity and benefits for all South Africans to enjoy. It is no wonder that visiting South Africa’s beaches is one of the most popular tourism experiences by both local and international visitors.",

    "text": "Coastal ecosystem types\nThere are 190 coastal ecosystem types in South Africa, comprising 83 terrestrial, 22 estuarine, and 85 marine ecosystem types1. These ecosystems range from warm, mesic tropical and subtropical types in the north-east, to cool, arid and upwelling-driven types in the west. All of these ecosystem types have influences from both the land and the sea (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone in South Africa.1\n\n\n\nAlthough not currently included in the EDCZ, freshwater ecosystem types are likely to be included in future, particularly the coastal lakes, swamp forests (freshwater forested wetlands), dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones. There are also three micro-estuary types that are within the EDCZ; however, they are not currently assessed, and thus are not included in the count of coastal ecosystem types to simplify reporting.",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal biodiversity\nCoastal ecosystems in South Africa are under more cumulative pressure than the non-coastal areas of the mainland territory, with habitat loss on land occurring twice as fast in the coastal zone.\n\n\n\nMining (for diamonds, heavy-minerals, and sand) is a significant pressure in South Africa’s coastal zone, causing habitat fragmentation, degradation and loss, and increasing species extinction risk. There is proportionately five times more mining in the coast than in the rest of South Africa. Photo credit: © Fiona MacKay\n\n\nThe most intensive pressures in South Africa’s coastal zone are biological resource use, mining, and coastal development. Over-harvesting (including from poaching) is driving overexploited stock status and extinction risk in some species. Serial mining along the west coast and illegal mining are notable causes of concern, and are also key drivers of species extinction risk. Coastal development removes natural habitat and causes coastal squeeze as sea levels rise.\nReduced freshwater flow through estuaries impacts estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems as far offshore as the shelf edge in some places, with knock-on effects for coastal tourism, human health, and food and job security. Related to this is reduce sand delivery to the coast through rivers and estuaries. Between this and poor management of mobile dunefields, many beaches are sand-starved and in a state of erosion.\nPorts and harbours are key drivers of cumulative coastal impacts and ecological degradation by providing points of access to the sea, leading to burgeoning development, changing local shoreline orientation, and being pressure hotspots. Other transport and service corridors (roads, railway lines, shipping) also impact coastal ecosystems by replacing natural habitat, disrupting land-sea connectivity, and increasing pollution and the risk of invasive alien species.\nMany forms of pollution are impacting coastal biodiversity cross-realm, including chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals), sewage, plastics, light, noise, and dumped obsolete ammunition, but many of these pollutants are understudied and poorly understood, especially at a national scale. Deteriorating water quality from wastewater discharge, urban runoff, and agricultural runoff is a key issue in the coastal zone, particularly in retentive systems like estuaries and bays.\nBoth invasive species and climate change are exacerbating pressures to coastal biodiversity by changing natural ecological processes and reducing resilience of indigenous species. Some of the most important climate change impacts for coastal systems are sea-level rise, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms and floods, changes in rainfall and run-off, and temperature change, particularly temperature extremes in the form of heatwaves, and thermal shock when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling.",

    "text": "Ecosystem assessments\n\nEcological condition\nGiven the intensity and number of pressures to coastal biodiversity, half (48%) of the South African coast is no longer in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified (Figure 2, Figure 3). Proportionately, there more than double the amount of modified habitat in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Coastal ecological condition, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Ecological condition of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem threat status\nThe criteria in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems were applied to determine ecosystem threat status for the terrestrial, estuarine and marine assessments, with the results summarised here for the coastal ecosystem types. Ecosystem types were assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable (collectively referred to as threatened), Near Threatened, or Least Concern.\nThere are 134 (71%) threatened coastal ecosystem types that comprise 46% of the coastal extent, compared to 101 (22%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise 6% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea). Proportionately, this means the coast has 3 times the number of threatened ecosystem types and almost an order of magnitude (8 times) more threatened area than the rest of the South African mainland territory (Figure 4, Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Coastal ecosystem threat status, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Ecosystem threat status of coastal ecosystem types by (a) number of types and (b) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are not comparable with the results from the NBA 2018 given the different assessment methodologies between the two assessments, but improvements in data and methods have shown a more threatened status of the coast compared with that reported in 2018.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level was determined by calculating the proportion of each ecosystem type in a protected area, and evaluating these against a predefined biodiversity target per ecosystem type, with heuristics regarding the ecological condition of the ecosystem types under protection. Ecosystem types are assigned one of four categories of protection: Well Protected - biodiversity target is met; Moderately Protected - at least half the biodiversity target is met; Poorly Protected - more than 5% of the biodiversity target is met, and Not Protected - less than 5% of the biodiversity target is met.\nThere is good progress in representing coastal ecosystem types in protected areas, with 86% of 190 coastal ecosystem types now having some level of protection. However, only 19% of coastal ecosystem types are Well Protected, covering just 7% of the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ), meaning 81% of coastal ecosystem types covering 93% of the EDCZ are not yet meeting their biodiversity targets for protection (Figure 6, Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Coastal ecosystem protection level, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (a) number of types and (b) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are also not comparable with those from the NBA 2018 because of changes in biodiversity targets and assessment methodologies.\n\n\nCoastal ecosystem types at highest risk of loss\nThe ecosystem types that are at highest risk of loss can be identified by intersecting the results of the ecosystem threat status and protection level analyses, and sub-setting the results to the most threatened and most under-protected ecosystem types (Table 1). \n\n\n\n\nTable 1. NBA 2025 assessment results for South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types. Threat status: CR = Critically Endangered, EN = Endangered, VU = Vulnerable, NT = Near Threatened, LC = Least Concern. Protection level: WP = Well Protected, MP = Moderately Protected, PP = Poorly Protected, NP = Not Protected. Type values in any of the search boxes below to filter the list to rows of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 134 (of 190) threatened coastal ecosystem types (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable), 118 (88%) are under-protected (Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected, Not Protected). Sixty-Eight of these are high risk, because they are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered and Poorly Protected or Not Protected, Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. High-risk coastal ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (CR = Critically Endangered or EN = Endangered, and NP = Not Protected or PP = Poorly Protected).\n\n\n\nTo see which specific ecosystem types are highly threatened and under-protected, filter Table 1 to the categories indicated in Figure 8.",

    "text": "Case review and findings\nA comprehensive review of wildlife forensic cases analyzed in South Africa between August 2017 and July 2024 was recently conducted9. A total of 3 763 cases were examined, revealing significant trends in species representation and forensic demand (Figure 1):\n\nMammals accounted for the vast majority of cases, reflecting the high incidence of poaching and illegal trade involving species such as black and white rhinoceros, African elephant (Loxodonta africana), lion (Panthera leo), and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros).\nInvertebrate cases predominantly involved abalone (Haliotis midae), a species heavily targeted for illegal harvesting.\nFish cases had a focus on shark species due to their commercial and ecological significance.\nReptiles cases mainly focused on Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and various python species (Python spp.).\nBirds represented the fewest number of cases, and mainly involved ostrich (Struthio camelus) and white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Taxonomic representation of cases analyzed in South Africa over a seven-year period (August 2017 to July 2024).\n\n\n\nFor a more indepth look at the species and their representation in the various wildlife forensic cases analysed in South Africa, refer to Figure 2 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "Challenges and opportunities\nWildlife forensic science in South Africa has made significant strides, but several challenges continue to limit its full potential. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of resources, including funding, laboratory infrastructure, and trained personnel. Many forensic laboratories operate under constrained budgets, which affects their ability to process cases efficiently and invest in new technologies. Another major challenge is the absence of standardized protocols across institutions. Without harmonised procedures, results may vary between laboratories, which can undermine the credibility of forensic evidence in legal proceedings. Establishing national standards for sample collection, DNA analysis, and data interpretation is essential to ensure consistency and reliability. A third challenge is the limited availability of species-specific reference databases. These databases are crucial for accurate species identification, individual profiling, and geographic origin determination. However, building such databases requires extensive sampling, expert taxonomic verification, and long-term investment. For rare and endangered species, collecting sufficient reference data is particularly difficult.",

Investing in research: Continued innovation in molecular techniques such as developing new markers for species identification and refining geographic assignment methods is essential for keeping pace with evolving wildlife crime tactics.\nDeveloping regional databases: Cross-border wildlife crime is a growing concern. Building shared genetic databases across southern Africa will support regional enforcement and facilitate international cooperation.",
