    "text": "Monitoring Genetic Diversity using Indicators\nGenetic diversity underpins all biological diversity, playing a key role in individual fitness (an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce), species’ ability to adapt to changing environments, and overall ecosystem resilience. The genetic diversity of many wild species has declined in recent decades and greater declines are projected through ongoing habitat loss and population size reductions. Local extinctions, reduced population sizes and disruption of genetic connectivity mean that many of the populations that exist today have insufficient genetic diversity to persist in the long term.\nCore Conservation Genetic Principles\nConservation monitoring is guided by key principles (Figure 1), which together capture genetic diversity at multiple scales:\n\nSafeguard evolutionary distinctiveness – preserves unique branches of the tree of life.\nProtect genetically distinct populations – maintains adaptive potential within species.\nEnsure populations are large enough for long-term persistence – reduces loss of diversity through genetic drift1 and inbreeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Representation of three core conservation genetic principles focused on safeguarding evolutionary distinctiveness (A & B), protecting genetically distinct populations to minimize the risk of losing evolutionary evolutionary distinctiveness and ensuring all populations are large enough to ensure their long-term persistence (C). Red lines represent deep phylogenetic branches at risk, which can be caused by either entire clades of species being threatened with extinction (e.g., pangolins; A) or by threatened species isolated on long branches of the phylogenetic tree (e.g., secretary bird, B). C: Dashed lines represent the loss of a genetically distinct amphibian population, while polygons with solid lines represent different existing populations, each differing in size with the largest being the most likely to avoid genetic erosion. A & B taken from Gumbs et al., 2023.\n\n\n\nIn line with these principles, South Africa has adopted four genetic indicators from the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which can be based on direct genetic data or on proxies (when genetic data are not available; namely the Ne 500 and PM indicators).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Proportion of populations with an effective population size greater than 500 (Ne 500 indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA headline indicator in the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a high-level, mandatory metric that captures the overall scope of Goal A and Target 4 of the GBF.\nEffective population size (Ne) represents the number of individuals in a population contributing to the gene pool. At any given time or reproductive cycle not all adults reproduce, consequently Ne is a subset of the number of individuals in a population (typically 10 to 30% of the census size). Studies have identified a threshold of Ne greater than 500 signifying a genetically stable and healthy population into the long term; while below 500, the risk of extinction increases. The Ne 500 indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no populations of a species have Ne above 500 and 1 indicating all populations exceed the 500 threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Proportion of populations maintained within species (PM indicator)\n\n\n\n\n\nA complementary indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework, providing additional context for in-depth analysis but is not required for reporting.\nThis indicator is based on the principle that genetic differences increase as populations are farther apart in geographic and/or environmental distance. By maintaining distinct populations, species are more able to adapt and evolve. The PM indicator ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating all populations have been lost (species is extinct) and 1 indicating that all populations are still present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Changing status of evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species (EDGE index)\n\n\n\n\n\nA component indicator in Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a detailed metric that measures progress towards a specific target or goal within the framework.\nThis index is grounded in the understanding that genetically distinctive and threatened species would represent a significant loss to the tree of life if they are lost, making their preservation crucial. It is a tool for monitoring the changes in the conservation status of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage. For each taxonomic group that has a phylogeny, a value of 0 indicates that none of the genetically distinctive species are threatened and a value of 1 indicates that all genetically distinctive species are threatened with extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis complementary indicator is estimated as the total phylogenetic diversity in a phylogeny weighted by the probability of extinction for each species. This can be expressed as a percentage of the total phylogenetic diversity for the clade, where 100% would indicate that all species have the highest possible probability of extinction and all PD is expected to be lost, while 0% suggests that all species are safe from extinction and no PD is expected to be lost. The larger number of threatened species that contribute to high phylogenetic diversity, the more diversity is expected to be lost into the future.",

South Africa reported a PM value of 0.95 and Ne 500 value of 0.42.

While this first assessment incorporated a relatively small number of species, the species included were from a wide variety of taxonomic groups, ecosystems, distributions and conservation statuses.\nImportantly, these national metrics can be dissagregated in various ways, such as by taxonomic group (Table 1) or conservation status (Figure 2), to explore patterns and trends across different biodiversity components, similar to species and ecosystems assessments.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Tracking the Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity\n\nA Case Study on South Africa’s Amphibians and Reptiles\nSouth Africa is home to exceptionally rich and evolutionarily unique biodiversity, the loss of which would represent a significant erosion of the country’s evolutionary heritage. Using comprehensive Red List assessments together with detailed evolutionary (phylogenetic) trees, researchers can estimate how much of this evolutionary hertiage could be lost if threatened species for extinct - a metric known as Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity — the proportion of evolutionary history likely to be lost if currently threatened species go extinct.\nIn a recent case study2, this approach was applied to South Africa’s amphibians and reptiles, both of which have exceptionally high levels of endemism (around 50%). By integrating extinction risk data with measures of phylogenetic diversity (PD), researchers found that, without conservation action, about 6.5% of amphibian PD and 5% of reptile PD could be lost over the next 50 years (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The PD indicator for South African amphibians (red) and reptiles (purple), calculated at three intervals between 1990 and 2020. Values are estimated as the percentage of phylogenetic diversity (PD) expected to be lost within 50 years3. Dated national phylogenies were used along with probabilities of extinction, inferred from backcasted IUCN scores weighted according to Gumbs et al. (2023) (CR = 0.97, EN = 0.49, VU = 0.24, NT = 0.12, and LC = 0.06).\n\n\n\nImportantly, areas rich in PD did not always coincide with regions of high species richness, revealing new priorities for conservation to protect large portions of South Africa’s evolutionary heritage (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Expected loss of phylogenetic diversity for South African A) amphibians and B) reptiles, generated using national phylogenies where branch lengths were weighted by the probability of all descendant species becoming extinct3. The highest risk for both groups is estimated to be found in the tropical east, while for amphibians, notable concentrations appear in montane regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. For reptiles, extreme concentrations of expected PD loss can be found in the north-east of KwaZulu-Natal and in the north-west of the Northern Cape Province.\n\n\n\nThis study provides a national framework for monitoring phylogenetic biodiversity and its expected loss, aligned with global biodiversity monitoring goals. It demonstrates an approach that can be extended to other taxonomic groups, helping ensure that conservation strategies safeguard not only species, but also the deep evolutionary lineages and adaptive potential that make South Africa’s biodiversity globally unique.",

One of the most pressing issues is the lack of resources, including funding, laboratory infrastructure, and trained personnel. Many forensic laboratories operate under constrained budgets, which affects their ability to process cases efficiently and invest in new technologies. Another major challenge is the absence of standardized protocols across institutions. Without harmonised procedures, results may vary between laboratories, which can undermine the credibility of forensic evidence in legal proceedings. Establishing national standards for sample collection, DNA analysis, and data interpretation is essential to ensure consistency and reliability. A third challenge is the limited availability of species-specific reference databases. These databases are crucial for accurate species identification, individual profiling, and geographic origin determination. However, building such databases requires extensive sampling, expert taxonomic verification, and long-term investment. For rare and endangered species, collecting sufficient reference data is particularly difficult.",

The coast also provides numerous benefits to people, including food and materials, places to relax and play, and protection from storms and large waves. This means that the coast is also exposed to a number of pressures from human activities, on which the impacts of invasive species and climate change are superimposed. As a result, only half of South Africa’s coast is still in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter of the coast is severely to critically modified. Given the extent and severity of ecological degradation, 71% of the coastal ecosystem types are threatened. There is good progress in protecting coastal biodiversity, with a third (19%) of coastal ecosystem types meeting their targets for protection, such that they are considered Well Protected. This needs to be strengthened, however, because a quarter (14%) of the coastal ecosystem types are Not Protected. There are also 68 ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered, and Not Protected or Poorly Protected). Restoring, managing and conserving coastal biodiversity in South Africa are key steps towards sustainable development, securing jobs and livelihoods, alleviating poverty, and enhancing human health and wellbeing. Planning cross-realm, in support of these actions, is essential.\n\n\n\nDe Hoop dunefield is an iconic feature in South Africa’s coastal zone. Photo credit: © Peter Chadwick",

    "text": "Introduction\nSouth Africa’s coast is a national asset, rich in biodiversity, history and cultures that are all woven into the fabric of our national heritage. Despite comprising only 4% of the mainland extent, the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) includes nearly a fifth (20%, i.e., 190) of its 952 ecosystem types.\nThe South African coast has exceptional biodiversity, with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth, particularly along the national south coast. This is largely a result of the strongly contrasting conditions around the coast, driven by the warm Agulhas Current sweeping down the east coast, and cool Benguela Current up the west coast, with distinct patterns in temperature, rainfall and geology that create the physical underpinning of South Africa’s coastal biological diversity1.\nThe coast also provides a wealth of benefits to the economy, society, and human health and wellbeing that sustain and enrich the lives of many South Africans2. These include both tangible and intangible benefits, such as: provision of food, medicine and useful materials; coastal protection and disaster-risk reduction; water filtration, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration; tourism; job opportunities; places that support health, wellbeing, social cohesion, sports events, cultural and spiritual practices; and opportunities for learning and connecting with nature.\nThe coast is a relatively small area, but comprises a treasure trove of biodiversity and benefits for all South Africans to enjoy. It is no wonder that visiting South Africa’s beaches is one of the most popular tourism experiences by both local and international visitors.",

    "text": "Coastal ecosystem types\nThere are 190 coastal ecosystem types in South Africa, comprising 83 terrestrial, 22 estuarine, and 85 marine ecosystem types1. These ecosystems range from warm, mesic tropical and subtropical types in the north-east, to cool, arid and upwelling-driven types in the west. All of these ecosystem types have influences from both the land and the sea (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone in South Africa.1\n\n\n\nAlthough not currently included in the EDCZ, freshwater ecosystem types are likely to be included in future, particularly the coastal lakes, swamp forests (freshwater forested wetlands), dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones. There are also three micro-estuary types that are within the EDCZ; however, they are not currently assessed, and thus are not included in the count of coastal ecosystem types to simplify reporting.",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal biodiversity\nCoastal ecosystems in South Africa are under more cumulative pressure than the non-coastal areas of the mainland territory, with habitat loss on land occurring twice as fast in the coastal zone.\n\n\n\nMining (for diamonds, heavy-minerals, and sand) is a significant pressure in South Africa’s coastal zone, causing habitat fragmentation, degradation and loss, and increasing species extinction risk. There is proportionately five times more mining in the coast than in the rest of South Africa. Photo credit: © Fiona MacKay\n\n\nThe most intensive pressures in South Africa’s coastal zone are biological resource use, mining, and coastal development. Over-harvesting (including from poaching) is driving overexploited stock status and extinction risk in some species. Serial mining along the west coast and illegal mining are notable causes of concern, and are also key drivers of species extinction risk. Coastal development removes natural habitat and causes coastal squeeze as sea levels rise.\nReduced freshwater flow through estuaries impacts estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems as far offshore as the shelf edge in some places, with knock-on effects for coastal tourism, human health, and food and job security. Related to this is reduce sand delivery to the coast through rivers and estuaries. Between this and poor management of mobile dunefields, many beaches are sand-starved and in a state of erosion.\nPorts and harbours are key drivers of cumulative coastal impacts and ecological degradation by providing points of access to the sea, leading to burgeoning development, changing local shoreline orientation, and being pressure hotspots. Other transport and service corridors (roads, railway lines, shipping) also impact coastal ecosystems by replacing natural habitat, disrupting land-sea connectivity, and increasing pollution and the risk of invasive alien species.\nMany forms of pollution are impacting coastal biodiversity cross-realm, including chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals), sewage, plastics, light, noise, and dumped obsolete ammunition, but many of these pollutants are understudied and poorly understood, especially at a national scale. Deteriorating water quality from wastewater discharge, urban runoff, and agricultural runoff is a key issue in the coastal zone, particularly in retentive systems like estuaries and bays.\nBoth invasive species and climate change are exacerbating pressures to coastal biodiversity by changing natural ecological processes and reducing resilience of indigenous species. Some of the most important climate change impacts for coastal systems are sea-level rise, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms and floods, changes in rainfall and run-off, and temperature change, particularly temperature extremes in the form of heatwaves, and thermal shock when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling.",

    "text": "Ecosystem assessments\n\nEcological condition\nGiven the intensity and number of pressures to coastal biodiversity, half (48%) of the South African coast is no longer in a natural to near-natural state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified (Figure 2, Figure 3). Proportionately, there more than double the amount of modified habitat in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Coastal ecological condition, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Ecological condition of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem threat status\nThe criteria in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems were applied to determine ecosystem threat status for the terrestrial, estuarine and marine assessments, with the results summarised here for the coastal ecosystem types. Ecosystem types were assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable (collectively referred to as threatened), Near Threatened, or Least Concern.\nThere are 134 (71%) threatened coastal ecosystem types that comprise 46% of the coastal extent, compared to 101 (22%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise 6% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea). Proportionately, this means the coast has 3 times the number of threatened ecosystem types and almost an order of magnitude (8 times) more threatened area than the rest of the South African mainland territory (Figure 4, Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Coastal ecosystem threat status, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Ecosystem threat status of coastal ecosystem types by (a) number of types and (b) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are not comparable with the results from the NBA 2018 given the different assessment methodologies between the two assessments, but improvements in data and methods have shown a more threatened status of the coast compared with that reported in 2018.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level was determined by calculating the proportion of each ecosystem type in a protected area, and evaluating these against a predefined biodiversity target per ecosystem type, with heuristics regarding the ecological condition of the ecosystem types under protection. Ecosystem types are assigned one of four categories of protection: Well Protected - biodiversity target is met; Moderately Protected - at least half the biodiversity target is met; Poorly Protected - more than 5% of the biodiversity target is met, and Not Protected - less than 5% of the biodiversity target is met.\nThere is good progress in representing coastal ecosystem types in protected areas, with 86% of 190 coastal ecosystem types now having some level of protection. However, only 19% of coastal ecosystem types are Well Protected, covering just 7% of the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ), meaning 81% of coastal ecosystem types covering 93% of the EDCZ are not yet meeting their biodiversity targets for protection (Figure 6, Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Coastal ecosystem protection level, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (a) number of types and (b) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are also not comparable with those from the NBA 2018 because of changes in biodiversity targets and assessment methodologies.\n\n\nCoastal ecosystem types at highest risk of loss\nThe ecosystem types that are at highest risk of loss can be identified by intersecting the results of the ecosystem threat status and protection level analyses, and sub-setting the results to the most threatened and most under-protected ecosystem types (Table 1). \n\n\n\n\nTable 1. NBA 2025 assessment results for South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types. Threat status: CR = Critically Endangered, EN = Endangered, VU = Vulnerable, NT = Near Threatened, LC = Least Concern. Protection level: WP = Well Protected, MP = Moderately Protected, PP = Poorly Protected, NP = Not Protected. Type values in any of the search boxes below to filter the list to rows of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 134 (of 190) threatened coastal ecosystem types (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable), 118 (88%) are under-protected (Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected, Not Protected). Sixty-Eight of these are high risk, because they are highly threatened and under-protected (Critically Endangered or Endangered and Poorly Protected or Not Protected, Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. High-risk coastal ecosystem types that are highly threatened and under-protected (CR = Critically Endangered or EN = Endangered, and NP = Not Protected or PP = Poorly Protected).\n\n\n\nTo see which specific ecosystem types are highly threatened and under-protected, filter Table 1 to the categories indicated in Figure 8.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps and research priorities\nNineteen knowledge gaps have been identified as research priorities to strengthen further coastal biodiversity foundational knowledge and understanding of impacts to coastal biodiversity to improve assessment, and also to better understand the benefits of biodiversity and the best ways of communicating the these in a way that most inspires South African’s into action for change towards long-term sustainability. These 19 knowledge gap–research priority clusters are grouped under four themes:\n\n\nFoundational data and knowledge\n\n1. Advance the map of coastal ecosystem types\n\nImprove the rocky shore classification by advancing the wave exposure mapping from an expert-based layer to one underpinned by quantitative analysis.\nRevisit the classification and mapping of mixed shore ecosystem types.\nComplete the current, unpublished work on beach biogeography to confirm whether the tropical biogeographic break matches with that for estuaries and rocky shores, or whether it is indeed further north.\nImprove mapping of estuary plumes (sediment-laden water) and fluvial fans (accumulations of terrigenous sediment on the seabed) to support delineation of river-influenced ecosystem types.\nImprove classification and mapping of boulder and cobble shores.\nRevisit how micobialites are represented in the map of ecosystem types.\nVerify the inland extent of the ecologically determined coastal zone.\nRevisit the classification of seashore vegetation types to determine whether the dune sub-types should be classified and assessed per each of four seashore types, or if some of the sub-types need to be elevated to the level of a separate seashore vegetation type.\nRevisit the classification of inland wetlands to determine whether there are those that should be classified as coastal and included in the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n2. Improve taxonomic knowledge; map and assess coastal species\n\nImprove taxonomic knowledge, species distribution mapping and Red Listing of species.\nUndertake more recent surveys on which to base some of the ecosystem assessments (e.g., Estuarine Health Index).\n\n3. Address realm-specific foundational knowledge gaps to strengthen the coastal assessment\n\nSee realm-specific pages for foundational knowledge gaps; addressing these would contribute to strengthening the coastal assessment. \n\n\n\n\nPressures, pressure impacts and monitoring\n\n4. Map pressures and assess ecological condition at appropriate scales\n\nRefine the maps of pressures, particularly at the land-sea interface across the dunes and the shore.\nEnsure coastal pressures (especially in the seashore) are mapped at an appropriate resolution.\nUpdate the pressure maps where the data have become outdated.\n\n5. Map additional terrestrial pressures to include degradation as part of assessing ecological condition\n\nCoordinate national effort to measure, model, and map ecological condition in the terrestrial realm at a scale suitable for Red List of Ecosystem assessments and for reporting on international indicators.\n\n6. Determine freshwater- and sediment-flow requirements for coastal and marine systems\n\nQuantify the ecological flow requirements for all of South Africa’s estuaries, enhance understanding of the role of freshwater flow to offshore marine environments, and map of fluvial fans and plumes to support the classification and mapping of mud habitats.\nInvestigate sediment flows to beaches nationally to quantify contributions from different sand sources, and determine which beaches are being lost to erosion because they are losing sand at rates over and above natural cycles of sand loss and gain.\n\n7. Collect long-term data to improve models of climate change, and track impacts to coastal biodiversity\n\nDevelop and implement a cohesive framework and indicators to track biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts as a result of climate change, identify critical thresholds or points of non-return, and assess the effectiveness of interventions to minimise these impacts.\nEnsure that reliable weather station data are available throughout the South African coast.\n\n8. Map and better understand the impact of emerging pressures on coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove understanding of emerging pressures, e.g., various forms of pollution (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, light and noise), renewable energy, invasive species, and climate change.\nMap impacts of these pressures for inclusion in future assessments.\n\n9. Improve understanding of ecosystem degradation and links between pressures and impacts\n\nImprove understanding of interactions and impacts among pressures, and of cross-realm impacts to biodiversity.\n\n10. Groundtruth and refine thresholds for classifying ecological condition from habitat degradation\n\nGroundtruth maps of ecological condition with in situ measures and indicators, and use these to confirm thresholds for the categories of ecological condition.\n\n11. Invest in strategic long-term coastal biodiversity monitoring programmes\n\nCoordinate monitoring programmes that cover a range of taxa and a range of ecosystem types , e.g., Shallow Marine and Coastal Research Infrastructure (SMCRI).\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n12. Improve application of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria by testing scale and thresholds and creating models of ecosystem collapse\n\nDevelop conceptual models of ecosystem collapse.\nContinue testing different approaches to applying the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria and thresholds, in alignment with the latest guidelines, to advance red listing coastal ecosystem types.\n\n13. Investigate the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity as a second indicator for ecosystem protection level\n\nBuild on existing research to better understand effectiveness of protected areas in conserving coastal biodiversity, particularly cross-realm.\n\n14. Increase Red Listing of species, especially invertebrate and cross-realm species\n\nPrioritise assessment and monitoring of coastal species, including assessment of full taxonomic groups, of coastal species with high levels of potential threat, particularly endemic taxa (including invertebrates) and those that cross realms.\n\n15. Update and increase the number of fisheries stock status assessments\n\nIncrease reliable data for stock status assessments.\nIncrease the number of national stock assessments (especially for highly utilised economically important species).\n\n16. Assess the protection level of coastal species\n\nAssess the two components of species protection level: representation and effectiveness. This will need to be backed up with research on management effectiveness of protected areas for coastal taxa.\n\n17. Map and assess the status of coastal ecological infrastructure\n\nMap critical ecological infrastructure and assess its status. Systematic mapping of critical ecological infrastructure could be integrated into CBA Maps to add value to spatial planning and prioritisation towards securing the many benefits South Africans gain from coastal biodiversity\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and messaging\n\n18. Collect data and knowledge on the benefits of coastal biodiversity\n\nImprove collation of economic data, updated statistics on jobs and spatial data on biodiversity benefits.\n\n19. Identify strategies of communicating the benefits of biodiversity that most inspire action for change\n\nTest and identify methods of communication that best inspire action for change to complement communicating the results of the benefits of coastal biodiversity to people.",

These actions also align well with the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 and Targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nNow more than ever, South Africa is poised to secure key coastal biodiversity and ecological infrastructure: half the coast is in natural to near-natural ecological condition, and the integrated map of ecosystem types1,2 and results from this assessment pave the way for better biodiversity planning, management and decision-making in the coastal zone.\nCross-realm planning is essential to ensure that land-sea ecological processes and species distributions are adequately accounted for in land-based and marine Spatial Biodiversity Plans (Maps of Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas - CBA Maps, and associated land and sea-use guidelines). These Spatial Biodiversity Plans are a key tool by which to align governance, planning and decision-making across realms and across organs of state to achieve effective, science-based and proactive integrated coastal zone management3.",

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem threat status (ETS), also called ecosystem red list status, is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. It is an indicator of the degree to which ecosystems are still intact or, alternatively, losing vital aspects of their structure, function or composition.\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework uses the concept of ecosystem collapse as the end point for ecosystem decline. The framework comprises a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition, and threatening processes.\nEach ecosystem type is assessed according to these criteria, and is then placed into one of several categories. Collectively, ecosystem types assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable are called ‘threatened’. Collapsed is the ecosystem equivalent of the species category, Extinct.\n\nCollapsed (CO)\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nEndangered (EN)\nVulnerable (VU)\nNear Threatened (NT)\nLeast Concern (LC)\nNot Evaluated (NE)\nData deficient (DD)\n\nFor NBA 2025, the RLE framework was applied across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on ETS, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal Ecosystem Threat Status\nThe South African coast is proportionately more threatened than the rest of the country (entire non-coastal territory combined, Figure 2, Table 1). In fact, the coast (71% threatened ecosystem types) proportionately has 3 times more threatened ecosystem types than the rest of the country (22%), which is proportionately 8 times more by extent (coastal: 46%, non-coastal: 6%). Areas where threatened ecosystem types are concentrated are around the Orange River mouth, through most of the Western Cape, in St Francis and Algoa bays, and along virtually the entire East Coast (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Coastal ecosystem threat status, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Ecosystem threat status of coastal ecosystem types by (A) number of types and (B) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 190 coastal ecosystem types in the EDCZ, 134 are threatened, comprising 40 Critically Endangered, 56 Endangered, and 38 Vulnerable ecosystem types (Figure 2, Table 1). These threatened types make up 99% of the estuarine realm, 49% of the coastal terrestrial extent, 43% of the coastal marine extent, and 46% of the overall coastal extent.\nIn comparison, there are 101 (22%) threatened ecosystem types that comprise 6% of the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea).

This is because pressures on land act more locally and intensively than they do in the aquatic realms, often causing complete habitat loss (e.g., houses replacing grasslands) rather than degrees of degradation (e.g., different pollution levels in estuaries).\nBecause the data and/or assessment methodologies have changed in the realm assessments since the NBA 2018, the results are not comparable between the two assessments. However, the latest results do show that the South African coastal zone is more threatened than was previously reported.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. Threat status of coastal ecosystem types in South Africa.

    "text": "Introduction\nEcosystem protection level (EPL) is one of the headline indicators of the National Biodiversity Assessment. This indicator measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in South Africa’s protected area network, and has been used as in national reporting since 2005.\nAfter comparing the extent extent of each ecosystem type under protection relative to its predefined biodiversity target (ranging 16-32%), with heuristics regarding the ecological condition within protected areas, ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories:\n\nWell Protected (WP): the extent target for the ecosystem type is met or exceeded within the protected area network\nModerately Protected (MP): 50 - 99% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nPoorly Protected (PP): 5 - 49% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\nNot Protected (NP): &lt;5% of the extent target for the ecosystem type is met within the protected area network\n\nFor NBA 2025, the EPL indicator was calculated across all realms, and the results are summarised here for the 190 coastal ecosystem types that were assessed. For more details on EPL, see the general introduction to this headline indicator.",

    "text": "Coastal Ecosystem Protection Level\nProportionately, the coast is slightly more protected than the rest of the land and sea (Figure 2, Table 1). This is positive given the myriad of benefits provided by coastal ecosystems and their disproportionately impacted and threatened status.\nAlthough 86% of coastal ecosystem types have some level of protection (163 of 190 types), only 19% are Well Protected, which accounts for 7% of the coastal extent (Figure 2, Table 1).\nThere is good progress in protecting coastal ecosystem types, but the national protected area network does need to be strengthened to afford protection to most of the coastal zone that is currently Poorly Protected or Not Protected (54% of types and 74% of extent), especially for coastal terrestrial and estuarine ecosystem types.\nIdeally, coastal ecosystem types should have cross-realm protection in contiguous land-based and marine protected areas. Good examples of cross-realm protection are: Garden Route National Park and Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area (MPA); iSimangaliso Wetland Park and MPA; De Hoop Nature Reserve and MPA; Addo Elephant National Park and MPA; and Namaqua National Park and MPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types by (A) number of types and (B) extent of types\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal terrestrial ecosystem types are most Well Protected (22% of types, and 18% of extent); coastal marine ecosystem types have the largest percentage of ecosystem types in the top two categories, Well Protected and Moderately Protected (55% of types); and estuarine ecosystem types have the highest extent of protection across Well, Moderately and Poorly Protected (91% of extent) (Figure 2, Table 1).\nIn terms of Not Protected ecosystem types, the highest proportion of types is in the (coastal) terrestrial realm (20%), and the highest proportion of extent is in the (coastal) marine realm (31%) (Figure 2, Table 1).\n\nNumber of types Proportion of typesProportion of extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Overview\nSouth Africa’s southernmost territory, the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and the surrounding territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were included for the first time in the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018. The assessment of the PEIs marine ecosystem types found that 21% of ecosystem types are threatened by historical or current fishing, including one Endangered ecosystem type and five Vulnerable ecosystem types1. Marine mammals and birds species were assessed as part of the mainland Species Red List Assessments, since most of these also frequent South Africa’s mainland waters. There are 28 threatened or Near Threatened bird species breeding on the islands. Terrestrial ecosystem types are currently categorised as Data Deficient. The protection level assessment found that ten of the 29 marine ecosystems are Well Protected, 14 are Moderately Protected, one is Poorly Protected and four are Not Protected, whereas all terrestrial ecosystems are Well Protected. However, the efficacy of the protection of terrestrial ecosystems is compromised by biological invasions, particularly by the devastating impacts of the house mouse (Mus musculus)2, and climate change. While understanding of the PEIs’ species and ecosystems has developed substantially over the last few decades, there is considerable room for improving knowledge of ecological condition and species population trends, especially under accelerated climate change and increasing seabird deaths from mouse attacks. An ambitious conservation campaign, Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project, are planning an island-wide mouse eradication on Marion Island, that will assist in improving the ecological condition of the island once financial targets are met.

    "text": "Background\nThe PEIs are situated approximately 1 700 km southeast of the mainland and are comprised of Marion Island and the smaller Prince Edward Island (Figure 1). The subantarctic region has unique terrestrial and marine ecosystem types not found on the South African mainland or in its surrounding oceans. The PEIs support abundant marine and terrestrial biodiversity and are a critical breeding ground for seals and globally threatened seabirds. Decades of research conducted at the PEIs by a network of institutions have placed South Africa at the forefront of subantarctic and Antarctic science, and highlight the role of the PEIs as a natural laboratory for global change studies3. Including the PEIs in the NBA provides a valuable additional mechanism for regular reporting of past and current research at the islands, which could ultimately make an important contribution to the management and conservation of their unique biota by identifying and directing future research priorities. The terrestrial and marine biodiversity were assessed using IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) guidelines, and the first attempt at national assessment highlighted knowledge gaps and research priorities for the PEI research community to focus on moving forward. The previous 2018 ecosystem assessments are thus reported here1, as few ecosystems are endemic to the PEIs, requiring collaboration with and data on neighbouring subantarctic islands to conduct regional assessments.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystems at the Prince Edward Islands\nThe key input dataset for the terrestrial ecosystem assessment was the National Vegetation Map4. The digital map (Figure 2) delineates five vegetation types (equivalent to ecosystem types) within the PEIs that fall in either the Polar Desert Biome or Subantarctic Tundra Biome. It is fundamental that the assessment includes the entire distribution of ecosystem types. Therefore, since the terrestrial species and ecosystem types extend beyond South African borders to nearby subantarctic islands, a comprehensive global threat status assessment for these ecosystem types was not possible. \nThe first detailed map of the marine ecosystem types of the PEIs was produced as part of the NBA 2018 (Figure 2). The map was based on extensive research, consolidating historical and current information on regional biogeographic pattern, bathymetry and benthic ecosystems. The ecosystem types are therefore within regional ecosystems and some extend beyond national jurisdiction. The 29 marine ecosystem types are nested within nine functional groups and four ecoregions to represent marine biodiversity patterns. Increased investment in research has improved the PEIs’ marine ecosystem classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Ecosystem classification map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A, ecosystem types across the entire EEZ; B, terrestrial and shelf ecosystem types around the islands indicated by the box in panel A.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems\nVulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) are areas in the ocean that are characterised by their structural functionality and their vulnerability to bottom contact fishing gear. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) advanced the information for mapping of potential VMEs in the subantarctic territory since 2007 and this is the first map of relative density of VME indicator species in the PEIs (Figure 3). The map shows which ecosystem types are more sensitive to activities that may impact the seabed, including the Patagonian toothfish fishery that is the main offshore activity in the region at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. A map showing the known distribution and relative abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) based on CCAMLR data. Darker purple areas have more VME records and are likely to be more fragile ecosystem types that are sensitive to activities that may damage the seabed.",

    "title": "Summary of findings",
    "section": "Pressures",
    "text": "Pressures\nThe terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the PEIs are generally in more natural condition than the ecosystems on and around mainland South Africa. While the terrestrial ecosystems of the PEIs are free from the typical direct pressures of the mainland (e.g. land clearing for croplands, human settlements), they are subject to indirect biotic disruption by biological invasions and climate change. The taxonomically and functionally depauperate terrestrial ecosystems make them vulnerable to these biotic disruptions, because low biodiversity may lead to low ecosystem resilience. Unfortunately, spatial data on the impact and severity of climate change and invasive species are a key limitation to conducting threat assessments on these remote islands. A regional assessment will require additional ecosystem mapping efforts and condition data on nearby islands outside of South Africa’s territory. These pressures are the subject of ongoing research and in the near future regional assessments may be undertaken.  \n\nFishery for Patagonian toothfish\nThe only pressure affecting the marine environment of the PEIs that could be mapped with available data is the commercial Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery (Figure 4). Biodiversity concerns associated with the fishery include stock status concerns (as toothfish are slow growing), interactions with seabirds and marine mammals5, and potential impacts on the seabed particularly in Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. This highly valued resource has led to substantial illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing within the PEIs EEZ6. This experimental fishery was initiated in 1996 and was converted to a commercial fishery in 2006. Catches of toothfish during the legal experimental fishery were high with even higher illegal catches estimated in the mid-90s. Sanctions were then put in place to curb and monitor catches. Fishing effort data (total number of hooks set) was therefore available from 1997 and used to map fishing footprint until 2016 using a kernel density approach (95% value). Currently stock status and fishing pressure are considered optimal, with two rights holders currently in operation. Additionally, bycatch of seabirds has reduced from 0.19 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in 1996/1997 season, to 0.001 birds killed per 1 000 hooks in the 2001/2002 season in the legal fishery. However, poaching in the Southern Ocean remains a threat and the potential indirect impacts of intensive illegal fishing have not been studied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Patagonian toothfish fishery footprint in the exclusive economic zone of the Prince Edward Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien invasive species\nThe key biotic disruption to the terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa’s subantarctic territory is alien invasive species. These include 26 alien invertebrates, one alien vertebrate (the house mouse), and 18 alien plant species (many of which have become invasive). These species have severely impacted the ecology of the islands and caused alarming decreases in abundance of the indigenous biota. Three invasive plant species have caused major environmental impacts7, and are predicted to spread further on the islands with continued warming and drying. Sagina procumbens is one such invasive plant species, and has had the fastest rate of spread across the islands8 due to its wide ecological tolerance and ability to reproduce vegetatively and by seed9. Sagina procumbens increases the richness and abundance of invasive invertebrate species, indicating the interactive effect of invasive species. These terrestrial invasive species affect marine species that breed on the islands. Marine invasive species are also an emerging concern with some introduced marine taxa detected at other islands in the subantarctic region, but their impact at the PEIs is difficult to predict due to limited research in deep ecosystem types. Although the impact of many terrestrial and marine alien invasive species are an increasing concern, none have had a more profound effect than the house mouse (see Box 1). Eight alien plant species have been effectively controlled since 2012 and ongoing research is being conducted on these and other species to better understand their impacts and inform appropriate control measures7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Mice on Marion Island\n\n\n\n\n\nMice were accidentally introduced to Marion Island by sealers in the 1800s. Cats were brought to the island in an attempt to control the mice in 1949, but they were eradicated in 1991 because of their devastating impact on seabirds10. Without sufficient control mechanisms, the mice have become the key threat to the island, impacting terrestrial and marine species and severely disrupting the ecology of these sensitive island ecosystems. The rapid increase in the mice population is due to an interactive effect of the lack of natural control, alien plant and invertebrate species, and climate change2. Mice have impacted all trophic levels, initially depleting macroinvertebrate populations and seed stock and, more recently, predating on petrel and albatross chicks and eggs11,12. Alarmingly, since the first detection of mouse attacks on adult albatrosses was recorded in 202313, mouse wounds have spread rapidly on adults across the island14, with decreased breeding success of injured birds, and birds succumbing to the injuries. With 2.5 million pairs of seabirds breeding at the PEIs, they are particularly vulnerable to mammal invasions when aggregating in such vast numbers. Nineteen out of 29 birds species are at risk of becoming locally extinct if mice are not eradicated. This is in addition to the competition for resources and the direct impact of bycatch by fishing activity in their foraging areas. This highlights the urgent need for the planned mouse eradication.\n\n\n\n‘Scalping’ of a grey-headed albatross by mice (© Tom Peschak).\n\n\nThe burrowing activity of mice also directly impacts indigenous plants, even causing mortality in a keystone species, Azorella selago15. This is an ecosystem engineer cushion plant species on the island, without which many of the island’s biota would not be able to survive in some of the harsher habitats on the island. Furthermore, the mice’s excessive predation on terrestrial invertebrates has caused a considerable decline in the invertebrate-feeding, endemic black-faced sheathbill (Chionis minor), the islands’ only terrestrial bird16. The impacts of mice also have knock-on ecosystem level effects, such as decreased decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of heavy predation on the invertebrates that are an integral component of decomposition at the island17– thereby affecting ecosystem functioning.\nThe Saving Marion Island’s Seabirds: The Mouse-Free Marion Project has committed to eradicating the mice in a collaborative effort led by BirdLife South Africa and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment.

Since the mid-20th century, mean annual air and sea temperatures at the islands have increased by 1.2 and 1.4 °C, respectively – more than twice the mean global rate18– emphasising the islands’ global importance as ‘sentinels’ of climate change19.\nOn land, warmer air temperatures and more southerly winds have coincided with a considerable drying trend of the islands, with annual precipitation having decreased by 1 000 mm per year from the 1960s to 202020. This has directly impacted the ecology of many terrestrial taxa, which evolved under a cool and wet subantarctic climate. As a result, the island is following a similar greening trend to cold environments globally, where an increase in biomass has been associated with a change in climate20. Impacts on vegetation include range expansions of generalist native and invasive plant species20, especially to the now less waterlogged mires and to higher, cooler altitudes, as well as range contraction of more specialist plant species21, whose strong association to specific habitat conditions limits their ability to capitalise on the changing climatic conditions. Warmer and drier conditions have exacerbated the spread of alien invasive species and compounded their negative effect on native species, which is expected to worsen with continued warming and drying. Such fundamental changes in the terrestrial community have major implications for ecosystem structure and functioning at the PEIs.\nIn the marine environment, warmer waters and faster currents linked to the southward movement of the Subantarctic Front have become more common, reducing local productivity and changing the trophic structure and composition of benthic communities1. Decreased rainfall on land has reduced runoff of freshwater and nutrients into the sea, contributing to changes in local productivity and benthic ecosystems22. Epipelagic communities near the islands have changed in species composition, with Antarctic species decreasing and subtropical species becoming more common23. As the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts continue to migrate poleward, eddy generation at the South-West Indian Ridge is expected to decrease, reducing the advection of zooplankton and micronekton to the PEIs. These changes have implications for short- to medium-range predators such as Crozet shag, and gentoo, rockhopper, macaroni and king penguins – many of which have declined in recent decades.",

    "text": "Ecosystem Assessments\n\nEcosystem threat status (2018)\nA preliminary national threat status assessment, following the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework, was undertaken for the 29 marine ecosystem types (Figure 5). Criterion C1 (recent ecosystem degradation) was applied using the Patagonian toothfish fishery footprint. The extent of the fishing footprint was calculated for each ecosystem type, and the severity of the impact was estimated to be Moderate throughout. Ecosystems with 80% or more of their extent within the fishing footprint were categorised as Endangered, those with 50% or more were categorised as Vulnerable, and those with less were considered Least Concern. At this stage, the presence and abundance of indicator species for potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems was not considered in the assessment of threat status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Distribution of threatened ecosystems in Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone. The 5 terrestrial ecosystems are listed as Data Deficient. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each IUCN RLE category.\n\n\n\nSix (21%) of the 29 marine ecosystem types described, are threatened by fishing (Figure 5). There are five Vulnerable ecosystem types including the PEI Shelf Edge, Upper Slope and Mid Slope, which were threatened by historical fishing within the 12 nm territorial Sea (now a sanctuary zone of the Marine Protected Area). More than 65 % of the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Seamount and Upper Spreading Ridge are fished, making them Vulnerable. Only one ecosystem type is considered Endangered, the PEI Subantarctic Shallow Spreading Ridge, which has been fished over its entire extent. The remaining marine ecosystem types have been fished over less than half of their extent and so are considered Least Concern at this stage (Figure 5). Climate risks need to be incorporated in future assessments which also adopt a regional rather than a national approach.\nThe ecosystem threat status assessment for the five terrestrial PEI ecosystems was hampered by the lack of appropriate data on ecological condition and were thus assessed as being Data Deficient. These are national assessments and comprehensive regional or global assessment should remain the goal for these ecosystem types in future. This highlights the opportunity for co-operation with international partners to determine the distribution and condition of the PEIs’ ecosystem types beyond South Africa’s boundaries. It is possible that when the global situation is considered, some ecosystem types currently assessed as Least Concern or Data Deficient in the PEIs may change to threatened. \nWith biological invasion and climate change being the key threats to the PEIs, disruption of biological processes and ecosystem degradation is an increasing concern. There is a gap in our ability to understand thresholds of condition and there are challenges in measuring the subtler forms of habitat degradation in such remote regions. As a result, the level of modification of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, particularly the impact of demersal fishing on potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, may be under estimated. Better information on biotic disruptions (especially by mice, invasive plants and invertebrates) and environmental degradation (climate change and human impacts) are required for a meaningful assessment.\n\n\nEcosystem protection level (2018)\nEcosystem protection level is an indicator that tracks how well represented an ecosystem type is in the protected area network. For the PEIs, ecosystem protection level was computed by determining the proportion of each ecosystem type that falls within the protected area network. No ecosystem specific biodiversity targets have been set for PEIs ecosystems types and a fixed target of 20% was used. The categories for protection level are: Well Protected where the extent protected exceeds the biodiversity target; Moderately Protected where the extent protected is between 50 and 99% of the target; Poorly Protected where the extent protected is between 5 and 49% of the target; and Not Protected where the extent protected is less than 5% of the target. In order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category at least 20% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem protection target) needed to be within the portion of MPA in which no fishing is permitted (12 nm sanctuary and restricted zone AB); if this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nOverall, 86% of marine ecosystem types are afforded some protection by the MPA network (Figure 6). Ten marine ecosystem types are Well Protected (35%), 14 are Moderately Protected (48%), one is Poorly Protected (4%) and four are Not Protected (14%). All five terrestrial ecosystem types were categorised as Well Protected (Figure 6). As with the ecosystem threat status assessment, these are preliminary results that do not yet consider the regional or global extent of ecosystem types and better data on ecological condition could also affect future protection level assessments.\nTerrestrial ecosystems were declared a Special Nature Reserve in 1995, in terms of the Environment Conservation Act (No. 73 of 1989) and thus enjoy the highest level of protection afforded to any natural area under South African law. The PEI MPA is South Africa’s largest protected area across realms (169 966 km2 or 36% of the PEIs EEZ) and has a core sanctuary zone around the islands and one restricted zone (zone AB) in which no fishing is permitted (together making up 6% of the EEZ). There are a further three restricted zones in which fishing is limited (8% of EEZ), and a large controlled zone that accommodates the commercial Patagonian toothfish fishery (22% of the EEZ). Where fishing overlaps with Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VMEs) and threatened ecosystem types, additional measures are needed to protect these ecosystems (e.g. the Southwest Indian Ridge in the northern portion of the EEZ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Ecosystem protection level map of the Prince Edward Islands and surrounding exclusive economic zone. Terrestrial ecosystems, represented in white, are all Well Protected. The inset shows the number and proportion of ecosystems types in each protection level category.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the marine environment of the PEIs has been heavily exploited by the commercial longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish, the spawning biomass of which may only be a fraction of what is was pre-exploitation in the early 1990s. The establishment of the MPA was intended to contribute to the recovery of toothfish populations, as well as provide protection for vulnerable and unique species and habitats. The zonation of fishing activity needs to be re-examined and fishing effort needs to be reduced in restricted zones to improve protection of marine ecosystem types.",

    "text": "Understading key estuary pressure\nA brief summary of pressures is provided here with a description of each pressure, detailed the relative intensity of each pressure, summarised patterns in the extent and intensity of pressures, summarise biodiversity impacts of each pressure, and noting mitigation measures (1,2).\nKey pressure categories include (2):\n\nFreshwater flow modification impacts estuarine productivity and ecological functioning, affecting estuarine circulation and retention. It also impacts water chemistry (e.g., salinity, dissolved oxygen), sediment processes, and land-sea connectivity. In extreme cases, it can lead to type changes, causing closure of estuaries previously categorised as permanently open (3). Associated biological impacts include degradation of habitats such as intertidal mudflats, salt marsh, and mangroves. Changes in connectivity can impact life-cycle requirements of migrating species, and genetic exchange between estuaries and adjacent marine environment.\nLand-use and development refer to land-use such as agriculture, as well as hard infrastructure development such as harbours and ports. Direct effects include loss of abiotic and biotic habitat, changes in circulation patterns, disruption of erosion/depositional cycles, modified tidal regimes, premature mouth closure, water clarity, and declining primary productivity. Ultimately, habitat changes have cascading impacts on biota, affecting population size/biomass, community composition, and possible local extinctions. Habitat loss also reduces carrying capacity of estuaries, especially for higher trophic level species.\nInlet manipulations are driven by the need to enhance land-sea connectivity. Artificial breaching is the most prevalent activity in this category and isimplemented to alleviate back-flooding of poorly planned low-lying developments or agricultural land when the mouth closes (4;3). Reduced freshwater flow often results in increased inlet closure, higher sand bar levels, and increased flooding of surrounding environs (Stein et al., 2021). Closed conditions are associated with nuisance algae or macrophyte blooms in nutrient-enriched systems, with premature artificial breaching promoted as a mitigation measure. Premature breaching can alter seasonality in land-sea connectivity, while breaching at too low levels reduces scouring of accumulated sediment and organic matter, resulting in constrained tidal flows and shorter open periods. Inlet manipulation changes key hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes with cascading effects on primary productivity, species composition, and recruitment of larval fish and invertebrates (4). Inlet manipulation may also induce estuary type changes, e.g., changing temporarily open systems to permanently open systems (van Niekerk et al., 2020).\nPollution, specifically nutrient enrichment, results in excessive primary production and associated secondary impacts such as hypoxia (low oxgen) and loss of associated ecosystem services (1). Eutrophication results in loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, oxygen depletion, harmful algae blooms, imbalanced food webs, lower biodiversity, altered biogeochemical cycling, and fish kills. Pollution can change an estuary from a macrophyte-dominated to a phytoplankton- or macroalgae-dominated system. Toxic substances, such as trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (e.g., herbicides and pesticides), also pose significant ecological and human health risks.\nEstuaries function as nurseries and provide vital habitat for commercially important estuary-associated marine fish and invertebrates species (5). Fishing impact population size, biomass, sex-ratios, size/age distribution, community composition, trophic structure, and reproductive capacity. Depletion-driven declines in effective population size may also drive hybridization. Vulnerable life-history characteristics, e.g., estuary-dependence, ‘natal homing’ and predictable aggregations are amplified by anthropogenic pressures such as fishing, pollution, and flow modification, ultimately leading to recruitment failure or even extirpation.\nBiological invasions by invasive alien species pose an ever-increasing threat to estuaries causing ecological and economic damage. Alien species can alter abiotic and biotic habitats, change sediment/water pathways, nutrient/biogeochemical cycling, impact community structure and functions by modifying spatial and food chain resources, with direct or indirect effects on indigenous species. Economic concerns include reduced food sources, burrowing activities destabilising embankments, clogging of desalination/cooling water plants, and predation of commercially important species. Habitat degradation reduces overall estuary ecosystem resilience to alien invasive species such as invasive North American cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and Asian mollusc Tarebia granifera (6).\n\n\nFresh water flow modification\nMore than a third of freshwater flows to estuaries is now abstracted (36 900 to 24 800 x 106 m3/a). The most significant reduction occurs in the Cool Temperate region, mainly due to reduce flow to the Orange Estuary, which drains more than 60% of the surface area of South Africa. Followed by the Warm Temperate region, while losses in the wetter Subtropical region are less. Arid predominantly closed systems are most severely impacted by flow modification. These estuary types have a high sensitivity to flow modification, as they are in hot, arid environments subjected to high evaporation rates. Estuarine types supported by relatively large catchments, such as Large fluvially dominated, Predominantly open, and Large temporarily closed systems, also experience high to very high flow modification pressures.\nActivities that contribute significantly to flow modification include: run-of-river abstraction, dam development, alien vegetation infestation, return flows (e.g., wastewater and agriculture), groundwater abstraction, transfer schemes, hydroelectric schemes, and increased runoff from hardened catchment surfaces (e.g., urban development) (2). Of these, run-of-river freshwater abstraction, dams and weirs, and alien vegetation infestation are mainly responsible for decreasing inflow.",

    "text": "Approach\nTo estimate degree of pressure associated with flow modification, land-use and development, inlet manipulation, and pollution, ratings of related indicators in South Africa’s Estuarine Health Index (EHI) were applied (Turpie et al., 2012). The EHI considers both abiotic (hydrology, hydrodynamics and mouth condition, water chemistry, physical habitat) and biotic (microalgae, macrophytes, invertebrates, fish, and birds) indicators.\nEstuarine health is rated as similarity to natural (rated as 100) with pressure ratings correspond to: Low = &gt;75% similar to natural (Categories A - B), Medium = 75 - 60 % (Category C), High = 60 – 40 % (Category D) and Very high = &lt; 40% (Categories E - F).\nFor flow modification, the hydrological indicator, changes in low flow (60% of indicator rating) and floods (40% of indicator rating), or percentage reduction in mean annual runoff from natural, were used. For land-use and development, changes in physical habitat indicator were used to estimate degree of pressure.\nThe degree of pressure associated with inlet manipulation was derived from the hydrodynamic indicator, specifically similarity in inlet status. For pollution, a sub-indicator of water quality (scoring similarity in dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients and toxic substances) was applied.\nThe degree of exploitation of living resources (largely focused on fishing), was derived from a combination of the fish indicator rating, moderated by the nature and magnitude of fishing effort (e.g., number of fishers, traps, gillnets versus fishing rods and handlines); catch composition; and size/age distributions of fish in sample data sets. ‘Very high’ pressure was associated with gillnetting or fish traps. ‘High’ and ‘Medium’ indicated relative levels of recreational and/or subsistence exploitation. ‘Low’ indicated little fishing pressure, however, all estuaries reflect some impact of adjacent beaches and nearshore over-fishing. A few systems where no fish are found (e.g., hypersaline estuaries) were rated as ‘None’.\nTo assess the degree of pressure from alien invasive plants, data from various national databases were used and categorised into aquatic and terrestrial plants. Their presence was recorded across different reaches (i.e., lower, middle, and upper estuary), while the degree of pressure was estimated on a three-tier scale relative to percentage coverage of EFZ area: Low = alien coverage &lt;5%; Medium = alien coverage 5-15% and High = alien coverage &gt;15%. Data on microalgal and macroalgal blooms were also assessed using similar method.\nTo evaluate pressure from alien or extralimital (translocated) fish species-level information was used from2. In addition, unpublished freshwater fish species data and field observations were considered (2). A species list per estuary was compiled and fish grouped into to (1) egg and larvae eaters (Bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, Mosquito fish Gambusia affinis, Guppy Poecilia reticulata), (2) habitat altering species (Carp Cyprinus carpio, Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella) and (3) predatory species (Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, Spotted bass Micropterus punctulatus, Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus). Pressure rating for alien or extralimital fish were derived from the number and type of fish species present in individual estuaries, being Low = 1-2 species, Medium = 3-4 species, High = 5-6 species or 1-2 predatory species or Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus present (if translocated/ extralimital) or Very High = &gt;7 species or 3- 4 predatory species.",

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status assessment\nThe estuarine realm is one of the most threatened in South Africa, in terms of both number of ecosystem types and by area.\nAbout 59% of the 22 estuary types are threatened with 23% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered and 18% Vulnerable. Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.\nMultiple interventions are required to avoid further decline in health. These include protection of freshwater inflow to estuaries and the sea, restoration of water quality, reduction in fishing effort and avoidance of mining, infrastructure development and crops in the estuarine functional zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 IUCN guidelines for red listing ecosystems and drawing from previous estuarine NBA assessments.\nThe IUCN RLE (Ver 2) framework was applied and following criterion were assessed:\n\nCriterion A2b (current rate of decline in ecosystem extent); based on land cover change rates between 1990 and 2022 - projected forward to 2040.\nCriterion A3 (historical reduction in ecosystem extent), based on land cover 2022\nCriterion B3 was applied to the estuary types that occur at 5 or fewer locations - and for which there is ongoing decline defined as: a) between t1 and t2, fishing pressure shifts from M to H OR H to VH, OR b) PES class A, B and C extent declined by &gt;1%, OR extent of H and VH Fishing pressure at year of assessment is greater than 30% of type extent. This captures increasing or sustained gill-netting pressures, and steady decline in ecosystem condition as triggers. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D1 was applied using fishing pressure scores for each estuary. The scores were converted to an index 0-1 and aligned to severity rating (1 highest severity - 100%; 0 lowest severity - 0%). The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\nCriterion D3 was applied to the Estuarine Ecological State Class (PES) data such that severity of biotic disruption of &gt;= 90% was assumed for PES classes E-F; Severity &gt;=70% was assigned to PES classes D-F; Severity &gt;=50% was assigned to PES classes C-F. The rating applies to the whole type and is scaled by estuarine extent.\n\nEach of the 22 estuary ecosystem types were assigned to one of the four risk categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Concern. The highest risk category for these two criteria is selected as the threat / risk status for each river type.\nA more detailed explanation of the assessment method can be found at RLE explanation page.",

    "text": "Summary\nEstuary ecosystem types can serve as surrogates for ecosystem processes and enable predictions of biophysical characteristics. Understanding ecological processes and patterns associated with an estuary type facilitates an assessment of its resilience to anthropogenic pressures. This allows for extrapolation in data-limited environments Figure 1.\nThe estuarine classification scheme divided the biogeographical regions that characterise the South African coast into four major zones: the Cool Temperate (Orange to Ratel), the Warm Temperate (Heuningnes to Mendwana), the Subtropical (Mbashe to St Lucia) and the Tropical (uMgobezeleni to Kosi), with the latter being a new addition to the estuarine biogeographical provinces.\nAll rivers or streams with outlets to the sea were categorised broadly as estuaries and micro-systems. South Africa’s 290 estuaries are categorised into nine functional types, namely Estuarine lake, Estuarine bay, Estuarine lagoon (e.g. the groundwater-fed Langebaan system), Predominantly open, Large and Small temporarily closed, Large and Small fluvially dominated, and Arid predominantly closed. Micro-systems were further divided into micro-estuaries (42), micro-outlets, and coastal waterfalls based on spatial features and biotic observations in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Biographical regions\nThe traditional biogeographic organisation of South African estuaries has included only three dominant regions, viz. subtropical, warm-temperate and cool-temperate (Emanuel et al. 1992; Harrison 2002; Turpie et al. 2000). However, the tropical distribution of some species recorded in the Kosi and uMgobezeleni estuaries in the north, prompted subdividing the subtropical region and include a tropical transition zone in the north-east of South Africa. Both of these systems, albeit differing in size and function, are unique clear water estuaries on a small section of South African coast.\nKosi Estuary has uniquely tropical flora indicated by presence of the seagrass (Halodule universis) and mangrove species Lumnitzera racemosa, Ceriops tagal and Xylocarpus granatum that are found in no other South African systems (Van Niekerk et al 2020). Tropical species such as the Snake Sea Cucumber (Synapta maculate) and Pen Shell (Pinna muricata) (associated with H. universis) also point to a tropical influence on the system’s invertebrate fauna. The ichthyofaunal comprises a wide diversity of fishes, including tropical species not reported from any other South African estuaries (Blaber & Cyrus 1981). This is evidenced by the abundance and large sizes of several members of the Lutjanidae (snappers) in the system.\nTo the south, St Lucia Estuary supports invertebrate communities common in subtropical estuaries (MacKay et al. 2010). The Tropical zone aligns with marine biogeographic patterns evident for marine biogeographic map that includes the Natal-Delagoa tropical region (Sink et al. 2019).\nThus, the Estuarine Ecosystem Classification scheme defined the biogeographical regions as:\n\nCool-temperate from Orange Estuary on the Northern Cape to Uilkraals Estuary in the Western Cape;\nWarm-temperate from the Ratel Estuary near Cape Agulhas to Mendwana Estuary in the Eastern Cape;\nSubtropical stretches from the Mbashe Estuary in the Eastern Cape to the St Lucia Estuary in KwaZulu-Natal; and\nTropical from uMgobezeleni to Kosi Estuary in Northen KwaZulu-Natal.",

    "text": "What is an estuary?\nThe NBA 2025 defines an estuary as ‘a partially enclosed permanent water body, either continuously or periodically open to the sea on decadal time scales, extending as far as the upper limit of tidal action, salinity penetration or back-flooding under closed mouth conditions. During floods an estuary can become a river mouth with no seawater entering the formerly estuarine area or, when there is little or no fluvial input, an estuary can be isolated from the sea by a sandbar and become fresh or even hypersaline’ (Van Niekerk et al. 2020). A defining feature of this definition is that complex estuarine abiotic processes distinguish estuaries from other aquatic ecosystem types i.e. restricted tidal action, mixing of fresh and salt water, increased retention and/or increased water levels under closed mouth conditions.",

Examples of South African estuary types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstuarine lakes\nEstuarine lakes comprise one or more typically large circular water bodies connected to the sea by a constricted inlet channel. Maximum water levels are determined by berm height, mouth state and freshwater input. Marine connectivity varies from almost permanently open to closed on annual scales. Salinities are highly variable, ranging from fresh to hypersaline because of differing freshwater input (surface and ground water), evaporation and the extent of the marine connection. Mixing processes are dominated by wind and, to a lesser extent fluvial inputs, owing to their restricted mouths and relatively large surface areas. Average tidal amplitudes are negligible (15 – 20 cm) when connected to the sea, primarily due to restricted mouth conditions. Sediment processes tend to be stable, with infilling occurring over long time scales and resetting confined to larger flood events.\n\n\nEstuarine bays\nEstuarine bays are permanently linked to the sea by unrestricted, deep mouths and are dominated by tidal processes, with tidal amplitudes close to those of the sea. These are large systems (&gt;1200 ha) with generally round basins where only the upper reaches experience a degree of constriction to tidal flows. As a result of relatively low river inputs they have a predominantly euhaline salinity regime in the lower and mid reaches, with freshwater mixing processes being mostly confined to the restricted upper areas. Sediments are typically marine in origin and grain size distributions are stable. There are two natural occurrences of Estuarine bays in South Africa (viz. Knysna and Durban Bay.\n\n\nEstuarine lagoons\nLangebaan Lagoon has many of the characteristics of an estuary (Whitfield 2005), including calm waters that are protected from marine wave action and biota that reflect many of the species usually found in estuaries. However, despite groundwater seeps into some areas, it lacks surface water inflow and a normal estuarine salinity gradient. Langebaan Lagoon represents a unique coastal ecosystem type and is recognised as an estuary because its ecological functioning includes both freshwater and marine inputs into a semi-enclosed embayment. Estuarine lagoons, as defined here, are permanently connected to the sea and are therefore marine dominated. Tidal action is the dominant mixing process and sedimentary processes are thus generally stable. Tidal amplitude and water levels are close to those of the sea.\n\n\nPredominantly open estuaries\nThese estuaries are open to the sea for more than 90% of the time. Some are permanently open owing to perennial river flows or the presence of large tidal prisms. Tidal amplitude ranges from 0.75-1.5 m. Predominantly Open estuaries are linear systems in which mixing processes are dominated by both fluvial inputs and tidal action creating vertical and horizontal salinity gradients. Under low flows, hypersalinity can develop in the upper reaches. The degree to which the mouth is restricted depends on the rate and volume of freshwater inflow. Some systems become severely constricted during low flow periods. Regular flooding results in relatively mobile sediments. These estuaries usually support wetlands, salt marshes, macrophyte beds and marine and estuarine fauna. Surprisingly, their size varies considerably ranging from 10 to 7500ha, with smaller systems afforded a degree of protection against direct wave action by rocky headlands or subtidal reefs, which assists in maintaining an open mouth.\n\n\nLarge and small temporarily closed estuaries\nThe sizable temporarily open/closed category of Whitfield (1992) was divided into Small and Large temporarily closed estuaries using a total habitat area of 15ha (associated with ~10ha of open water area) as the dividing threshold. The division was based on differences in biophysical processes and patterns. Small systems are likely to experience rapid increases and decreases freshwater runoff over a few hours making them strongly event driven. There will be little scouring during breachings, and a semi-closed mouth condition can easily develop owing to a small, perched, outflow channel that restricts tidal amplitude to 10 to 15cm. There is minimal water column area during the open state. Habitat diversity is likely to be low (and without intertidal salt marshes) and species diversity and abundance reduced.\nBoth large and small systems tend to be linear or funnel shaped with highly restricted inlets. Smaller systems especially tend to be ‘perched’ above normal tidal levels, resulting in little to no open water area during the open mouth low tide state. Water levels are dominated by the state of the mouth, with highest levels of 1 m to 2 m above mean sea level during the closed phase. Tidal ranges are very restricted, varying from 25-50 cm in Large temporarily closed estuaries to 15-30 cm in Small temporarily closed estuaries. Open phase mixing processes are dominated by fluvial input and partially by tides. When closed, wind and seepage losses through the berm play a key role. Sediment composition is largely stable, resetting mainly during floods. Salinity regimes range from almost fresh to hypersaline, which in large systems can develop during times of low flow or droughts. Small temporarily closed estuaries tend to be fresher in character as they have less connectivity with the sea.\n\n\nSmall and large fluvially dominated estuaries\nSmall and Large fluvially dominated systems to distinguish between small (&lt;15 ha), black water dominated, rocky temperate southern coast estuaries, and large, shallow, sediment rich, freshwater dominated systems of the east and west coasts. The larger systems have very high sediment turnover, often develop ebb-tidal deltas, are turbid and can close during periods of low flow, e.g. uThukela and Orange estuaries. Small, sediment-starved, fluvially-dominated systems have unrestricted mouths as they usually occur along rocky shores and receive clear humic-stained water from Table Mountain Sandstone catchments. Large fluvially dominated estuaries tend to be constricted and can even periodically close during low flows. River processes are dominant and salinities are mostly fresh throughout the estuary for more than half the time. During peak flood conditions, outflows can influence salinities for considerable distances offshore.\n\n\nArid predominantly closed estuaries\nThis type comprises six small estuaries (Buffels, Swartlintjies, Spoeg, Groen, Sout (Noord) and Wadrift) located in the arid Namaqua west coast region. They are linear or funnel shaped and closed on annual to decadal scales. Salinities tend to be high to hypersaline (&gt;35) as a result of low fluvial input and high evaporation rates. Thus, mixing processes tend to occur over long time periods and are dominated by the effects of evaporation, winds and seepage. Occasional breaching and over-washing during high sea conditions provide for marine connectivity. Sediment processes are generally stable on decadal time scales and are reset by large intermittent flash floods. Water levels are determined by the interplay between sand berm level, evaporation rates and seepage losses. Groundwater and inflows from local fountains replenish these losses and influence the salinity regimes of these estuaries.\nArid conditions promote the growth of unique vegetation such as salt tolerant, succulent Sarcocornia spp. and Salicornia spp. thatcan flourish despite open water salinities reaching above 200. Fish relies on ‘suicidal’ recruitment that is largely a function of connectivity with the sea and overwash during high seas. Fish survival depends on groundwater maintaining salinity gradients and hypersalinity not exceeding 40 in parts of the systems. Invertebrate diversity, abundance and community structure are related to changing salinity gradients including long cycles of hypersalinity, e.g. Shrimp Artemia sp. that hatch at salinities above 40 and encyst when salinities exceed 150. Cycles of Artemia abundance follow salinity regimes that in turn affect the diversity, abundance and occurrence of flamingos and other birds that feed on them.",

    "text": "Estuarine ecosystem types in South Africa\nThe Estuarine Ecosystem Classification system for South Africa’s 290 estuaries are derived from interplay between biogeographical regions and estuary functional types, stemming from the country’s diverse climatic, oceanographic and geological drivers.\nEstuarine lagoons are the rarest South African estuary type with only one member in the Cool Temperate region, followed by Estuarine bays with two in the Subtropical and one in the Warm Temperate region. Arid predominantly closed estuaries are confined to six systems in the Cool Temperate region. The Large and Small fluvially dominated types comprise seven systems each, occurring in three and two biogeographical regions, respectively. Small temporarily closed (116), Large temporarily closed (93), and Predominantly open (45) are the most dominant types occurring across the Cool Temperate, Warm Temperate and Subtropical biogeographical regions. Estuarine lakes occur across all four biogeographical zones. While not numerically dominant, this type represents the largest surface area of all estuary functional types, with Lake St Lucia representing more than half of South Africa’s estuarine surface area.\n\nEstuarine ecosystem examplesData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Code blocks for graphs, maps and tables\nUse these code blocks to ensure that your graphs maps and tables are consistently numbered and labeled. Using these code blocks also lets you cross-reference tables and figures in the text.\n\nGraphs and maps\nThe #| label: line in the code below makes it possible to reference the graph in the text. It must always start with fig- for Quarto to recognise it as a figure, and to apply correct styling and numbering to the figure caption. Each figure in your document must have a unique fig- name. To reference the figure in the text, use Insert &gt; Cross Reference, and look for the figure lable in the list.\nAdd an appropriate descriptive caption next to fig-cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Add figure caption here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nFollow the same system for creating tables. Do not use the visual editor to insert tables, as this will create a table in Quarto’s default style, and you will have to type in the data manually, making the table less reproducible if your data changes. Note that here you must use the tbl- prefix to ensure that quarto recognises it as a table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Protected Areas play an important role in conserving representative and healthy functioning wetland ecosystems to ensure the continued existence of species and ecosystem types. However, inland wetland types are severely under-represented and under-protected in South Africa, with nearly 80% of wetland ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected.This is driven in part by poor ecosystem condition, as only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem target.\nAdd landscape photo. Umgeni Vlei Provincial Nature Reserve and Ramsar site, KwaZulu-Natal (Ⓒ xxxx)\nThe proportion of South Africa’s total wetland extent under statutory protection (i.e. in categories1 recognised under the Protected Areas Act) at the time of this assessment is x% (930 000 km2). Taking wetland ecological condition into consideration, approximately 5% of inland wetland ecosystem extent is Well Protected, 6% is Moderately Protected, 69% is Poorly Protected and 20% is Not Protected.\nAccording to wetland type, 8 (10%) of inland wetland ecosystem types are Well Protected, 11 (13%) are Moderately Protected, 41 (50%) are Poorly Protected and 22 (27%) are Not Protected. Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape. Well Protected wetland ecosystem types are clustered within the Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga, iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in KwaZulu-Natal, and across the Western Cape.\nTable 1. Ecosystem protection level and hydrogeomorphological (HGM) type for inland wetland ecosystem types.\nIn terms of wetland hydrogeomorphic type,depression wetlands have the highest protection level, with 33% of depression wetland types and 37% of depression wetland extent considered to be Well Protected, while only 11% and 10% respectively of floodplain and seep wetland types are considered Well Protected. No unchannelled valley-bottom wetland types are considered to be Well Protected.\nAlthough there has been positive progress in protecting inland wetland ecosystem types, the national protected area network could be strengthened to encompass a wider representation of South Africa’s inland wetlands and to afford protection to those that are Poorly Protected or Not Protected. Seventeen (20%) out of 82 inland wetland types are both threatened (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) and under-protected (Not Protected). They are found on the Highveld, along the eastern escarpment, in the Cape Fold Mountains and the arid Northern Cape.\nNote that the current wetland ecosystem protection level analysis is built on a robust interim wetland ecosystem typology and an automated WetHealth Level 1 applied at national scale for the first time. However, to ensure the most robust and defensible characterisation of wetland types, the National Wetland Map team is actively refining the typology into more detailed, validated subtypes in collaboration with multiple specialist researchers. This work is ongoing and may result in minor adjustments to wetland types and ecological condition, and an updated assessment in the near future.",

    "text": "Approach to assess this indicator\nEcosystem Protection Level [Harris et al. (in review)] measures the degree to which South Africa’s inland wetland ecosystem types are represented within the protected area [SA govt] network. While previous NBA assessments used a standard 20% target [Roux et al], the current protection level target was adjusted in line with Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, to assess whether 30% of each of the 82 inland wetland ecosystem types falls within a Protected Area [SAPAD]. \nImportantly, the current condition of the wetland is also taken into consideration in the calculation2. At least 30% of each wetland ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition (ecological class A or B) to qualify in the Well Protected category. If this target was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nThe four ecosystem protection level indicator classes were calculated as follows: Well Protected: 100% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; but only wetlands in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and wetlands in an A and B condition contribute 100%, wetlands in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition wetlands contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of an inland wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition wetlands contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a wetland ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition wetlands contribute 100%, C and D condition wetlands contribute 30%, E and F condition wetlands contribute 10%.\nNote that changes in the results since NBA 2018 reflect modest changes in ecosystem protection level, but are also due to expanded wetland mapping efforts and revised targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. In terms of the two key input layers for calculating ecosystem protection level, wetland ecological condition will continue to be reviewed against field-validated WetHealth specialist assessments, and updates to wetland ecosystem type is in process This will continue to be an exciting space for progress in the upcoming years. New results will be posted to this web page at key intervals and communicated to the field of practice. Application of the NBA wetland datasets in EIAs should always be supported by a specialist field assessment and, ideally, fed back to the National Wetland Map team to support the calibration of these datasets.",

    "text": "Less than x% of river extent is considered Well Protected, placing rivers among the least protected ecosystems in South Africa. A whole catchment approach is needed to bend the curve on river conservation, as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. Xx of rivers within Protected Areas that were assessed to be Poorly Protected due to their ecological condition may be prime targets for effective restoration.\nApproximately #% of the country’s river length occurs in protected areas. Of the rivers within protected areas, only #% of these were assessed to be in a natural or near-natural condition. For this reason, only #% of river ecosystem types in South Africa are considered Moderately to Well Protected1 while #% are considered Not Protected2.\nFigure 1. Map showing the river Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) and a donut plot summarising the number of river types in each EPL category.\nThe rivers of northern KwaZulu-Natal, Lowveld and Succulent Karoo are generally less threatened than other regions of the country. Protection levels are particularly low in the northern interior of the country, reflecting the spatial distribution of the current protected areas network.\nTable 1. Ecosystem protection level of river ecosystem types.\nIn terms of river geomorphological zone, only 16% of the river ecosystem types within the lower foothill and mountain stream zones are Well Protected. More than half of lowland river ecosystem types are Not Protected (61%), reflecting the bias of the protected area network towards mountain versus lowland areas. It is evident that formal protection does not guarantee biodiversity conservation as rivers are highly connected linear ecosystems that may be impacted by human activities throughout their catchment. A whole catchment and OECM approach, including conservation corridors, to river conservation is therefore required since most land-based protected areas were not designed to protect rivers.\n[photo]\nIt is encouraging that the extent of river length within the Protected Area network has increased by 10% / xx km [check] since the previous NBA analysis and that there is increased attention to rehabilitation of freshwater ecosystems within National Parks [cite] and Provincial Nature Reserves [cite]. While mountain streams have always enjoyed a stronger coverage than other river zones, it is [positive] to see an improved protected extent of lowland rivers as we strive to ensure that a well represented range of river types and geomorphological zones are conserved.\nRivers along PA boundaries are not considered well-protected.",

    "text": "Methods\n[Link to EPL_explained.qmd] Ecosystem Protection Level measures how well represented South Africa’s river ecosystem types3 are within the Protected Areas4 network.\nWe measured whether 30% of every river ecosystem type falls within a Protected Area. This is the current “target” we have set for our river ecosystems. This target is met if 100% of a river ecosystem type target (i.e the entire 30%) falls within the Protected Area network. The extent of each ecosystem type within the Protected Areas network is expressed as a proportion (target) of the total extent of that type. For the previous National Biodiversity Assessment (2018), the Ecosystem Protection Level target was set at 20% for freshwater ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Ecosystem Protection Level target has been increased to 30% in the EPL calculations.\nImportantly, the current condition of the river is also taken into consideration in the calculation. Ecosystem condition data [for each time point], was derived from the WRC-DWS Present Ecological State xxxx project. This allowed that only good condition river reaches were able to be considered as representative of Well Protected status; [while for MP PP and NP the condition of the rivers is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets - higher integrity / condition rivers contribute more to meeting PA targets than low integrity / condition rivers.]\nThere are four classes of protection and they are calculated as follows: Well Protected: 100% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; but only rivers in an A and B condition are considered to contribute; Moderately Protected: 50% to 99% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and rivers in an A and B condition contribute 100%, rivers in a C and D condition contribute 30%, while E and F condition rivers contribute only 10%; Poorly Protected: 5% to 49% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A&B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%; Not Protected: less than 5% of a river ecosystem type’s target falls within the Protected Area network; and A and B condition rivers contribute 100%, C and D condition rivers contribute 30%, E and F condition rivers contribute 10%.",

    "text": "Freshwater ecosystems – rivers and inland wetlands – are the lifeblood of South Africa, underpinning our water security, economy, and cultural heritage. However, more than 60% are in a compromised ecological condition. This places at risk the vital services they provide, and the incredible biodiversity they support. It is of great concern that the number of threatened freshwater species continues to rise.\nRivers and inland wetlands are among the most threatened1 and least protected ecosystems in South Africa. More than 64% of river ecosystem types and 65% of wetland ecosystem types are threatened (Key Message B2).\nOver 30% (82/222) of river ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected (Not Protected). Over 20% (17/82) of inland wetland ecosystem types are both threatened and under-protected (Not Protected).\nIt follows that the freshwater species which these ecosystems support are increasingly highly threatened.\nOver 36% of all assessed freshwater taxa and 66% of assessed endemic freshwater taxa are threatened, while 36% of all freshwater fishes and 66% of endemic freshwater fishes are threatened.\nFreshwater fishes are the most threatened of all taxa in South Africa. With escalating pressures from human activities and climate change, it is highly concerning that 59 waterbird species have been uplisted, with 5 listed as Endangered, 11 Vulnerable and the remaining Near Threatened, while the African Shaggy Rat (previously African Marsh Rat) and the Laminate Vlei Rat have been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened during the current assessment. This is the first time that freshwater invertebrates have been included into the national biodiversity assessment.\nIn the face of increasing pressures, South African freshwater ecosystems continue to degrade faster than the investment in their conservation, management and rehabilitation. Key pressures include disruptions to the hydrological regime, deteriorating water quality (Key Message A3), direct habitat loss and biological invasions (Key Message A4), as well as the exacerbating effect of climate change (Key Message A1).\nAs freshwater ecosystems are affected by land use within their receiving catchment (Key Message A2), they are not easily protected within nature reserves and, therefore, implementation of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs2), ecological corridors and connectivity3 is vital. We must collaborate across all levels of society (Key Message C1) to conserve and wisely manage our remaining intact rivers and inland wetlands, and the freshwater species that they support. We must take urgent action to increase attention and funding on freshwater ecosystems and species, and to implement restorative actions in strategically identified areas.",

The impacts of fishing need to be effectively managed to ensure sustainable fisheries that can support ocean life and livelihoods and pressure mapping needs to be updated and improved for more accurate assessments, especially at finer scales.

    "text": "Cumulative Pressures\nSouth Africa uses cumulative pressure mapping as a key input into the assessment of marine ecosystem threat status. A total of 31 pressures have been mapped to support biodiversity assessment and spatial planning1. These include historical pressures that may have ceased in some areas but have contributed to long term changes in ecological condition. Both the number and intensity of pressures is considered in cumulative pressure mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas have the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas with high cumulative pressures include most bays, the area offshore of the Orange River, the shelf edge off the west and south coasts, large portions of the Cape inner and middle shelf, the Agulhas Bank and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. The highest cumulative pressure in the marine realm was recorded in Saldanha Bay.\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which alter shorelines and circulation, increase urbanisation and access for fishers, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. New ports and harbours can have substantial impacts on marine biodiversity and livelihoods and therefore warrant careful evaluation in spatial planning and decision-making.\nSkein et al. (2022) examined 17 key pressures from 17 different sectors and their links to 23 key ecosystem characteristics (Figure 1) that have implications for ecosystem services. Fishing, petroleum (referred to as “Non-renewable (oil and gas)” in Figure 1) and shipping had the most widespread effects across the most ecosystem components, accounting for 30% of total linkage pathways identified, with fishing showing the most linkages overall. This is due to the extensive and complex nature of these three sectors, each of which comprise various components that may impact marine life in different ways. For example, offshore oil and gas sector activities include exploration (invasive and non-invasive), production and transport, each exerting different pressures on marine biodiversity. Anticipated renewable energy installations will have implications for marine ecosystems and species in future, through increased underwater noise, habitat modification and wildlife collisions, depending on the energy source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. South African marine ecosystem risk assessment Sankey diagram illustrating links among sectors (left), their associated pressures (middle) and the ecological components (right) that are impacted by these pressures. The width of the lines represent the Impact Risk (describing the exposure and severity of an interaction). Sectors, pressures and ecological components appear in descending order based on sum Impact Risk scores (Skein et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nPervasive pressures with multiple drivers (Cross-cutting pressures) include pollution emanating from industrial, municipal and agricultural sources, ocean noise associated with activities such as shipping, mining and petroleum exploration, light pollution from artificial light at night especially in coastal areas, and invasive alien species.\nClimate change and ocean acidification, primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, cause diverse and interrelated pressures that impact marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. Furthermore, by creating stressful environmental conditions (e.g. altered temperatures or reduced oxygen levels), climate change and ocean acidification increase the vulnerability of marine life to other pressures such as pollution or the impacts of fishing.\nThe indirect and cumulative impacts of expanding ocean activities need more attention in marine environmental management. Failure to account for potential cumulative and indirect impacts will preclude such impacts from being taken into account in spatial planning and decision-making, with likely negative implications for people and the environment.",

    "text": "Sector and pressure overviews\nPressure data sets are important inputs into spatial assessments and planning. Marine pressure data for South Africa is described in the 2018 NBA marine technical report1 that explained and mapped each pressure, summarised patterns in their extent and intensity, and reviewed their known biodiversity impacts, noting any known mitigation measures or relevant work that was underway. Drawing on the above and information that is available in more recent Marine Spatial Planning reports2,3, a brief summary of sectors and pressures is provided below (only references not previously cited in Majiedt et al. (2019) are indicated).\nIn general, updating and improvement of pressure data sets is required. Outdated pressure maps, pressure data that are missing or of a poor resolution, and inaccurate estimation of pressure impacts on ecological condition, all reduce the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and the efficacy of spatial planning. For example, missing pressure data in certain areas or for certain sub-sectors (such as small-scale fishing) omits key rightsholders and compromises integrated and equitable spatial planning. Long-term pressure data series are needed for ecosystem and species assessment (key message B5) and finer scale mapping for more accurate assessment of ecological condition.\n\nFishing\n\n\n\nSouth African fisheries provide food, employment and revenue and are making progress in addressing impacts on marine biodiversity. © Peter Chadwick, African Conservation Photographer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFishing incorporates at least 19 South African fishing sectors representing industrial, commercial, small-scale, artisanal and recreational fisheries, with a variety of methods employed to target a wide range of fish, invertebrate and seaweed resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFishing methods include trawling (demersal and mid-water), longlining (demersal and pelagic), purse-seining, linefishing, squid jigging, trap fishing, hand harvesting, beach seining, and wet and dry kelp harvesting.\nMore than 700 marine species are directly affected by fishing in South Africa4, with bycatch a key concern for trawl and longline fisheries. There have been improvements in managing incidental mortalities of seabirds, but bycatch of sharks, skates and rays is a driver of the threatened status of this group (shark species page) with work underway to support improved management2. More information on fisheries impacts on stock status or species threat status is reported in the species page for the marine realm.\nFisheries affect benthic and pelagic ecosystems through multiple pathways of impact5, with the impact of the demersal trawl and longline fisheries on seabed habitats providing a straightforward example (Figure 2). Measures have been taken to manage the ecosystem impacts of trawl fishing through freezing the demersal hake trawl footprint, new co-developed spatial management measures and work to identify and protect Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems6 (Sink et al. 2025 - the trawl report).\nUnsustainable fishing includes overfishing of target or bycatch species and fishing practices that can have severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Overfishing can include unsustainable total numbers of fish being caught and overharvesting of specific size or age classes that are critical for maintaining population growth and fishery sustainability. Some fishing gear types are known to incidentally catch high numbers of non-target species (bycatch or incidental mortalities) and/or to impact seabed habitats. Illegal fishing and ghost fishing from lost fishing gear are difficult to map and qualify, but these unsustainable fishing practices can have negative impacts on the food web (trophic effects) and lead to ecosystem degradation.\nAlthough industrial fisheries generally have greater and more widespread impacts on marine ecosystems and species, all sectors contribute to pressures in the marine realm. In terms of participation, the recreational fishery is the largest of all the fishing sectors in South Africa (460-550 000 fishers7). This and the high technical capacity8 of mobile recreational fishers dispersed across the coastline means that this sector has a significant impact on fisheries resources. Furthermore, the recreational fishery is currently ineffectively governed by inadequate policy and regulations and remains largely unmonitored and poorly enforced9, with high levels of non-compliance (~50%10) and poor environmental behaviours being the norm in many recreational fisher communities11,12. While some commercial linefish species have demonstrated recent recovery, many species, also targeted by the recreational fishery, remain overexploited2, especially kobs (marine species page) and some seabreams.\nThere is evidence of some pro-active, conscientious recreational fishers adopting voluntary catch-and-release and other best practices in a growing social movement of self-reform13,14. However, while there is growing acceptance of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) practice as an essential practice, there is a growing consensus that poor release practices can still contribute considerably to fishing mortality15,16.\nOverfishing can also impact genetic biodiversity of fishery species by reducing diversity and effective population size, compromising their resilience and ability to adapt17. A recent study highlighted the long-term evolutionary costs of overfishing of the seventy-four seabream Polysteganus undulosus which has suffered drastic decline in genetic diversity and effective population size18. Recent genomic studies on kingklip Genypterus capensis revealed three genetically distinct populations across southern African waters, with signs of local adaptation19, highlighting the need for sustainable, spatially specific, transboundary management. Similarly, the two African hake species (Merluccius spp.) both show low genome-wide diversity. Shallow-water hake (M. capensis) shows three structured populations across the Benguela Current region, while deep-water hake (M. paradoxus), previously considered panmictic, now shows a split between the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean populations20. Managing species with spatially distinct sub-populations as single stocks may further exacerbate their low genomic diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLethal shark control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has employed lethal shark control measures in the province of KwaZulu-Natal since 1952 to protect bathers from the risk of shark attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese measures, comprising gill nets and baited drum lines, are implemented to reduce the local or resident population of sharks in the vicinity of certain beaches, thereby reducing the probability of an ocean user encountering a shark. These measures are implemented between Richards Bay and Port Edward with 13.5 km of nets and 177 baited drumlines deployed in summer and 0.2 km of nets and 270 baited drumlines in winter (See Improvements in shark control measures). Biodiversity concerns associated with the shark control program include the overexploited and threatened status of several target and bycatch species of cartilaginous fishes (shark, rays, and chimeras), catches of turtles and marine mammal species (marine species page) and potential ecosystem effects linked to the removal of predatory sharks. Of the 14 species of large sharks regularly caught by the KwaZulu-Natal sharks board, 11 are threatened. All of the affected marine mammal and turtle species are listed as Threatened or Protected species under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act.\nLethal shark control measures add to the pressure on elasmobranchs from other fisheries, particularly longlining and trawl fisheries, but ecosystem effects from shark control programs are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. Historical and current nets were considered in the assessment of ecosystem condition, noting ongoing efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of shark control measures in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneBox 1. Improvements in shark control measures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has taken several steps to reduce the impacts of lethal shark control measures on marine species. These include reducing the average length of nets deployed per annum by 87% from a peak of 44.5 km in 1992 to 5.7 km in 2025. Nets have been replaced with baited drum lines in several areas and a seasonal targeting approach to reduce negative impacts while maintaining bather safety. Nets are removed during the annual sardine run in winter to reduce marine mammal entanglements and mortalities on sharks and other species. Experimental work on mesh size, acoustic pingers and other innovations to reduce impacts have also been conducted and there is ongoing research to improve the evidence base for shark management. Such measures have resulted in an 80% reduction in total catch and substantially reduced mortalities of sharks and other marine species (KZN Sharks Board pers. comm.). A network of researchers tag sharks and use satellite and acoustic tracking to better understand shark movement. Such data are useful in better understanding shark distribution and risks in terms of location, season and other temporal trends.\nOther provinces have implemented non-lethal measures that have little to no impact on marine life and these measures are not included as a pressure layer in this assessment. Local conditions affect the feasibility of different models with history of shark control, visibility, sea conditions, vantage points, launch site proximity and the local infrastructure and networks affecting options for shark control and bather safety. Bather exclusion nets and a shark spotter programme help protect bathers in Cape Town, while Plettenberg Bay has also implemented shark spotters and an innovative network to support bather safety (NSRI technology). Two other countries that have shark control programs recently introduced new non-lethal measures including drones to help detect sharks and smart drumlines that alert crew when an animal takes the bait so that they can launch immediately to free any bycatch and euthanise (severely injured) target sharks (Reunion Island) or translocate them (Australia). There are increasing studies that support the development and testing of shark-bite mitigation measures, however a lack of standardisation challenges effective comparisons of these measures21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal and offshore mining\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal and offshore mining is increasing in South Africa, targeting diamonds, heavy minerals and sand, and depending on the method of extraction, can have moderate to very severe negative impacts on biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpacts include habitat destruction and modification (including beach morphodynamic type), sediment suspension and increased turbidity, pollution, noise, changes in the distribution and feeding habits of species and the introduction of alien species. Ecosystems that are impacted include beaches and shallow and deep benthic ecosystems on the shelf22–24.\nSuspended and deposited sediments caused by operations decrease feeding efficiency of filter feeders and clog fish gills, while increased turbidity from mine tailings can reduce primary production with reported changes in community structure. The potential for phosphate mining to commence remains a concern because the impacts of this activity could severely modify large areas of ecosystems and could jeopardise the sustainability of fisheries. The cumulative impacts of mining are a concern with increasing mining activity along South Africa’s west coast and shelf. Currently, there is no marine biodiversity information in the National Web Based Environmental Screening Tool used when applying for environmental authorisation, and limited information for the marine realm in the biodiversity and mining guidelines. \n\n\n\n\n\nMarine petroleum activities\n\n\n\nPretroleum infrastructure on the Agulhas bank. © Lara Atkinson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMarine petroleum activities in South Africa were initiated in 1969 with more than 300 offshore wells drilled to date and ongoing exploration by seismic survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of petroleum activities span the impacts associated with exploration, production and transport. Petroleum production has been suspended at the Oribi/Oryx and Sable oil fields (Block 9 off Mossel Bay) and the F-A Gas field and satellites but field development plans are underway at the Ibhubesi gas field off Hondeklipbaai. While production has largely decreased in recent years in South Africa, exploration activities have expanded into deeper water (Figure 3) and there has been increasing concern about the negative impacts of seismic surveys, in particular, on marine species and ecosystems. This is because of the intense and widespread noise that these surveys generate, which can have varied, far-reaching and cumulative impacts on multiple species and ecosystem processes. A cumulative map of seismic surveys was recently compiled and there is some progress in planning for the integration of underwater noise into assessments and planning ((Sink et al. 2024 seismic report)). See Pollution section.\nBiodiversity impacts associated with drilling and production include habitat loss from infrastructure installation; chemical pollution from water- and oil-based drilling muds, noise and light pollution. These impacts can cause physical and physiological damage to marine organisms, disrupt feeding, communication and migration and alter species distributions and aggregations. Petroleum infrastructure including pipelines for transport can also introduce, provide refuge for and facilitate the spread of alien and invasive species. Oil spills, leaks and blowouts pose serious risks with the potential to cause catastrophic impacts to marine biodiversity by oiling marine organisms, degrading ecosystems, and disrupting ecological processes, while also causing health risks to people. The chemical dispersants used in cleaning up oil spills can also impact marine life, and in some cases, are considered more toxic than the oil itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShipping is a widespread source of pressure in South Africa’s marine realm and is a key source of underwater noise and other pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is a maritime nation with considerable ship traffic and one of the highest concentrations of cargo ship and oil tanker traffic globally. While shipping is the dominant form of underwater noise in the ocean, affecting a broad range of marine species25, there are also other environmental and biodiversity impacts, including other forms of pollution (e.g. chemical pollution, accidental oil spills, air pollution and other), the introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling, and ship strikes (collisions between vessels and large marine animals). South Africa still needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act which has been in Bill form since 2013. More effective management of shipping in noise sensitive areas such as marine protected areas, including by regulating the maximum speed of vessels, can strengthen protection by reducing underwater noise levels and the risk of collisions. See Pollution section.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal development, including port development, is a significant cause of pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems, leading to ecosystem loss, interruption of physical and biological process, and compromises in ecosystem resilience and services1,26–28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal development within the littoral active zone deprives beaches of the sand stored in dunes and reduces coastal resilience to storms, high wave-energy events and sea-level rise, increasing risks to coastal communities and infrastructure. Such development can require expensive artificial movement of sand or other coastal engineering solutions to mitigate downstream erosion. In addition to coastal development impacts, ports and harbours are the main points of introduction and refugia for invasive alien species, and activities associated with them contribute to ecosystem degradation from smothering, pollution, underwater noise and anchorage. Coastal disturbance is common at popular and accessible beaches (especially around access points), and includes trampling, dune destabilisation and disturbance of shore birds or other shore animals. For more information see the coastal page.\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe biodiversity impacts of mariculture depend on the species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, husbandry practices and environmental conditions at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture along the South African coast includes farming of shellfish or finfish and takes the form of land-based operations that abstract seawater, pass it through a culture facility, and return it to the sea, and sea-based operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages suspended directly in the sea and a limited number of estuaries. Little research has been undertaken on the impacts of mariculture in South Africa but local work has highlighted the risks associated with eutrophication and the introduction of alien species, pathogens and diseases that can be transferred to wild stocks. For example, high stocking densities could potentially result in the evolution of native pathogens (especially viral and bacterial agents) to which wild fish do not have resistance. As such, mariculture can impact on ecosystem services.\nCurrently, sea-based mariculture takes place only in Saldanha Bay and Algoa Bay in South Africa. High retention and therefore lower rates of flushing of pollutants or elevated nutrient inputs in bays are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts of sea-based mariculture operations in these areas. Sea-based mariculture operations are also known to alter predator behaviour and movement patterns by causing them to aggregate in the vicinity of installations, and may therefore shift predation pressure on wild populations with resulting food web effects. Although there has been little success in sea-based aquaculture of bony fish in South Africa, mariculture remains a sector of projected growth, similar to petroleum and shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater flow reduction\n\n\n\nFlow reduction threatens marine ecosystems, species and associated fisheries benefits. © Bronwyn Goble, Oceanographic Reasearch Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFreshwater flow reduction to the coastal and marine environment occurs when water is abstracted from rivers or dammed higher up in the catchment, and/or the cycle of an estuary has been disrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in freshwater, and the accompanying sediment that is vital to many marine biodiversity processes, failing to reach the sea. By reducing input of sediment that forms and maintain beaches, mud habitats and other unconsolidated sediment ecosystems, flow reduction leads to physical habitat changes including loss of beach and mud habitat, impacts on ecological functions and services including nursery functions, environmental cues, productivity, nutrient provision and food web processes. Potential reductions in key fisheries catches with associated negative economic impacts have also been reported in South Africa. A third of South Africa’s freshwater flow in rivers is estimated to no longer reach the ocean, including approximately two-thirds of the potential freshwater flow of the Orange River and nearly a third of that for the Thukela River (the two largest catchments in South Africa). Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated and coordinated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure (key Message A7).\n\n\n\n\n\nWastewater discharge\n\n\n\nWaste water discharge impacts biodiversity, the economy and human health. © Jean Tresfon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWastewater discharge represents a significant source of pollution and includes a range of inputs, including industrial and municipal effluents, brine discharges from desalination plants, effluents from aquaculture operations, and stormwater and agricultural runoff1,29–31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 3 billion cubic metres of waste is discharged annually into South Africa’s marine environment through estuaries and outfalls, with municipal wastewater treatment facilities accounting for a significant portion of this. Wastewater discharge impairs water and sediment quality, and causes changes in the primary producer and benthic invertebrate communities near discharge points. High organic and nutrient loading due to wastewater discharge causes excessive eutrophication, fuelling red tides, harmful algal blooms and anoxia, often leading to fish kills. Coastal groundwater discharge is similarly enriched by human settlements, impacting shore ecosystems.\nTypically, coastal water quality is substantially degraded near major urban centres, with greatest negative impacts in areas with weak flushing and long retention, in particular bays. Associated microbial pollution can also have serious health and socio-economic impacts. For example, poor water quality has resulted in beach closures and loss of recreational value and tourism income. See Pollution section.\n\n\n\n\n\nDredge disposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDredge disposal is the dumping at sea of accumulated sediment from dredge material leading to smothering, increased turbidity, decreased primary production and other potential impacts32,33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDredging is a key service performed by the Ports Authority as part of harbour management and maintenance, whereby dredge material is collected from harbours to ensure that ships do not run aground. The type of disposal methodology applied, as well as the quality of the sediment being deposited, may amplify or mitigate these environmental impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmunition disposal\n\n\n\nAmmunition disposal in the ocean poses several risks to both species and ecosystems. © Jana Ulrich.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAmmunition disposal was practised in demarcated areas of the offshore environment from 1970s until 1995, before the London Protocol (1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter) came into effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDumped ammunition can cause damage to or smothering of ecosystems and habitat-forming species; potentially detonate, causing localised destruction; and corrode, causing pollution and toxicity, especially from heavy metals. Elsewhere, there is evidence of munition compounds bioaccumulating in marine foodwebs, which is predicted to increase with time and with changes in ocean chemistry. Presumably, dumped munitions in South Africa have corroded over the past 30-50 years, but the impacts are largely unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy production\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRenewable energy production is important in achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts and supporting socio-economic growth in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) in South Africa includes offshore wind, wave, current and thermal energy sources. Although no MRE projects currently exist, there are plans for development, e.g. a floating offshore windfarm at Richard’s Bay and energy generation from the Agulhas current has been under discussion for several years. Depending on the energy source, potential impacts of MRE include habitat disturbance and loss during construction, changes in hydrology, localised upwelling and electromagnetic fields, collision risks with wind or current turbines for seabirds and ocean life and increased ocean noise. Wave and current devices may negatively impact marine mammals, turtles, and fish through collision risk, electromagnetic fields, and underwater noise, and marine benthic and pelagic habitats and communities could be impacted by changes to natural seawater flows and sediment transport. Small installations would likely have localised minor impacts but large commercial arrays could significantly alter marine systems over time.\nEmerging renewable energy installations include planned photovoltaic solar plants for Saldanha and Cape Town, and planned green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia) initiatives for Boegoebaai, Saldanha Bay, and Coega. Green hydrogen development requires extensive new coastal and marine infrastructure, likely including desalination plants, with associated brine discharge being an important environmental concern for coastal ecosystems. Other potential impacts include pollution from the production and transportation of hydrogen derivatives, like ammonia or methanol, which use catalysts and chemicals that could contaminate soil or water if not properly managed.",

    "text": "Cross-cutting pressures\n\nPollution (including underwater noise)\nPollution is a cross-cutting pressure linked to many sectors with chemical (including plastic), pharmaceutical, noise and light pollution all increasing. Plastic, both micro- and macro-plastic, is pervasive and has been recorded at great depths and distance from shore, although its main source is land-based pollution. Plastic pollution has impacts on many marine species through ingestion and entanglement, especially seabirds, turtles, sharks and fish. South African research is increasing and providing valuable insights into this global concern34–37, which recently has also been linked to the spread of alien and invasive species and identified as a vector for toxic metals38. Other common pollutants in the marine realm are heavy metals and hydrocarbons, especially in ports and harbours39,40.\nIngestion and bioaccumulation of microplastics, metals, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products and other organic pollutants in animal tissues potentially leads to their biomagnification in marine food webs30,34,41. This poses toxic risks to lower and higher trophic level biota and humans who consume them. Bioaccumulation of pesticides and herbicides in coral reef organisms is an increasing concern31,42, while high concentrations of metals, other chemicals, and pollutants have been detected in sediments (especially in ports and harbours), surf zones of popular recreational beaches and in sponges within submarine canyons. These pollutants have also been found in turtles and their eggs, seabirds and seabird eggs, fish, cetaceans, sharks and marine mammals.\nLight pollution or artificial light at night can negatively impact species and ecosystems by interrupting species’ natural circadian rhythms, changing night-time activity through either negative or positive phototaxis43,44. Feeding, breeding and resting behaviours are affected with impacts on turtle hatchlings and seabirds and beach invertebrates of particular concern27,28,43. For example, several beach species including the Endangered Cape pill bugs, Tylos capensis (nocturnal sandy beach isopods;27) are significantly less active at night when exposed to higher light intensities, which reduces their foraging time. Light pollution can also affect navigation of seabirds and cause grounding with risk of injury or mortality45.\nNoise pollution is an increasing concern, particularly in aquatic environments where sound conductivity is greater than in air and where many species rely on sound for prey location and communication25,46. Sources of sound include seismic surveys (Sink et al. 2024 seismic report), shipping traffic, bunkering47, various other commercial activities, and boating. Elevated underwater noise can cause direct mortality, lower immunity and increase health risks, change species distributions and disrupt foraging when predators, prey, or both avoid noisy areas, and disrupt reproduction, communication and social behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Cumulative map of seismic survey activity in the marine realm between 1980 and 2020 (Wilkinson et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine mammals and soniferous fish are particularly at risk, including commercially important species such as kingklip, recreationally important species such as grunter and threatened species such as dusky kob and Syngnathid seahorses and pipefish. Recently, penguins have shown sensitivity to underwater noise47. Although there are many known impacts from underwater noise, there are still many gaps in our understanding of these pressures48 and how they may translate into ecosystem impacts. It is recommended that noise sensitive marine areas are proactively mapped and used to inform marine spatial planning and management (Sink et al. 2024 seismic report).\n\n\nInvasive alien species\n\n\n\nMarine alien invasive species impact South Afirca’s biodiversity, ocean economy and coastal communities. Pictured is Carcinus maenas an invasive crab found in South Africa. © George Branch.\n\n\nInvasive alien species have profound negative impact on marine biodiversity with increasing numbers of introduced marine species in South Africa49,50. Alien species have the potential to displace native species, cause the loss of native genotypes, modify habitats, change community structure, affect food web properties and ecosystem processes, impede the provision of ecosystem services, impact human health and cause substantial economic losses. The main mechanisms of accidental introductions are ship fouling, ballast water and mariculture51, with increasing recognition of the role of petroleum infrastructure and recreational boating in the introduction and intra-regional spread of invasive species. The expanding aquarium trade is also a potential source of introductions. Preventing marine invasives and limiting spread is vital as research shows that eradication in the marine realm is not feasible. Key pathways, particularly ballast water and hull fouling, require monitoring52 and management action. South Africa needs to promulgate the Ballast Water Act that has been in Bill form since 2013, and invest in innovative methods and partnerships to reduce hull fouling and the resultant spread of marine invasives.\n\n\nClimate change\n\n\n\nCoral bleaching is a highly visible symptom of climate change. © Sean Porter, Oceanographic Research Institute.\n\n\nClimate change exacerbates impacts of pressures on marine species and ecosystems through multifaceted pathways, decreasing resilience and threatening coastal communities and livelihoods53–55. South Africa’s oceans are changing with increased winds, upwelling and cooling being observed in some areas, and warming in others51. Increased storm events, sea-level rise, intensification of current variability and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events have also been observed, and work is underway to support baselines to detect any potential changes in pH through ocean acidification56–58. The impacts of these changes have been documented across a wide variety of marine taxa including kelp, other seaweeds, foraminifera, corals, sponges, molluscs, crustaceans, copepods, fish and seabirds59. Reported impacts include shifts in the distribution of species and communities, changes in species abundance, altered behaviour, hybridisation, increased spread of invasive species, and long-term declines in fished stocks and copepods. Coral bleaching is increasing42 and there is a need to invest in coral monitoring to track reef health. South Africa’s three coral ecosystem types are now considered Vulnerable to ecosystem collapse and 34% of the 128 shallow reef building corals reported in South Africa have now been assessed as threatened (marine species summary page).\nClimate change does not act in isolation, it interacts with other anthropogenic pressures and understanding these interactions is critical for effective conservation and climate mitigation strategies to protect biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability60. The complexity and variability of South Africa’s marine systems, combined with multiple anthropogenic stressors, make future climate impacts difficult to predict, but there is high certainty that negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security and valuable economic industries will continue to escalate.",

The 2025 marine ecosystem assessment drew largely on the pressure data and information from the previous assessment61, in which Majiedt et al. (2019) comprehensively reviewed and mapped 31 sources of pressure (spatial extent and intensity where feasible) on marine biodiversity in South Africa. These included 19 fisheries sectors, lethal shark control measures, mining, petroleum, shipping, ports and harbours, coastal development, coastal disturbance, mariculture, invasive species, freshwater flow reduction, waste water discharge, dredge material disposal and ammunitions dumping. Climate change literature was reviewed and synthesised53 and invasive species research49 was also considered.\nLimited progress in pressure mapping was achieved for the 2025 assessment but seismic surveys and submarine cables were mapped for inclusion in future assessments and an improved, finer resolution demersal trawl fishing layer has been compiled62. The work towards an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for South Africa5 also improved the understanding of pressure on marine biodiversity and was a key informant in the 2025 assessment (Sink et al. 2024 seismic report).",

Threatened and under-protected ecosystem types are candidates for improved protection through MPA expansion or other spatial management measures that could be recognised as Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs). In addition to expansion of protection of these ecosystem types, it is important to improve ecosystem condition through flow restoration, reduced fishing pressure and improved ecosystem management.\nFigure 1. Threatened and under-protected benthopelagic and deepsea benthic ecosystem types.\nThe headline indicators of the NBA provide information on the pressures faced by species and ecosystems and on the progress made in protecting them. Combining the indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of marine ecosystems. There are 27 marine ecosystem types that are both highly threatened and under-protected. The highest priorities are the Critically Endangered Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic which is Not Protected and five ecosystem types that are both Endangered and Not Protected (Table x). This includes the Orange Cone Muddy Mid Shelf, Cape Lower Canyon, St Helena Bay, Cape Sheltered Rocky Shore and the KZN Bight Mid Shelf Reef Complex. Three ecosystem types are Critically Endangered and Poorly Protected; the Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf, Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge and Cape Bay. Endangered and poorly protected ecosystem types include several shore types in the Namaqua, Cape and Agulhas Regions, False and Walker Bay, Western Agulhas Bays, two ecosystem types on the southern KZN shelf and four ecosystem types in the KZN Bight.\nTable 1.

Improved bycatch management and diversified measures to protect bathers from sharks using non-lethal measures could help improve ecosystem condition in KwaZulu-Natal.\nThere is good progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of South Africa’s MPAs (Kirkman et al. 2021, 2023, Mann Lang et al. 2021, Sink et al. 2023), which reveal gaps in participation, cultural heritage protection and governance limiting progress in protection.

Advances in ecological effectiveness are evident but there are gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity and governance. Increasing extent of protection alone is not enough to advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected, as the condition of marine ecosystems in conservation areas also needs to be improved. Diversified conservation measures can help address gaps and provide new opportunities to safeguard both biodiversity and cultural heritage. South Africa needs to better include people in the design, implementation and co-management of conservation areas.\nFigure 1. Protection level map of benthopelagic and benthic marine ecosystem types.

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level results\nOf South Africa’s 163 national marine ecosystem types, 83% (representing 53.9% of the mainland marine area) are represented in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network to some degree, leaving 27 ecosystem types (17%) as Not Protected (representing 46.1% of the mainland marine area). While the majority of ecosystems have some protection, only 32 ecosystem types (20%), representing 1.4% of the mainland marine area, are Well Protected. It should be noted that changes in relation to the previous assessment1 do not reflect genuine changes in ecosystem protection level, but are due to revised targets and methods to improve alignment globally and among realms in South Africa. A table of the ecosystem protection level and threat status results can be downloaded from the Data section below.\nSouth Africa advanced protection levels in 2019 with the proclamation of the Phakisa MPA network. Of the 83 ecosystem types that were Not Protected before 2019, 67 types received their first protection in 2019 with the proclamation of 20 new or expanded MPAs2. These included 7 of 13 pelagic ecosystem types. Additionally, 18 ecosystem types advanced to Well Protected in 2019, going from a total of 9% to 20%. Since 2019, no new Marine Protected Areas have been established. However, protection for African penguin foraging areas has been strengthened through fishing closures around six breeding colonies3. In addition, new work is underway to support the recognition of Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), which may help diversify protection models3.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Offshore ecosystem types are still less represented in South Africa’s MPA network than shore and shelf ecosystem types. Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves are the most poorly protected ecosystem functional groups (Figure 3). Unless these functional groups are targeted for inclusion in MPAs or OECMs, gaps in representation will persist. However, while protection in the deep ocean beyond the shelf edge is less than on continental shelves and coastal areas, it should be noted that the deep benthic and pelagic ecosystems are also less threatened.\nIncreasing extent of protection alone will not advance marine ecosystems to Well Protected. The condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs needs improvement through collaborative efforts that more effectively address existing pressures. Furthermore, new activities that may conflict with MPA objectives should undergo thorough assessment and only proceed if they are clearly demonstrated to be compatible with conservation goals. Strengthened ecosystem management in protected areas can provide an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected.\nEcosystem types that are Not Protected include the Kingklip Koppies, the vast Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope, the expansive Southwest Indian Lower Slope and four pelagic ecosystem types. Among the latter, the Agulhas Retroflection and Southern Ocean Transitional Water is of particular interest as a globally unique area. The uThukela Canyon, the Cape Lower Canyon and St Helena Bay are also Not Protected.\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons cut into the continental slope off South Africa’s western margin. The Southeast Atlantic Lower Slope and the Cape Lower Canyon are both Not Protected ecosystem types. Coastal communities and small-scale fishers can contribute to offshore protection in South Africa and must be included in participatory processes to support new offshore protection measures © SANBI.\n\n\nOf the 27 Poorly Protected ecosystem types, several fall into this category because their areas that are within MPAs have high levels of ecosystem modification (i.e. poor ecological condition due to high past or ongoing pressures), not because they have very limited areas within MPAs. Among others, these include two kelp ecosystem types, Agulhas and Cape Kelp Forests, and two bay ecosystem types, Cape Bay and False and Walker Bay. Other ecosystem types that could advance from their current Poorly Protected status to Moderately Protected by improving ecological condition include Agulhas Mid Shelf Reef, the Agulhas Coarse Sediment Shelf Edge and Amathole Lace Corals.\n\n\n\nAn excellent area to improve protection of the Poorly Protected Eastern Agulhas Outer Shelf Mosaic is in the Seaview Horse Mussel Seabed Management Area near Gqeberha. This area has high biodiversity and Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys found clumps of horse mussels that were not observed in areas with greater inshore trawling activity © ACEP Deep Forests Project, Kerry Sink.\n\n\nForty-eight marine ecosystem types are Moderately Protected. While several of these could advance to Well Protected through improved ecological condition, 27 types will require increased coverage in MPAs or OECMs. For example, Agulhas Boulder Shore, Agulhas Rocky Plateau and Agulhas Upper Canyon require increased representation in South Africa’s marine conservation estate to improve their ecosystem protection level.\n\n\n\nAgulhas Upper Canyon requires increased representation in South Africa’s network of protected and conserved areas to advance to Well Protected © Lloyd Edwards and ACEP Deep Secrets and Deep Forests projects.\n\n\nOnly 20% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types are Well Protected. This statistic could be increased through increasing the estate of representative protected areas and by reducing pressures and thereby improving ecological condition within some existing MPAs. Well Protected ecosystem types include many from the Delagoa ecoregion where the iSimangaliso MPA and World Heritage Site provides protection to many ecosystem types. Other examples of Well Protected types include Agulhas Inner Shelf Reef, Natal Exposed Rocky Shore and seamount ecosystem types in the South east Atlantic.\n\n\n\nDelagoa Upper Canyon, which is home to at least 39 individual coelacanths, is a Well Protected ecosystem type. © ACEP Deep Connections, K.

South Africa’s Marine Protected Area network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, South Africa had 25 coastal MPAs covering less than 0.6% (6 260 km2) of the ocean around South Africa, up from 0.4% (4 711 km2) in 2011. The MPA estate increased significantly in 2019 and covers 5.4% (51 477 km2) of the ocean around South Africa. A map of the 42 MPAs in South Africa is shown in Figure 4, noting that the Prince Edward Islands MPA in South Africa’s subantarctic territory is the biggest of the South African MPAs and lies more than 1 700 km south of Gqeberha. No further progress in MPA establishment has been made since 2019. Learn more about South Africa’s MPAs at the Marine Protected Areas website.\n\n\nMPA effectiveness\nSouth Africa has made progress in evaluating the ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness of its MPAs4–6. These studies reveal gaps in participation, ecosystem representation, connectivity, cultural heritage protection and governance, among other attributes, which limit the ecological gains and effectiveness of the MPA network.\nCommon elements in these evaluations indicate a need to revisit MPA objectives for many MPAs declared before 2019, advance efforts to address historical injustices, strengthen social inclusion and collaboration in the design, implementation and management of protected areas and increase socio-economic research. Innovative transdisciplinary strategies in the co-design of protected and conserved areas and transparent and fair trade-offs in planning are needed7. This will ensure equitable governance and increased tangible benefits for rights holders, knowledge holders and people affected by protected areas4. Closer co-operation with fisheries, heritage and tourism could also deliver more integrated and effective protection7.\nAlsion box with Tsitsikamma picture\n\n\nOECMs\nThe concept of OECMs offers new opportunities for more inclusive and people-centred approaches to marine conservation that can encourage and support resource co-management, diverse cultural values, livelihoods and enhanced sustainability, while reducing the burden on MPA expansion in South Africa4. These areas are governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity values, whether or not biodiversity conservation is the primary management objective. No marine areas have been recognised as OECMs in South Africa as of December, 2025.\nExploratory assessments of various management measures that exist in the marine realm allowed for the identification of measures that hold most promise for OECM recognition. These included a marine buffer zone of a biosphere reserve, closed fishing areas adjacent to African penguin colonies, and estuarine management plans. Going forward, it may be strategic to prioritise sites under the above measures for formal assessment against OECM criteria.\n\n\n\nRemotely Operated Vehicle surveys within the trawl closure off Cape St Francis suggest that this area meets the OECM criterion for high biodiversity value. This site, if recognised as an OECM, could contribute to improved ecosystem protection level for the Endangered and Moderately Protected Eastern Agulhas Bay. © ACEP Deep Forests, K Sink.\n\n\nThere are certain measures that South Africa’s legislation makes provision for but are yet to be implemented, which could meet the criteria for OECM recognition, depending on where and how they are implemented. An example is special management areas under the National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act. Sites under this measure can be designated primarily for cultural purposes and could potentially constitute OECMs that uphold cultural sustainability, promote the connection of people with their environment and heritage, and facilitate greater inclusivity in marine conservation and management in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneBox 1. Cuturally Significant Areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Sites such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation relevance and recognition as OECMs in partnership with value holders. © Kerry Sink.\n\n\nNew research8 has supported progress in identifying and characterising cultural heritage sites in Marine Spatial Planning and coastal management. Eight categories of Culturally Significant Areas were identified drawing from literature, orature and expert knowledge8. These cover tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage, including iconic seascapes, traditional fishing grounds, sites of spiritual and ceremonial importance and oral tradition. Spatial management in alignment with OECM criteria could help to safeguard the deep and diverse cultural ties many South Africans have to the coastal and marine environment. The establishment of small scale fishing zones, a provision under the Marine Living Resources Act, could also be explored as a mechanism for OECM recognition, providing protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding marine ecosystems and cultural heritage9.\nImproving marine ecosystem protection requires strategic collaborative expansion of protected and conserved areas, but also actions to improve ecosystem condition and compliance in existing MPAs, including management and restorative justice steps.",

Schematic to show steps in determining marine ecosystem protection level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history and approach to the development of South Africa’s protection level assessment is provided on the ecosystem protection level explainer page and will be published10. The 2025 ecosystem protection level assessment for marine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets (Figure 5). While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% marine target with an additional rule applied, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target for all ecosystem types. When calculating the percentage of area within an MPA, the area contributions were scaled by condition to account for the fact that areas of high modification do not contribute to an ecosystem’s protection level as much as areas of natural condition. The protection contribution was scaled in alignment with the IUCN RLE criteria C and D thresholds of modification. Further, in order for a marine ecosystem type to qualify for the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural or near natural ecological condition. If this rule was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected.\nChanges in ecosystem protection level between 2018 and 2025 are caused by the increased target and improved methodology rather than genuine changes in protection or ecological condition. Note that OECMs will contribute to ecosystem protection level once these have been recognised in the marine realm3,9.\nRecent evaluations of ecological, socio-economic and governance effectiveness for existing MPAs were synthesised to distil key findings beyond the spatial analysis of ecosystem protection level. Synergies in underlying themes related to effectiveness and in recommendations to improve effectiveness or the evaluation thereof were identified. An analysis of stakeholder comments that was undertaken to inform future MPA expansion efforts was also consulted11 and the work undertaken through the iAtlantic project2,12, Mission Atlantic project13, the ACEP Deep Connections and One Ocean Hub projects14,15 including the Aliwal Shoal Working Group16, and SeaPeople17 were additional key informants. Inputs from an additional workshop that discussed the draft results of the 2025 marine assessment and co-developed recommended priority actions, also provided useful insights18.",

The ecological condition map for the marine realm was not updated for the 2025 NBA although some pressure updates have been underway. The first ground-truthing of marine ecosystem condition shows that pressure mapping is an effective proxy at broad national scales, but that finer scale pressure mapping can improve condition estimates. Increased monitoring is needed to support more accurate assessments of ecological condition (Link to KMC2).\nThe marine realm has a relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (~x%; Figure 1, Figure 2), similar to the terrestrial realm. In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact.\nPort photo?\nMining photo?\nMining, coastal development, trawling and mariculture have the highest impact scores among the 31 pressures included in the and led to poor ecological condition in some areas. Fishing is the greatest cause of degradation in the offshore environment, whereas coastal development and fishing are the greatest drivers of poor condition in inshore ecosystems. Flow reduction, waster water discharge and lethal shark control measures also drive poor condition in some areas.\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which increase access for fishing, alter shorelines and circulation, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. Port and harbour location therefore warrants careful consideration. Areas of poor ecological condition include parts of the southwest Atlantic shelf edge and the inner shelf of much of the western Cape, and parts of the south coast and shelf and KwaZulu-Natal Bight (Figure 1).\nRestored flows, improved bycatch and waste water management and further reductions of lethal shark control measures could improve ecological condition in parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight.\nImproved bycatch management, and … measures to protect bathers from sharks using non-lethal measures could help improve ecosystem condition in KwaZulu-Natal.",

In the marine realm, a total of 31 mapped pressure layers were used to assess ecological condition (Sink et al. 2018 threat chapter) using an ecosystem pressure matrix. The ecosystem pressure matrix was developed using expert scoring supported by literature and the synthesis of information regarding the impacts of marine pressures (link to pressure section). A guided group consensus method was used to score “functional impact” and “recovery”, simplified from an existing method (Teck et al. (2010) for each pressure and Ecosystem Functional Group. Impact scores reflect the equal weighted average of the functional impact and recovery scores for different broad ecosystem groups per pressure. Condition of an ecosystem at a site (30 x30 m pixels) was classified based on the cumulative impact scores at that site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Threat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nIn 2016, South Africa assessed 2214 spider species for the first time using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, which measure extinction risk2. Only South African species were included; Eswatini and Lesotho were excluded from the assessment. Of the assessed species, 78 (4%) were threatened with extinction: 23 are Critically Endangered (CR), 24 are Endangered (EN), and 31 are Vulnerable (VU). No species were found to be extinct or possibly extinct.\nHighly threatened spiders occur in the three major urban centers of South Africa (Western Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal major metropolitan areas). This could be an indication of sample bias, but also identifies areas that have lost large areas of habitat to urban expansion (Figure 1). Some species have very restricted ranges but face no anthropogenic threats. These are listed under South Africa’s national rarity categories: Rare (extent of occurrence &lt;500 km²) or Critically Rare (known from a single location). Sixteen species were classified as Critically Rare and 44 species as Rare. Although such species qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system, they remain a priority for national conservation and are included as taxa of conservation concern along with threatened, Near Threatened and Data Deficient species.\nMost species (1419; 63%) are widespread, face no known threats, and are assessed as Least Concern (Figure 2). A large proportion (675; 30%) are Data Deficient, highlighting the need for more research, particularly providing more detailed taxonomic descriptions, describing unknown sexes and providing additional distribution data through field sampling and examination of museum material (Box 1).\nEndemism is high, with 1325 species (59%) found only in South Africa, representing 2% of global spider diversity. Of the 72 spider families recorded, Salticidae (jumping spiders) is the most species-rich (354), followed by Gnaphosidae (195) and Thomisidae (143)1. Because of its size, Salticidae also has the highest number of threatened (6) and Data Deficient (98) species.\nHowever, the greatest conservation concern lies with smaller, cryptic species in isolated habitats such as caves and fragmented habitats. Families such as Pholcidae, Archaeidae, and Corinnidae each include four threatened species. Families with the highest numbers of Rare or Critically Rare species are Pholcidae (18), Salticidae (5) and Drymusidae (4)2.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA) was initiated in 1997, with the main aim of documenting the arachnid fauna of South Africa at a national level and to unify and strengthen biodiversity research on the spiders of South Africa3. SANSA was managed by the Arachnida Unit at the National Collection of Arachnida (NCA) at the ARC – PHP in Pretoria, with support from the Universities of the Free State and Venda, the National Museum in Bloemfontein, and the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) Threatened Species Programme, who funded SANSA phase 23.\nThe primary objective of the SANSA Phase 1 (1997–2005) was to consolidate all existing spider data into a MySQL relational database developed at the ARC. The study of South African spiders was significantly influenced by colonial expansion and the visits of scientists, who dispatched hundreds of specimens to museums in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The data date back to 1781, when the first species was described from South Africa. Records of all known South African species with their distribution were extracted from original descriptions, re-descriptions and revisionary work, as listed on the World Spider Catalogue. SANBI joined the project for its second phase, known as SANSA II, from 2006 to 2010. Gap analyses were done to determine the spatial coverage of the species, and targeted surveys were undertaken in degree squares throughout South Africa in particular areas with poor historic coverage. Due to extensive fieldwork by SANSA field managers and research from other projects, student projects and public participation, more than 40 degree-squares were sampled in previously poorly sampled areas, providing valuable material that improved our knowledge of species distributions and yielding valuable specimens for future taxonomic studies. In 2010, the First Atlas of South African Spiders (FASSA) was published online, listing 2003 species from 70 families, with georeferenced records and distribution maps4. The last decade, however, has seen considerable growth in the knowledge of spiders in South Africa, and the number of species known from the country has increased to 2265 species1. Even after retiring from the ARC-PHP, Dr Dippenaar-Schoeman still continues to work on the SANSA project as the project manager, updating taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\nThe National Collection of Arachnida - The cabinets housing the specimens in the National Collection of Arachnida. © Robyn Lyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFogging trees at Lajuma, Limpopo province to sample arachnids in the tree canopy. © Elsa van Niekerk\n\n\n\n\n\nSANBI para-ecologists sampling at the Makana Botanical Gardens, Grahamstown, Eastern Cape Province. © Robin Lyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends (RLI)\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index(RLI)5. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e., if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern, and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The RLI value for spiders in South Africa was calculated in 2020 and included 2214 species. The RLI value is 0.994, and relative to other taxon groups assessed in South Africa, spiders have the highest RLI value (Figure 4). Since only one assessment has been conducted for spiders, it is not possible to determine the trend in extinction risk for this group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for spider species assessed in South Africa, relative to other taxon groups. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The steeper the slope the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). Spiders are indicated in purple and have a relatively high RLI value indicating that levels of extinction risk are low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nSpiders face an array of threats—both natural and human-driven (Figure 4). Research has shown that habitat loss caused by fire, overgrazing and invasive alien species infestations has a direct impact on spider populations, causing local losses3. Agriculture, forestry, and mining are the leading causes of habitat loss for spiders. This is especially critical for ground-dwelling and endemic species with poor dispersal abilities. In South Africa, many spider species are highly localised and endemic to specific biomes, such as the Fynbos6, with 28% endemic species to this biome, and the Savanna7, with 30% of the species endemic. Ground-dwelling spiders are particularly vulnerable to changes in their habitat and often struggle to recolonise areas after disturbance due to their limited dispersal capabilities, making them more prone to local extinction.\nSpiders are present in relatively high numbers in agroecosystems; however, it has been shown that they are negatively impacted by pesticide use8. Thus far, 51 families from 413 species have been recorded from crops in South Africa, and five agrobiont species have been identified that play an important role as natural control agents of pests. However, chemical use can directly kill spiders or disrupt their prey base. Integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming are recommended to reduce chemical exposure that harms spiders and their prey. Altered temperature and rainfall patterns (climate change) can affect spider distribution, reproduction, and prey availability, and they may be severely impacted by drought.\nSome spiders are threatened due to poaching and are used as pets, for example, the species in the Theraphosidae family (baboon spiders). Regulations need to be enforced to prevent the overcollection of charismatic species like baboon spiders for the pet trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s spider taxa. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Spider species’ ability to respond to fire events, a natural ecological process, which is expected to become much more frequent and unpredictable in a changing climate.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the studies of spider ecology in South Africa are local-scale studies focusing on spider assemblage responses to habitat complexity, landscape-scale variables, ecosystem rehabilitation and plant invasions, and disturbance effects such as fire10, grazing11, invasive plants12 and chemical control13.\nFire is a factor that can significantly impact spider populations, but its effects vary depending on the species, habitat, and intensity of the fire. Many foliage-dwelling spiders perish during fires due to direct exposure to heat and flames, but some ground-dwellers that remain in their burrows (particularly trapdoor spiders) or that seek shelter under rocks or in cracks in the soil are less impacted. Due to habitat disruption, fire alters leaf litter, vegetation and microhabitats that spiders rely on for shelter and hunting. A study in central South African grasslands found that fast-burning spring fires resulted in an immediate sharp decline in ground-dwelling spider numbers, but that assemblages recovered to levels comparable to unburnt sites within a year. Burnt sites had significantly fewer individuals and species compared to unburnt ones. Some families, such as Lycosidae (wolf spiders) and Gnaphosidae (ground spiders), persisted post-fire, while others declined. Caponiidae (lungless spiders) were the only group found to increase in burnt areas. Studies have shown a decline in overall spider numbers after fire events. There are species-specific responses, and web builders (such as orb and sheet weavers) are more vulnerable and often absent after a fire, while ground hunters and ambush predators tend to be more resilient. Some spiders can recolonise burned areas relatively quickly, depending on the severity of the fire and the condition of the surrounding habitat. Fires that burn unevenly leave refuges that aid in faster recovery10\n\n\n\n\nVeld fire in the grassland and savannah systems. © Robin Lyle",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nA significant portion of the South African spider fauna remains undescribed. In the Cape Floristic Region, 24% of species are classified as Data Deficient, and two families (Synotaxidae and Theridiosomatidae) are only known from undescribed species. Studies on mygalomorph trapdoor spiders (e.g., Stasimopus, Ancylotrypa, Galeosoma) show taxonomic resolution as low as 15–29%, indicating high uncertainty in species delimitation.\nSampling bias and geographic gaps are a concern. Spider records are heavily concentrated in the eastern and coastal regions of South Africa, with North West, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga province remaining undersampled2 114. These sampling biases impede conservation assessments and ecological modelling.Making use of citizen science to contribute to observation both helps fill sampling gaps and also raises awareness (Box 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Calling all citizen scientists!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo contribute to the future Red List assessments and monitoring of spiders, join iNaturalist!\n\nSpiders of South Africa iNaturalist\n\n New to iNaturalist (or never heard of it) and want to play along? Watch these video tutorials to get started, and sign up on the iNaturalist website or download the app on your smartphone.\nTo see how valuable your nature photographs can be, watch this inspiring TED talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphological variation is poorly understood due to limited sampling, making it difficult to confidently define species boundaries. Despite SANSA’s efforts, many natural history collections lack comprehensive coverage or standardised metadata, limiting their utility for taxonomic synthesis, as large numbers of specimens in collections remain unidentified due to a lack of spider taxonomists. For example, a recent meta-analysis of South African spider data from seven collections found that only slightly more than half of the ~121 000 records had been identified to species level, indicating a major taxonomic gap in the available data14. Presently, there is only one spider taxonomist employed at a natural history collection. The shortage of taxonomic expertise will have direct consequences for resolving Data Deficient taxa and developing taxonomic products related to species descriptions, revisions, and the integration of molecular tools.\nAddressing the taxonomic impediment for spiders in South Africa requires a multi-pronged strategy that blends capacity building, infrastructure development, and policy integration. Here is a breakdown of effective solutions:\n\nExpansion of taxonomic capacity, by creating employment for specialist taxonomists and providing the required skills transfer opportunities (Box 4).\nAccelerate species descriptions through building capacity and collaborative research, particularly with international partners.\nIntegrate molecular tools and promote DNA barcoding and phylogenetics to resolve species boundaries, especially in morphologically conservative groups.\nDevelop a national spider barcode reference library, linked to voucher specimens and ecological metadata. Currently, sequence data on South African spiders (~10 600 specimens processed, mainly COI-5P) is scattered among several projects with very contrasting levels of taxonomic resolution.\nDigitize and standardise collections: with high-resolution imaging, georeferencing, and standardized metadata.\nEnsure the SANSA database evolves to be more accessible by creating a centralized database accessible to researchers, conservationists, and policymakers.\nEncourage citizen science platforms like iNaturalist to crowdsource observations and expand distribution data (Box 3).\nRelax permit conditions so that members of the public can sample specimens without fear of prosecution, particularly those linked to photographic observations, to enable species-level identifications.\nLink taxonomic work to spatial tools for species conservation, e.g. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and the DFFE Screening tool for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) to justify funding and urgency. This can be further linked to understanding biodiversity data and the role it could play in South Africa’s biosecurity with regards to emerging pests and diseases.\nFoster international collaboration, partner with global arachnological networks for training, data sharing, and joint revisions.\nInvite and fund visiting taxonomists to work on South African material and co-author species descriptions.\nFacilitate the training of taxonomists from other African countries to expand the skills base on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Profile on Data Deficient spiders of South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough South Africa has the richest described spiders on the continent that has been researched the most thoroughly in the past, many families have never been subjected to revision and continue to present a considerable identification challenge to taxonomists and ecologists alike. Surveys and research have shown that in several families, a large proportion of species remain undescribed. For example, the National Collection of Arachnida has around 45% of specimens that are still unidentified.\nPreliminary research on the following families reveals that many species remain unidentified.

    "text": "Approach\nThe first IUCN Red List assessment of South African spiders was conducted between 2016 and 2019, as a collaborative project between the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), the Agricultural Research Council, the University of the Free State and the University of Venda (formerly University of Limpopo). This assessment represents a pioneering effort in applying IUCN Red List criteria to a mega-diverse invertebrate group and was made possible through the 22-year South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA) initiative, which resulted in significant improvements to the knowledge base: a 33% increase in described species and a 350% rise in specimen accessions in the ARC’s National Collection of Arachnida (NCA).\nData Sources and Methods\nThe assessment utilized data from the First Atlas of South African Spiders4, which compiled information from two primary sources: the National Collection of Arachnida (NCA) at the Agricultural Research Council – Plant Health and Protection (ARC-PHP) in Roodeplaat, Pretoria (with over 60,000 records) and published taxonomic literature from 17 museum collections.\nThe distribution of occurrence records across South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland was visualized using quarter-degree, degree-square and density kernel plots for all 76,069 records. However, records in the NCA that were not identified to species level were excluded from the Red List assessments, reducing the analytical dataset to 23,827 species-level records covering 2,253 known South African spider species.\nCalculation of parameters\nThe calculation of Red List parameters was performed using the R package red (v1.6.3)15. Spatial analyses on observed occurrences used functions for calculating Extent of Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and elevational range. EOO was calculated as the minimum convex polygon around all occurrences, while AOO was determined by the number of 2 km² cells occupied. When EOOs were smaller than the AOO, they were made equal. Assessments were drafted as per the IUCN documentation standards and reviewed by relevant experts.\nAssessment Criteria and Limitations\nNotably, all Red List assessments relied exclusively on IUCN criteria B (geographic range) or D (population size), as these could be evaluated from available distribution data and inferred threats. The other IUCN criteria (A, C, and E) require empirical evidence of population dynamics and trends—a critical data gap known as the Prestonian shortfall—which remains unavailable for most spider species. This methodological constraint highlights the need for long-term monitoring programs to provide insights into population dynamics.\n\nRecommended citation\nDippenaar-Schoeman, A., Lyle, R., Raimondo, D.C., Sethusa, T., Foord, S., Haddad, C., Lotz, L., Hendricks, S.E., & Van Der Colff, D. 2025.

    "text": "Key findings\n\nSouth Africa’s flora shows very high levels of species diversity and endemism: 13,642 of the 20,248 taxa (67%), with high concentration in the Fynbos biome.\n1 in 5 endemic taxa are threatened.\nTrends in species status over time were assessed using a representative sample of 900 plant taxa, revealing an increase in extinction risks. Plants threatened with extinction increased by 2% between 2017 and 2024.\nDeclining trends are driven mainly by habitat loss and further intensified by invasive species, illegal harvesting, and the intensifying impacts of climate change.\nProtected area expansion has improved plant protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Density of threatened plant species (10 x 10 km grid) based on a representative sample of 900 species. Highest concentrations occur in the Cape Floristic Region — a global biodiversity hotspot with exceptional richness and high levels of threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nSouth Africa has assessed the threat status of 20,248 indigenous plant species using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species categories and criteria, which reflect a species’ risk of extinction. The Red List includes several extinct categories, three threatened categories - Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) - as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD), and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range- restricted endemic species with a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km² that occur in areas with no significant anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are prioritized for national conservation interventions, even if they qualify as Least Concern under the IUCN system. \nAmong assessed taxa, 0.2% (36) are extinct or possibly extinct, and 15% (3,195) are threatened. The country also has high endemism, with 13,648 taxa (67%) found only in South Africa. \nGiven this exceptional diversity and high levels of threat, monitoring all species is not practical. To track trends in extinction risk and identify the pressures driving these risks, a representative sample of 900 plant taxa was used. Of the assessed sample taxa, 17% taxa are threatened with extinction (Figure 3 C).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Threat status of South African plant taxa, here represented by a representative sample of 900 plant species; categories follow the IUCN 3.1 Red List Categories and Criteria with an additional national category of Rare added for range-restricted, localised endemics that are not declining.

Conservation interventions for medicinal plants reversing extinction risk trends (Warbrugia salutaris).\n\n\n\n\n\nA pioneering conservation model developed in the Kruger National Park and spread to other parts of South Africa, has successfully resulted in the highly popular medicinal plant the pepper bark tree being downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable. The conservation intervention that supplies traditional healers with cultivated plants to grow in home gardens, has reduced pressure on wild populations while ensuring continued access to culturally important resources. The intervention has slowed and reversed the species’ decline, leading to a genuine improvement in its Red List status. Building on this success, the model is now being expanded to other medicinal plant species, offering a replicable blueprint for balancing cultural practices with biodiversity conservation.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional healers are receiving seedlings of the Warburgia salutaris to support conservation and sustainable use of this culturally important medicinal species.

The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern, and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of plants is calculated using a sample of 900 plant taxa.\nThe Red List Index results indicate a gradual decline in the conservation status of plant species. About 5% of the sample taxa became more threatened between 1990 and 2018, with a further 2% increasing in threat between 2018 and 2024.\nAn increase in extinction risk is evident for plant taxa occurring in the Desert and Succulent Karoo biomes (Figure 3). Rising threat levels for plants have largely been driven by climate change and habitat loss caused by mining and renewable energy developments. Most of the plants that have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape. The province has been severely affected by drought over the past decade and continues to face pressure from mining and renewable energy developments.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for plant taxa assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Map showing the distribution of plant taxa that have increased in threat status since the NBA 2018, based on the representative sample of 900 plant species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nSpecies in terrestrial ecosystems are subject to multiple and interacting pressures, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive alien species, pollution, resource use, and climate change. Among these, habitat loss remains the most significant pressure and the single largest cause of species decline. The main drivers of habitat loss include the conversion of natural vegetation for croplands, mining, plantations, human settlements, and infrastructure development. Habitat fragmentation further affects ecological functioning and the viability of species, especially under climate change and biological invasions.\nRecent analyses reveal a notable shift in the primary drivers of extinction risk for plant taxa. Historically, these risks were predominantly associated with competition from invasive species, agricultural expansion, urban development, and overgrazing by livestock. However, current trends indicate an increasing influence of climate change and habitat degradation linked to mining activities, alongside emerging threats from renewable energy infrastructure development. This shift is particularly evident in the Northern Cape Province, where a significant number of species have been uplisted due to increasing extinction risk. The province has experienced prolonged drought over the past decade and continues to face expanding mining activities. In addition to climate change, emerging threats such as renewable energy development could further impact already stressed ecosystems.\nAgriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock farming, continues to affect the largest proportion of taxa (68%), while residential and commercial developments, though largely historical, still impact 36%, with a small but ongoing decline. Among the species that changed in threat status, the main contributing pressures were competition from invasive alien species (57%), harvesting of plants (28%), and habitat loss due to mining (13%). The influence of climate change and severe weather events is also becoming more pronounced, now affecting 11% of taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s plant taxa, based on a representative sample of 900 plant taxa. This bar chart shows the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened plant species. Pressures are categorized using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and are ranked from most to least frequent number of impacted species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Illegal trade in succulent plants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s unique succulent diversity, particularly in the globally significant Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot, faces catastrophic pressure from a dramatic surge in illegal harvesting driven by lucrative international demand. Since 2017, 878 species, the majority endemic, have been impacted by indiscriminate wild collection. A total of 878 species have been illegally collected, with 12 species considered functionally extinct due to the majority of their populations being harvested from the wild.\nThe succulent trade crisis stems from multiple interconnected factors: a notable absence of cultivated material to meet global horticultural demand, limited economic opportunities in remote regions like the Northern Cape that make residents vulnerable to recruitment by criminal syndicates, inadequate in-situ protection measures across vast arid landscapes, and the proliferation of online trade platforms that facilitate laundering operations. These pressures have been exacerbated by climate change impacts, including extended drought conditions since 2016, the COVID-19 pandemic’s socio-economic effects, and overwhelmed conservation authorities struggling with insufficient resources and capacity to manage the growing volume of confiscated plants requiring specialized care.\nRecognizing that initial law enforcement-focused responses had limited impact, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and the Environment, in partnership with the South African National Biodiversity Institute and WWF South Africa, developed the comprehensive National Response Strategy and Action Plan in 2022 to address the illegal trade holistically through collaborative multi-stakeholder action. The strategy encompasses seven interconnected objectives designed to ensure both conservation outcomes and sustainable socio-economic development: ensuring long-term survival of representative wild populations, establishing well-managed ex-situ collections for confiscated specimens, capacitating compliance and enforcement sectors with improved resources and coordination, streamlining regulatory frameworks to support enforcement while enabling sustainable use, reducing pressure on wild populations through community engagement and livelihood diversification, developing effective communication strategies about the trade’s impacts, and exploring options for a formal legal economy that benefits conservation and local development. Each objective identifies specific actions, lead agencies, supporting partners, priorities, and timelines, with SANBI coordinating overall implementation through dedicated coordination positions established in 2023.\n\n \nThe trends in the illegal plant trade are constantly changing. Dwarf succulents from the family Aizoaceae originally dominated it, while geophytes and Euphorbia have become more popular recently.

    "text": "Protection level\nPlants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 taxa. Peripheral taxa with less than 5% of their distribution in South Africa were excluded from the analysis. Protection levels were calculated for this sample to track changes in extinction risk over time (see the technical approach here).\nThe analysis indicates an overall increase in the number of Well Protected species, while species in the Poorly Protected and Moderately Protected categories showed only minor changes. Of the 900 species assessed, 72 (8%) shifted protection level categories between 2017 and 2024. Most of these changes (60) were positive, driven primarily by improved management and the establishment of new protected areas. However, deterioration in management effectiveness at eight protected areas led to a decrease in the Protection Level for 12 species. Plant species are severely affected by threats occurring within protected area boundaries, leading to a downgrade in their protection category. The main reason for the ineffectiveness of these protected areas is the high level of plant poaching in the protected area of Namaqualand.\nMany species have shown an improvement in their protection levels since the last assessment in 2018. A total of 5% of the assessed plant species now have better protection, largely due to the proclamation of the Mountain Zebra–Camdeboo Protected Environment, Gamsberg Nature Reserve, and Orange River Mouth Nature Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

    "text": "Species recovery\nAs part of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4, signatories are committed to taking urgent action to halt human-induced extinctions, reduce species’ risk of extinction, and improve their conservation status by 2030. Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts to prevent and reverse species declines, recover and conserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity, particularly among threatened species. South Africa has initiated a process with each taxonomic group that has comprehensive Red List assessments for their taxonomic groups, to identify and prioritise species in urgent need of recovery to contribute to achieving the GBF Target 4 goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. A prioritization process for plant recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 3000 plants threatened with extinction, multiple interventions to address threatened species declines are required, including the expansion of protected areas, the restoration of habitats that are being degraded by invasive species, and the inclusion of threatened plants in biodiversity sector plans. In addition, 293 critically endangered and endangered plants need active recovery projects to take place in order to ensure that they do not go extinct in the next decade. Between 2020 and 2023, the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) led a process to prioritise plants in urgent need of recovery, using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria to select those in most urgent need of recovery. A species recovery working group with conservation agencies and indigenous plant growers has been established, and each stakeholder has been allocated a handful of species to implement recovery work on. A major upscaling of resources to support species recovery is required, as only 14 of the 293 species that require recovery have active recovery projects implemented.\nBelow are two examples of critically endangered plant species that require urgent recovery interventions to ensure their long-term survival. The accompanying flyers outline the key activities needed, including habitat restoration, population reinforcement, and threat mitigation.

    "text": "Key findings\n\nIn the current assessment, 728 taxa have been evaluated, and 26 of these species are endemic to South Africa, Eswatini, and Lesotho.\nNearly 13% (93) of assessed birds are threatened with extinction, with another 7% (54) assessed as Near Threatened.\nThirty-four percent (9 out of 26) of South Africa’s endemic birds are threatened with extinction, placing full responsibility for their protection on the Republic of South Africa.\nBirds are becoming increasingly threatened with extinction, with 39 species uplisted to higher threat categories. While eight species were downlisted, showing some improvement in status.\nThe main pressures driving change in threat status have remained similar to those driving change in the previous assessments, but in this assessment, the plight of waterbirds has been highlighted, with many water birds being uplisted to a higher category of threat.\nFreshwater health needs improvement to protect these species; however, it will require strong political commitment and resources. Many freshwater species are congregatory and thus vulnerable to disease outbreaks, making greater protection of key sites essential to slow declines. At the same time, urban freshwater systems offer valuable opportunities for citizen-led restoration and monitoring.\nUsing a subpopulation method based on proximal protected areas, a large proportion of birds are Well protected within the South African Protected Area Network (86% - 561 species); with only 7% Poorly Protected and in need of intervention to increase their protection level.\nWhen protection level is assessed using a Minimum Conservation Population (MCP) approach that incorporates species-specific abundance thresholds, protection levels are far lower: only 10% of Red Listed species are Well Protected, while the vast majority (90%) remain inadequately protected despite occurring within the protected area network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Threat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nSouth Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini host a rich assemblage of bird species, many of which are endemic and have drawn global conservation interest. The region has a long history of publishing lists of threatened bird species, with Red Data Books published in 1976, 1984, 2000, and most recently in 2015, when 132 species were listed with an IUCN threat category greater than Least Concern. Given growing evidence of shifting population trends and continued anthropogenic pressures reshaping habitats, an updated Regional Red List assessment was conducted by BirdLife South Africa from late 2021 to early 2025, with contributions from 138 species experts (see approach section below for further details on how the assessment was conducted).\nA total of 25 species were uplisted from LC or Not Evaluated to higher threat categories due to deterioration in status. Most of these (n = 16) were waterbirds, followed by terrestrial (n = 6), seabirds (n = 2) and a raptor species (n = 1).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Threat status of 728 South African bird taxa assessed following the IUCN 3.1 Red List Categories and Criteria. The portion of species in each category is shown in the larger circle(A), and the proportion of endemic species per category is shown in the smaller circle (B). The total number of taxa assessed is shown in the inner circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Summary statistics for percentage threatened and endemic birds, and number of species within each threat category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxon\nCritically Endangered\nEndangered\nVulnerable\nNear Threatened\nLeast Concern\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nOverall birds\n11\n33\n49\n54\n580\n727\n\n\nEndemic birds\n2\n3\n4\n8\n9\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConservation success story: the White-winged Flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White-winged Flufftail is one of Africa’s rarest and most threatened waterbirds, with breeding confirmed only in South Africa and Ethiopia. Previously listed as Critically Endangered (CR), the species was downlisted to Endangered (EN) in South Africa in 2025. This change reflects not a reduction in threats, but a better scientific understanding of its distribution and population size, accompanied by significant conservation success in safeguarding its specialised wetland habitat.\nSince 2020, BirdLife South Africa’s Wetland and White-winged Flufftail Conservation Project has spearheaded efforts to conserve high-elevation wetlands, the species’ breeding habitat during the wet season. The project vision is to maintain and improve the quality and quantity of these wetlands to support threatened species and secure ecosystem services for local communities. The approach integrates management, restoration, protection, stewardship, advocacy, awareness, and research using the White-winged Flufftail as a flagship species for wetland conservation.\nKey achievements include:\n\nManagement & restoration: Publication of Best Practice Guidelines for High-Elevation Wetland and Peatland Management in Southern Africa in multiple local languages, bridging the gap between scientific research and land users responsible for stewarding wetlands.\nProtection & stewardship: Declaration of Middelpunt Nature Reserve (527 ha) and designation as a Ramsar Site, expansion of the Greater Lakenvlei Protected Environment (21,400 ha), and new stewardship agreements in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal to conserve biodiversity alongside daily land-use activities.\nCommunity engagement: Establishment of the Steenkampsberg Birding Routes and employment of a community bird guide at Ntsikeni Nature Reserve to promote eco-tourism and local custodianship through financial incentives.\nPolicy & advocacy: Publication of surveying and mitigation guidelines for environmental impact assessments of developments within the bird’s distributional range, endorsed by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment.\nAwareness: Publication of two children’s books (and audiobooks) for different age groups and raising awareness among children and adults during the annual Flufftail Festival hosted on World Wetlands Day.\nResearch: Dedicated surveys using passive monitoring equipment provided the first empirical population estimate of ~900 breeding pairs (1,800 mature individuals) across just 20 km² of suitable habitat in South Africa.\n\nThese collective efforts, underpinned by partnerships with government, landowners, NGOs, universities, and international agreements (e.g., AEWA and CMS), directly informed the 2025 IUCN Regional Red List assessment for the White winged Flufftail. The protection level for the species has changed from “Not Protected” to “Poorly Protected” thanks to the declaration of key protected areas. The White-winged Flufftail now qualifies as Endangered under criterion B2ab(iii), highlighting both its precarious status and the tangible conservation gains achieved through science-based collaborative action.\nBy using the White-winged Flufftail as a flagship species for wetland conservation, conservationists have not only improved prospects for one of Africa’s most elusive birds, but also safeguarded critical wetlands that sustain biodiversity and provide water resources for many downstream communities.\n\n \n\n\nWhite-winged flufftail, landing (left), while monitoring is taking place in its habitat (right). © Kyle J. Lloyd\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs)1. The RLIs are calculated based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of birds was calculated for all taxa that have been reassessed (n = 729).\nThrough calculating the RLI, it was found that many species have shifted in their threat levels over the last decade. Results indicate that the average RLI score across 729 species decreased between 2015 and 2025, evidence that the overall extinction risk has worsened. 147 species had a threat status higher than Least Concern for 2025.\nAlthough 131 species showed no change in status, 39 deteriorated (moving into higher risk categories) and 8 improved. The analysis highlights that habitat degradation, invasive species, powerline collisions, climate change, and fisheries impacts remain pressing conservation issues. Targeting these threats is essential, especially for species newly classified as Vulnerable or Endangered.\n\nFigureTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for bird taxa assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time.

The distribution of 33 non-seabird bird species that have increased in threat status since NBA 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nThis assessment suggests agriculture and aquaculture are the dominant threat to South African birds, representing 63% of cumulative pressure—nearly double the impact of natural system modifications at 43%. The agriculture category encompasses three critical sub-pressures: wood and pulp plantations contributing 24%, annual and perennial non-timber crops at 23%, and livestock farming at 16%. These findings reflect South Africa’s extensive agricultural transformation, particularly in grassland and fynbos biomes. Grassland species such as Botha’s and Rudd’s Larks (Heteromirafra ruddi), Blue Swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea), African Grass Owl (Tyto capensis) and Denham’s Bustard (Neotis denhami) are under extreme pressure with declining populations, while plantations similarly affect forest species such as Cape Parrot (Figure 5).\nBotha’s Lark and Lappet-faced Vulture (Torgos tracheliotos) were uplisted to Critically Endangered (CR). Their key threats, habitat loss and poisoning respectively, are well understood, and urgent conservation action is essential to prevent their extinction\nNatural system modifications, the second-largest threat, primarily involve ecosystem alterations and fire suppression regimes that disrupt natural habitat dynamics.\nWaterbirds are particularly vulnerable to natural system modification, in addition to pollution of wetlands and waterways, with Mangrove Kingfisher (Halcyon senegaloides) being a notable example of a species undergoing declines (Figure 5). The decline of waterbirds not previously considered threatened is particularly concerning, though unsurprising given the poor state of freshwater habitats. These habitats are highly vulnerable to pollution, invasive species, siltation, and extreme weather. Improving freshwater health will require significant political will and resources. Freshwater species also face added risks because many are congregatory, making them prone to disease outbreaks. Greater protection of key sites is needed to prevent accelerated declines, while urban freshwater systems present opportunities for citizen-led restoration and monitoring.\nClimate change emerges as the third major pressure at 30%, driven predominantly by habitat shifting and alteration as species distributions respond to changing climatic conditions.\nNotably, biological resource use—primarily hunting and collecting terrestrial animals—accounts for 24% of pressure, while human development pressures including residential and transportation infrastructure collectively represent 28% of threats. The data aggregation reveals that while individual sub-pressures may appear manageable, their cumulative impact within broader pressure categories creates substantial conservation challenges requiring integrated landscape-scale management approaches. Scavenging birds such as vultures and Tawny Eagle (Aquila rapax) are experiencing rapid declines due to poisoning and persecution (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s mammals, based on the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme (IUCN, 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHabitat loss in the grasslands: Botha’s Lark (Spizocorys fringillaris)\n\n\n\n\n\nBotha’s Lark is one of South Africa’s most threatened birds, now assessed as Critically Endangered, with only 340 individuals estimated to be left (Colyn, 2025). Endemic to the high-altitude grasslands of Mpumalanga and the Free State, its tiny global population has declined by more than 80% over the past decade. The primary driver of this decline is habitat loss and degradation, with over 90% of its preferred short-grassland habitat converted to croplands (maize and soya), or altered by inappropriate grazing practices.\nRecent field surveys, modelling of preferred habitat extent, and SABAP2 data trends confirm alarming range contractions, including the near disappearance of the species from its former northern and southern distribution limits. The few remaining strongholds, such as the Wakkerstroom–Daggakraal region, are under increasing pressure from maize farming, pasture improvement, and invasive alien plants. Habitat fragmentation further isolates subpopulations, limiting dispersal and increasing extinction risk.\nBotha’s Lark exemplifies the broader crisis facing South Africa’s sourveld and highland grasslands, ecosystems that provide critical ecosystem services such as water regulation and carbon storage but remain among the most poorly protected biomes. A range of other threatened species call these areas home, including Rudd’s Lark and Yellow-breasted Pipit.\n\n\n\n\nBotha’s lark (Spizocorys fringillaris).

Conservation responses have included stewardship agreements with private landowners, community outreach, and exploration of targeted habitat restoration. However, without urgent expansion of formal protection and sustainable land-use practices, this iconic species faces imminent extinction.\nSee assessment for full assessment details - https://www.birdlife.org.za/red-list/bothas-lark/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePoisoning crisis: Africa’s vultures on the brink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican white backed vulture (Gyps africanus). Mass poisoning event of African white backed vultures in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal. © Chris Kelly\n\n\n\nPoisoning is the single greatest driver of vulture declines across Africa. In southern Africa and beyond, almost all scavenging vulture species are now listed as Critically Endangered: White-headed (Trigonoceps occipitalis), Hooded (Necrosyrtes monachus), White-backed (Gyps africanus), Bearded (Gypaetus barbatus), and Lappet-faced (Torgos tracheliotos) Vultures. Only the Cape Vulture (Gyps coprotheres), which breeds in colonies and has benefited from decades of conservation action, and the Palm-nut Vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), with its specialised diet of raffia palm fruit and aquatic prey, are not considered Critically Endangered.\nAmong the most devastating practices is sentinel poisoning, where poachers deliberately lace carcasses with toxic substances to eliminate vultures that might otherwise reveal illegal activities by circling above a kill. These events can wipe out hundreds of individuals in a single incident, erasing decades of conservation progress in a matter of hours.\nVultures are also highly vulnerable to secondary poisoning. In many rural areas, carcasses are baited with pesticides or poisons to target carnivores such as jackals, caracals, and lions. When vultures descend to feed, they are killed unintentionally in large numbers. Because these birds forage communally, even one poisoned carcass can have catastrophic consequences.\nOther sources of poisoning continue to exacerbate the crisis. Veterinary drugs (e.g. Diclofenic) used to treat livestock can remain in carcasses and are toxic to scavengers. Lead poisoning from ammunition fragments in carcasses has been detected in several vulture populations. Even contaminated water sources pose risks in areas where agricultural chemicals are poorly regulated. Collectively, these threats undermine not only vulture populations but also the ecological role they fulfil.\nThe decline of vultures has far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and people. As nature’s clean-up crew, vultures rapidly dispose of carcasses, helping to prevent the spread of diseases such as anthrax and rabies. Their disappearance risks creating a dangerous vacuum in which carcasses linger, promoting outbreaks that threaten wildlife, livestock, and human health alike.\nRecognising the urgency of this crisis, governments and conservation organisations have developed targeted responses. The International Vulture Multi-species Action Planbotha2017a? and the South African Multi-species Biodiversity Management Plan for Vultures2 both identify poisoning as the top conservation priority. Actions include phasing out the most dangerous agrochemicals, raising awareness among farming and hunting communities, tracking individual vultures, and deploying rapid-response poison intervention units. One striking example of the latter occurred in May 2025 in Kruger National Park, when the Endangered Wildlife Trust and SANParks mounted a large-scale rescue after an elephant carcass was poisoned, managing to save more than 80 vultures through rapid detection, treatment, and rehabilitation. Such coordinated responses are vital, yet prevention remains the ultimate goal. Without urgent and sustained action to combat poisoning at its source, Africa risks losing much of its vulture guild within a generation.\nDespite these efforts, numbers of Lappet-faced and other vultures continue to decline. They are wide-ranging and require engagement and action across many countries. If poisoning is not urgently and decisively addressed, southern Africa risks losing much of its vulture guild within a single human generation, with profound ecological and social consequences.",

    "text": "Protection level\nTo measure protection status, BirdLife South Africa applied two complementary approaches: a subpopulation-based method covering 667 terrestrial bird species, and a population-based method applied to 130 Red List species with available abundance estimates. (see approach below). The subpopulation approach confirms that most birds are spatially well represented within the protected area network, with over 84% classified as “Well Protected” in both 2017 (84.1%) and 2025 (84.9%), in broad agreement with the Retief and Marnewick (2017) study. Between 2017 and 2025, mean Protection Level scores increased from 7.50 (±0.32 SE) to 8.53 (±0.35 SE), representing a 13.7% increase, although only nine species (1.3%) showed improved protection categories between assessment periods – most gains were for species of low conservation concern.\nThe population-based analysis paints a more sobering picture, revealing that only 10% of threatened species meet minimum viable population thresholds inside protected areas. However, there was a positive movement to improved category status from 2017 to 2025: 123 of the 130 red list species did not reach the ‘well protected’ category in 2017, compared to 117 for 2025, representing an improvement of 4.6%. Together, these results highlight both the conservation value of South Africa’s protected areas and the gaps that remain, particularly for threatened, range-restricted and habitat-dependent species that require targeted expansion and improved management of the network (Lee and Ehlers Smith 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Protection level for birds was assessed for 667 taxa.

The overall protection level of bird species varies dramatically depending on the assessment method used as well as sets of species used. The analysis is based on actual populations for 130 of 193 species which were comprehensively assessed during the 2025 Red Listing process. ‘Subpopulations’ represents populations in connected protected area clusters, not subpopulations as per the IUCN definition for Red Listing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.

    "section": "Species recovery",
    "text": "Species recovery\nDespite South Africa’s extensive protected area network, many bird species remain at high risk of extinction because they face pressures that persist even when habitat is nominally safeguarded. Large birds, including vultures and storks, are prime examples. Recovery interventions are therefore critical to prevent imminent extinctions and to reverse long-term declines. Birds requiring recovery action tend to fall into three groups: (1) highly range-restricted endemics whose tiny populations are declining faster than habitat loss alone can explain; (2) species exposed to direct anthropogenic pressures such as poisoning, fisheries interactions, or collisions with energy infrastructure; and (3) island or seabird populations threatened by invasive predators at breeding sites.\nPriority areas for bird recovery are guided by the 2025 Red List assessments and subsequent expert consultations. These processes identified species whose continued declines are unlikely to be halted by protected area coverage alone, and which therefore require targeted interventions. While the expansion of protected and conserved areas under Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 3 is essential, recovery planning shows that protection alone is insufficient unless paired with targeted species-focused measures. Where published prioritization exists, such as the Biodiversity Management Plan for Vulturesd2024a? or the Mouse-Free Marion Project plans, these form the basis for coordinated action. In other cases, BirdLife South Africa and partners use a combination of Red List urgency, ecological feasibility, and opportunity for partnerships with landowners or government to determine priorities.\nSelected active recovery projects are highlighted below (Table 4). This showcases both the diversity of interventions needed and the scale of resources required. Some species, such as Botha’s Lark, require stewardship agreements and changes in land-use practices to secure remnant grassland habitat. Others, such as the Blue Swallow, demand artificial nest-site provisioning and alien clearing in addition to site protection. For marine birds such as the African Penguin, population recovery hinges on fisheries reform, fishery closures around key colonies, and advocacy on threats such as ship-to-ship bunkering.\nSeveral threatened vultures (White-backed, Lappet-faced, Hooded and White-headed Vultures) require landscape-scale threat reduction, including poison-response networks, regulation of traditional medicine markets, a change in the hunting culture for a preference for lead-based ammunition, and mitigation of electrocution and collision risks. In contrast, the Bearded Vulture recovery strategy combines in situ action with a long-term ex situ programme (“Bearded Vulture Captive Breeding Project”), where harvested eggs are raised in captivity and juveniles reintroduced. Species like the Black Harrier highlight the urgent need for collision mitigation at wind energy facilities, given population viability models showing extreme sensitivity to adult mortality.\nOn Marion Island, a suite of seabird species (including albatrosses, petrels, and prions) are threatened by invasive House Mice, which predate on chicks and even adults. Without eradication, local extinctions are predicted within a century. The Mouse-Free Marion Project, budgeted at over R560 million, represents the largest single bird recovery initiative underway in southern Africa. See marine bird page for further details.\nCollectively, these examples illustrate that recovery work is expensive and long-term, with estimated costs for the next five years exceeding R695 million and current funding falling short by hundreds of millions. While interventions are in place for many species, most require upscaling if they are to prevent extinctions. Success will depend on strong partnerships among government, NGOs, researchers, landowners, and local communities, and on mobilising significant new resources to match the scale of the challenge, in alignment with global commitments such as GBF Target 3 (expansion and effective management of protected areas) and GBF Target 4 (halting species extinctions and promoting recovery).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Once widespread across southern Africa, the species has disappeared from large parts of its former range, and today is largely confined to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and parts of Mozambique.\nIn response, the species has become the focus of intensive conservation action. South African based NGO VulPro, established in 2007, has played a central role in rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured birds, returning over 600 vultures to the wild and pioneering one of the only dedicated captive-breeding programmes for African vultures. Their facilities in Hartbeespoort and the Eastern Cape also provide a base for research on movement ecology, toxicology, and disease, alongside extensive education and community outreach.\nComplementary initiatives by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) address systemic threats at both national and continental scales. Through its Vultures for Africa Programme, the EWT has trained more than 6,500 people in 17 African countries to respond to and manage poisoning incidents, produced a multilingual Wildlife Poisoning Response Protocol, and supported the adoption of at least nine national response plans in poisoning hotspots. The organisation also spearheaded International Vulture Awareness Day, now celebrated annually in over 40 countries, as well as long-term tracking and monitoring programmes that have established tagged populations in Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana and Uganda. At home, EWT leads South Africa’s Wildlife and Energy Programme, marking thousands of kilometres of powerlines in partnership with Eskom, and sits on the National Vulture Task Force and the Lead Task Team addressing poisoning and lead exposure.\nAt the international level, multiple conservation organisations have played a pivotal role in developing and reviewing the Multi-species Action Plan for African–Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP) under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). Its 2023–24 mid-term review highlighted the escalating risks of belief-based use, bushmeat-related poisoning, and the collision threats posed by expanding renewable energy infrastructure. These findings underline the urgency of both national and transboundary collaboration to secure vulture populations. But as a result of these efforts, Cape Vulture was downlisted from Endangered (2015) to Vulnerable (2025).\nDespite these successes, ongoing recovery remains essential. Cape Vultures face intensifying threats, particularly from collisions with rapidly expanding wind energy facilities where mitigation measures are not applied, and from increasing demand in the traditional medicine market. Sustained investment in rescue, rehabilitation, population supplementation, and systemic threat reduction (alongside continued political commitment, regional cooperation, and community involvement) will be vital to secure the long-term survival of this species.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nWhile many longstanding pressures on South Africa’s birds are well recognised, a number of emerging threats and uncertainties require urgent research attention.\nAgriculture and expansion of croplands continues to be linked to biodiversity loss, but the dynamics of this have been poorly quantified. For example, the rapid expansion of shaded agriculture, where fruit orchards are increasingly sealed under giant greenhouse structures will likely have negative impacts on avian biodiversity. These prevent access to flowering trees by natural pollinators and may have cascading impacts on terrestrial biodiversity. Parallel to this, agrochemical use has grown substantially, yet its full impact on South African birds and other wildlife is poorly understood. In addition, the spread of novel crops, including genetically modified organisms introduced into new habitats, raises questions about long-term ecosystem impacts.\nClimate change represents a cross-cutting pressure whose biodiversity impacts remain poorly quantified at the species level. Although broad projections suggest range contractions and distribution shifts for many taxa, very few South African birds have been assessed using bespoke best-practice models that integrate climatic, habitat and demographic data. This leaves major uncertainty about which species are most vulnerable, the likely magnitude of impacts, and where conservation interventions should be prioritised. Incorporating climate velocity, dispersal capacity, and habitat quality into future assessments will be critical to identify both high-risk species and potential refugia.\nEnergy demand is another fast-moving frontier. The growth of cryptocurrency mining and AI technologies is driving global electricity consumption, yet the scale and consequences for South Africa remain largely unquantified. At the same time, renewable energy developments, particularly the rapid rollout of wind energy projects in Mpumalanga and along the coast, pose escalating risks for birds and bats. Offshore wind is also emerging as a potential future pressure on marine biodiversity.\nNew biological challenges are also evident. The proliferation of novel diseases, often exacerbated by climate change and land-use shifts, poses unknown risks to terrestrial bird populations. Bush encroachment in the karoo, grasslands and savannas, inappropriate fire regimes, and habitat fragmentation continue to alter habitat quality for specialist species. Illegal ploughing and clearing of natural habitats remain a widespread challenge, often circumventing environmental impact assessments.\nMarine and coastal systems face their own suite of emerging pressures. Sardine stocks remain depleted, yet sardines are a keystone prey resource for seabirds and other predators; current operational management procedures inadequately account for ecosystem needs. Coastal aquaculture, including reliance on fishmeal and bonemeal inputs, has ecological knock-on effects that are poorly quantified. Sand mining is expanding along the east coast, threatening coastal biodiversity. Meanwhile, ship-to-ship bunkering operations, paused off Algoa Bay but likely to increase elsewhere, introduce additional risks of oil spills, noise pollution, and chronic disturbance in sensitive seabird areas.\nAddressing these gaps will require both targeted research and systematic integration of new pressures into future Red List and protection level assessments. Improved data on novel threats, particularly energy infrastructure, agrochemical exposure, and marine resource exploitation, will strengthen conservation planning and ensure that the National Biodiversity Assessment reflects the full scope of pressures shaping South Africa’s birdlife.",

    "text": "Approach\nThreat status\nThe Regional Conservation Assessment for the birds of South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini was conducted by BirdLife South Africa with contributions from 138 species experts. It was initiated in late 2021, and assessments concluded at the start of 2025. This assessment builds upon the 2015 Eskom Red Data Book findings. All of Southern Africa’s non-vagrant species were assessed for signs of decline using citizen science datasets such as SABAP2, CWAC and CAR3. Taxon experts conducted assessments, updating assessments conducted in 2015 and conducting new ones for newly identified species (See Regional Red List of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini here - https://www.birdlife.org.za/red-data-book/ ).\nSpecies deemed vagrants or introduced to the assessment region were excluded. At least 5% of a species’ global population or distribution needed to fall within the region to qualify for an assessment. We used as a starting point BirdLife South Africa’s Checklist of South Africa’s birds for 2023. This lists 876 species, but 123 were vagrant and 10 introduced. Introduced and vagrant species are not assessed during the Red Listing process, leaving 753 species. The taxonomy followed is that of the IOC World Bird Listgill2024a?. During 2023, a focus was on assessing Seabird species, for which there are few public datasets available, and where assessments rely heavily on expert knowledge. In 2023, a comprehensive synthesis of citizen science datasets for terrestrial (including freshwater) bird species was undertaken and these datasets fed the 2024 assessments of terrestrial and freshwater birds3 4. The thresholds and methods follow IUCN Global and Regional Red List guidelines and take into account new data on distribution, population trends, and known threats (IUCN Red Listing process summary here).\nProtection level\nProtected areas are the backbone of biodiversity conservation in South Africa. To measure protection status, BirdLife South Africa first piloted a species-level Protection Level (PL) metric in 2017, measuring the number of viable bird subpopulations occurring in well-managed protected areas (Retief and Marnewick 2017). Species occurring in &gt;20 protected areas were deemed to be well protected. The method was refined for the current National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) using improved spatial data, updated land-cover information, and a cluster-based definition of subpopulations, with &gt;10 subpopulations required in protected area clusters. This framework allows a systematic comparison between 2017 and 2025, providing an evidence-based measure of how effectively the protected area network supports the long-term persistence of South Africa’s avifauna4.\n\nData source\n4barnes2000a?\n\n\nRecommended citation\nLee, A., Smith, D.E., Raimondo, D.C., Van Der Colff, D., Hendricks, S.E., & Lloyd, K. 2025.

    "text": "Key findings\n\nIn the current assessment, 135 taxa have been evaluated, and 82 (61%) of these species are endemic or near-endemic to South Africa, Eswatini, and Lesotho.\nTwenty-two percent of assessed amphibians (30 species) are threatened with extinction, with another 10% (13) assessed as Near Threatened.\nThirty-nine percent of South Africa’s endemic amphibians are threatened with extinction, placing full responsibility for their protection on South Africa.\nAmphibians are becoming increasingly threatened with extinction, even though only three species have experienced a genuine increase in threat status; many species are still experiencing ongoing pressures.\nThe main pressures causing population declines are invasive and other problematic species, impacting 83% of threatened species. Impacts range from infectious diseases to drying out and replacement of habitat by invasive alien plants. This is followed by habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural activities (72%) and natural system modification (69%) related to, for example, wetland drainage, overgrazing, and inappropriate fire cycles. Recognized as the most important emerging threat globally, climate change impacts are also becoming an important driver of amphibian declines in South Africa affecting nearly half of threatened species, although the impacts of this threat are challenging to quantify.\nA large proportion of amphibians are assessed as Well protected (73%) within the South African Protected Area Network; however, 11% (15) of amphibians are Not Protected. Of the 29 threatened species, 79% are considered under-protected (Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected or Not Protected). Meaning that our most threatened species require improved protection, and most protected areas do not consider amphibians in their management activities.\nAlmost 50% (17) of South Africa’s threatened species occur in the Western Cape province. Given the high endemicity within this province, and the disproportional number of endemic species that are threatened, this spatial pattern is not surprising. The Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces support six threatened species respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Most threatened species occur in and are endemic to the Western Cape (24 species), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (10 species) and then the Eastern Cape (5 species).\nTwenty-two percent (30 species) of amphibians were assessed as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable), and a further 10% (13 species) were assessed as Near Threatened. There have been significant shifts in the number of species per category since the 2016 assessments, with 23% of species experiencing a category change, although most of these have been non-genuine either because of improved application of the red list criteria or because of extensive survey efforts resulting in better knowledge of the status of populations. These changes include a decrease from 6 to 4 Critically Endangered species; an increase from 9 to 18 Endangered species; an increase from 1 to 8 Vulnerable; and a reduction of 4 to 2 Data Deficient. All 135 species were able to be assessed, with no Not Evaluated species remaining.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Three of four previously DD species were assessed (one as EN and two as NT). This provides evidence that DD species are often more threatened than ‘data-sufficient’ species as proposed by Borgelt et al. 2022 and demonstrates the value of prioritizing DD species for funding and dedicated surveys. An example of this is the Moonlight Mountain Toadlet, Capensibufo selenophos. The Endangered Wildlife Trust secured funding to carry out extensive surveys between 2020 and 2023, and drive habitat protection processes with landowners. Seven previously unknown subpopulations of C. selenophos were confirmed across the\n\n\n © Keir Lynch\nAkkedisberg, Kleinrivier and Soetmuisberg Mountains in the Western Cape. Knowledge on threats was improved, and one property (approximately 700 ha) has been put forward for formal declaration through Biodiversity Stewardship and is being actively managed for control of alien invasive plants. This new information resulted in a non-genuine change from DD to EN based on an EOO of 478 km2, deterioration of habitat quality, and suspected declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoston Rain Frog (Breviceps batrachophiliorum)\nAn example of a newly described species being assessed is the hot-off-the-press Boston Rain Frog, Breviceps batrachophiliorum (du Preez et al. 2025), which was previously assessed as B. bagginsi. Based on morphological, call and genetic analyses, the new species has been redescribed and split, resulting in an assessment of Endangered for B. batrachophiliorum and Critically Endangered for B. bagginsi. This grassland-associated species is restricted to the\n\n\n © Louis Du Preez\nmidlands area in south central KwaZulu-Natal province. Records are confirmed from the Boston (type locality), Richmond, the Karkloof and Bulwer areas. Currently, the species is understood to occur at three subpopulations across less than 3000 km2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Mountain Ghost (Heleophryne rosei)\nThe Table Mountain Ghost Frog (Heleophryne rosei) provides an interesting example of how new information, and correct application of the IUCN Criteria and Categories, can impact the perceived extinction risk of a species. Heleophryne rosei has been listed as Critically Endangered for over 20 years, during which the same four threats have been implicated in reducing stream quality and extent. Despite this, there were no detailed studies undertaken to link specific threats to aspects of the species’ ecology to understand presumed declines and inform conservation actions. As such, the species remained listed as Critically Endangered because of on-going declines in habitat quality, small EOO, and one threat defined location. This began to change in 2019 when a multi-stakeholder project was launched to obtain fine-scale data on the species, increasing our understanding of magnitude and source of threats. While this habitat\n\n\n © Joshua Weeber\nspecialist is still extremely range-restricted and experiencing continued habitat loss, the project revealed that the location and source of known threats are diverse and the species is therefore considered to occur at 2-4 threat locations (different streams on Table Mountain). Data from this project are now being used to inform management frameworks for headwater mountain streams, emphasizing the importance of fine-scale studies in amphibian conservation in South Africa, and supporting the view that priority research needs to inform conservation of amphibians1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs)2. The RLIs are calculated based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern, and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of amphibians was calculated for all amphibian taxa that have been reassessed (n = 135).\nThirty-two species have had a change in status during the latest assessment (2016 to 2025). Only three species have had a genuine change in status (Breviceps macrops – desert rain frog (NT to VU), Amietia hymenopus - Phofung river frog (NT to VU) and Hyperolius poweri Power’s reed frog (LC to NT). These three species are spatially isolated; however, they share some pressures, as both Breviceps macrops and Amietia hymenopus are likely to be impacted by climate change, where the former is restricted to the dry West Coast and relies on limited precipitation in the form of fog, and the latter occurs in streams along the Drakensberg Escarpment and Lesotho, which may face increased drying and extreme weather events. Both species are also impacted by the expansion of mining activities, B. macros specifically on the West Coast, due to the future planned development of the Green Hydrogen and A. hymenopus in the highlands of Lesotho into South Africa (Table 3). Hyperolius poweri has experienced a reduction in its range size due to the continued impacts of existing pressures and the intensification of urban coastal development, mining, afforestation, and agriculture (especially sugar cane plantations), which have caused wetland drainage and degradation through trampling from cattle.\nThe remaining thirty species that have had a change in their status were considered to be non-genuine changes due to new information, taxonomic changes, application of criteria, etc. There has been no improvement in status for amphibians during the assessment period. This is important to note: amphibians remain threatened by pressures that haven’t ceased and are increasing in most instances. Of particular concern are the impacts of invasive alien species, which affect 83% of threatened species, particularly in cases where the spread of invasive species is continuing or increasing. Impacts of this threat include drying out and replacement of habitat by alien invasive plants, diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and competition with problematic native species (Box 2).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for amphibian taxa assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Over 85% of the species’ known range occurs outside of protected areas and it occurs in a region of heavy development pressure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The distribution of three amphibian species that have experienced a genuine increase in threat status since the NBA 2018, including from the West Coast of South Africa, Breviceps macrops (NT → VU), on the Drakensberg Escarpment between South Africa and Lesotho, Amietia hymenopus (NT → VU), and the KwaZulu-Natal east coast Hyperolius poweri (LC → NT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nGlobally, habitat loss is the most common threat to amphibians, impacting 93% of threatened species, with agricultural expansion being the leading cause of habitat loss and degradation3. For South Africa’s frogs, the main pressures driving declines are impacts from invasive species, affecting 83% of threatened species threatened. These impacts include replacement of natural habitat due to expansion of woody invasive plants, drying out of wetlands and streams, changes to stream dynamics, including sedimentation, and alteration of natural fire regimes, and alteration of natural fire regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2: Invasive species impacts on range-restricted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critically Endangered Rough Moss Frog, Arthroleptella rugosa is restricted to the Klein Swartberg Mountain in the Western Cape. Within less than a decade, large portions of its fynbos and seep habitat was invaded by Cluster Pines, Pinus pinaster. A study using bioacoustics to estimate frog densities found that numbers at invaded sites were directly affected by P. pinaster infestations4. At invaded sites, call densities (and hence population numbers) were\n\n\n\n\n© Alouis and Keir Lynch Bionerds\n\n\n\n\nreduced, while at uninvaded sites call denisties were notable higher. This relationship held over time, with reduced call density recorded at sites with increasing invasion of alien Cluster Pines, and conversely an increase in call density at sites that became less invaded. These results confirm previous suggestions that invasive pine trees cause population declines in A. rugosa.\n\n\n\n\nThese findings were used as motivation for conservation action and a joint initiative through CapeNature, the Endangered Wildlife Trust, Fynbos Trust, 18 landowners and the Klein Swartberg Conservancy, resulted in adaptive fire management to control pine invasion across the range. An ecological burn was carried out, which covered approximately 4000 hectares, and eradicated pines from areas where A. rugosa occurs. Post-fire monitoring has confirmed increasing numbers of frogs, and a 10-year management plan has been developed with the Conservancy, including ongoing alien plant management. This is a great example of conservation\n\n\n\n\nPine infestation of fynbos habitat on Klein Swartberg where the Critically Endangered Rough Moss Frog, Arthroleptella rugosa, occurs. © Rob Erasmus, Enviro Wildfire.\n\n\n\n\nneeds being guided by expert knowledge and Red List assessment information, which have also resulted in the designation of this species entire range as an Alliance for Zero Extinction site, thus gaining international attention, strengthening partnerships and work with landowners towards formal habitat protection for this species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore and after images showing a reduction in pine invasion from July 2021 (left) to April 2022 (right) at the type locality of A. rugosa through the use of a controlled ecological burn. © Alouis and Keir Lynch Bionerds\n\n\n\n\nThis is followed by habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural activities (impacting 72% of threatened species) and natural system modification related to, for example, inappropriate fire cycles, impacting 69% of South Africa’s 30 threatened species. Globally, climate change is now recognised as the most serious emerging challenge facing amphibians, with 29% of threatened species worldwide impacted. With projected increases in temperature and changes in precipitation, this threat is expected to affect more species in the future. In South Africa, almost half (48%) of our threatened species are impacted, or projected to be impacted by climate change and extreme weather, including through shifts in habitat, droughts and flooding. These impacts require improved data, both in terms of species monitoring and climate data such as regional projections to feed into modelling exercises. This will help us understand how changes to climatic variables may impact amphibians in South Africa. Thirteen threatened species (43%) are affected by pollution, particularly from agricultural effluents and domestic and urban wastewater, with for example subpopulations of the Kloof Frog, Natalobatrachus bonebergi, in the Durban area being impacted by sewage overflows into streams and increased sedimentation from urban construction severely impacting stream health and breeding sites. So, even while this species has been downlisted to NT due to overall EOO, the KwaZulu-Natal subpopulations face increasing levels of threat. These impacts reflect that state of South Africa’s freshwater ecosystems, with 85% of freshwater species experiencing declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s amphibians, based on the percentage of impacted threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme (IUCN, 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3: The impact of habitat loss and degradation on South Africa’s amphibians\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmathole Toad (Vandijkophrynus amatolicus)\nAll 30 of South Africa’s threatened (CR, EN, VU) frog species are affected in one way or another by habitat loss and degradation (driven by agriculture, natural systems modifications, residential and commercial development, energy production and mining, and linear infrastructure for transportation and service corridors). As with global trends, agriculture is the main driver, impacting 77% of threatened species3, while in South Africa agriculture impacts on 93% of threatened frog species. This includes impacts from livestock farming, including overgrazing, non-native tree plantations, non-timber crops, and erosion and siltation. System modifications include changes to fire frequency and intensity, water abstraction, and dam construction.\n\n\n © Alouis and Keir Lynch Bionerds\nThe Endangered Amathole Toad, Vandijkophrynus amatolicus, occurs in an area of the Eastern Cape highlands where original grassland habitat has been heavily transformed by both agriculture and timber production. However, working with livestock farmers to improve grazing management through regenerative agriculture approaches and facilitating habitat protection processes through Biodiversity Stewardship may prove beneficial to this toad, while supporting livelihoods within this strategic water source area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Western Leopard Toad (Scelophrys pantherina)\nHabitat loss due to residential and commercial development impacts many of the country’s amphibians, perhaps none more so than the Western Leopard Toad (Scelophrys pantherina). Typically associated with low lying wetlands and vleis in the Western Cape province, the species has lost over 75% of suitable habitat predominantly due to urban infrastructure expansion, leading to several local extinctions and severe population declines throughout its range. Urban infrastructure in the form of roads also causes\n\n\n © Luke Verburght\nsignificant individual mortalities of breeding adults every year when toads move from their summer foraging grounds through now developed areas towards suitable breeding habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings (including roadkill) of this species by the public can be uploaded to iNaturalist, with sightings in the Overberg specifically to: iNaturalist.\nContributions of occurrence records of any species are extremely valuable and have made up a significant proportion of data used in the current assessments (See Box 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4.

Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa); (A) shows the protection level for all taxa; (B) shows the protection level for South African endemics.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the 2025 PL was higher than in 2016. While close to 72% of amphibians are considered well protected, 22% are poorly or not protected. Species-specific management within protected areas is generally lacking for amphibians, with7% (9 species) less well protected once we took PA management effectiveness into account. For the 75 endemic amphibians assessed, 57% are Well Protected, 17% (13 species) are Not Protected, and a further 17% (13 species) are Poorly Protected. Sixteen highly threatened (CR and EN) species are under-protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.

Examples of threatened species that have benefitted from improved protection include the Endangered Micro Frog (Microbatrachella capensis), Pickersgill’s Reed Frog (Hyperolius pickersgilli), and the Cape Platanna (Xenopus gilli). In the case of H. pickersgilli, an additional 16 sites have been confirmed for the species since 2017, with several of these occurring within protected areas5. Habitat protection gains have been a key outcome of the coordination of the Biodiversity Management Plan for this species, with several sites (totaling 127 hectares) being declared through the Biodiversity Stewardship Programme, as well as improved management and wetland health for these, and existing protected areas5. For M. capensis, the confirmation of the species in the Nuwejaars Wetlands Special Management Area in 2021, which is now being managed with the frog as a management target, has resulted in both an expansion of the species’ range with Protected Areas, as well as improved management effectiveness scores from fair to good. It is important to recognize the contribution to the protected area estate that Biodiversity Stewardship and conservation servitudes (or OECMs) through agreements with landowners for targeting unprotected populations of species makes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.

    "text": "Species recovery\nAs part of the Red List process for southern Africa, the Amphibian Ark (AArk) joined the expert workshop and worked with the coordinators to produce a Conservation Needs Assessment (CNA) for threatened South African amphibian species6. This used a process developed by AArk to determine which species have the most urgent conservation needs, based on action plans that combine in situ and ex situ actions, as appropriate. Six South African species were identified as needing ex situ conservation actions, including ex situ rescue (n = 5) and ex situ research (n = 1). Due to their level of threat, the five species recommended for ex situ rescue are also recommended for biobanking. Twenty-five species were recommended for in situ conservation, and 34 species are recommended for in situ research, while 15 species were identified for conservation education programs.\nIn addition, subsequent work to identify species requiring urgent recovery under Target 4 of the Global Biodiversity Framework resulted in 10 species being prioritised. This includes threatened endemic species and those of regional importance that might go extinct even if their habitat is protected. This speaks to the level of targeted management within protected areas that has not traditionally been focused on for amphibians and the need for research into responses to management interventions.\nSouth Africa has a relatively proactive community working on amphibian conservation and research, with NGOs, provincial authorities and various universities contributing to building conservation evidence for assessing the effectiveness of conservation interventions and growing the body of knowledge on amphibian taxonomy, behavior and ecology (Table 3). This in part was guided by the conservation and research strategy compiled following the 2010 Red List assessments7, demonstrating the value of these processes, with plans in place to update this strategy following the most recent assessments. While good strides have been made, amphibian conservation capacity remains overlooked and underfunded compared to other taxa8, and this is particularly pertinent in the African context.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Pickersgill’s reed frog: Conservation action at work\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example of coordinated conservation action for Pickersgill’s Reed Frog, Hyperolius pickersgilli, provides a good case study of a relatively long-term recovery project in which new knowledge has not only resulted in a threat status reduction (from Critically Endangered in 2010 to Endangered in 2016), but also in concerted efforts to understand and mitigate threats. Stemming from recommendations in the 2011 Strategy for Conservation Research7, a Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) was co-developed between key stakeholders and has resulted in many achievements over the past decade, including improvements in knowledge of distribution, genetics and habitat requirements, implementation of monitoring protocols, a captive breeding program, improved habitat protection gains (including a biodiversity offset) and improved habitat management. Research related to the project was published in four peer-reviewed articles and has contributed to seven post-graduate studies. Of the 16 actions identified for the first iteration of the BMP, 17% had been completed, 65% were on track, 6% had minor issues, and a further 12% were still in the planning phase by 2022. Overall, 24 participating organizations have been involved, and implementation of actions resulted in direct employment of over 150 people across institutions as well as stimulating an influx of funding to support actions5. In 2008 the species was known from less than 10 sites; today it is known to occur at almost 40 localities, and multiple breeding wetlands within these localities. The BMP helped strengthen government support as well as improved integration of research outputs into spatial planning and environmental compliance. Interest in the project also generated vast exposure, including television, signage and social media campaigns, reaching thousands of people. While this species’ range continues to be within an area of rapid transformation, this project that has resulted in the species improving its protection level from Poorly Protected in 2018 to Moderately Protected in 2025 demonstrates the successes that can be achieved through collaboration and the commitment of partners from a range of influences.\n\nRelease site for captive-bred Pickersgill’s Reed Frog in 2018 when 400 captive-bred individuals were released back into the wild through collaboration between Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Joburg Zoo and the Endangered Wildlife Trust.\n\n\n\nPartnering for Pickersgill’s Reed Frog’ - a sign put up at various H. pickersgilli sites explaining the Biodiversity Management Plan.",

    "section": "Knowledge gaps",
    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nWhile amphibians globally remain the most threatened (41%) vertebrates on Earth, basic data on species distribution, population numbers, and ecology remain poor. This is likely partly a result of limited funding, with amphibians receiving the least conservation funding of all major groups globally. Less than 2.8% of funding support is directed to amphibians globally, and this has declined from 4% in the 1990s8. Projects on amphibians are also often focussed on multiple species, limiting investment per species. This differs from projects focussed on other taxa that often receive disproportional support, in some cases even for species that are not threatened (e.g., large mammals). This lack of funding is likely the root cause of several knowledge gaps discussed below and is also linked to inadequate capacity in amphibian research and conservation. These gaps are even more acute outside of South Africa in other parts of the continent.\nSimilarly, despite major efforts in recent decades to improve knowledge on amphibian declines, there remains a disconnect between research and translation of this into conservation actions. Research priorities identified at the global scale include better understanding of the effects of climate change, community-level drivers of declines, methodological improvements for research and monitoring, genomics, and effects of land-use change. Improved inclusion of under-represented members of the amphibian conservation community was also highlighted1. In South Africa, growing amphibian conservation and research capacity in a way that is representative is critical to addressing capacity gaps and providing skills transfer to young researchers to grow core conservation expertise.\nKnowledge gaps related specifically to Red List processes for amphibians include that for most assessments, Criterion B (Geographic range information) is primarily used to inform assessments. Research projects that generate population data, both over time and in response to threats and management interventions will be useful to strengthen amphibian Red List assessments, and in turn to provide baseline data for adaptive conservation strategies. Using the outputs from Red Listing, including recommended conservation and research actions, is critical for prioritizing and guiding future conservation strategies, and such strategies have been found to be effective in improving taxonomy, ecological studies, monitoring, research outputs, and capacity building9.",

    "text": "Approach\nRed List Assessment\nAll previously assessed South African amphibians were reassessed as part of the Southern African Amphibian Red List Project (SAARLP) that commenced in 2023, as part the third global amphibian assessment process, supported by the IUCN Amphibian Specialist Group and Amphibian Red List Authority. 135 species were assessed for publication on the IUCN Red List in 2025 and 2026, including 11 newly described species since 201610. Over 150,000 records were collated for the assessments, including from various institutions and verified citizen science data. Twenty experts representing thirteen organizations contributed to the assessment process.\nProtection Level Assessment\nThe species protection level assessment measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards a species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a “persistence target” for each species — the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends not only on the area protected but also on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected — ≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected — 50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected — 5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected — &lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assessment was applied to 133 amphibian species with the persistence target set at the area required to protect 10 000 individuals.\nThere are two components included in the protection level assessment:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas — quantifies how much of the area of suitable habitat required to support the persistence target of 10 000 individuals falls within existing protected areas.\nProtected area effectiveness — adjusts for how well pressures that cause species declines such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes etc are mitigated within protected areas.\n\nThe degree to which protected areas effectively mitigate threats are scored as:\n\nGood, when the protected area is fully effective in protecting the species against major threats;\nFair if the protected area provides some mitigation of major threats to species but is not completely effective;\nPoor if the protected area provides no mitigation of the major threats to the species.\n\nEffectiveness ratings were provided by provincial and national conservation agencies responsible for protected area management as well as taxon experts.\nThe above analysis was first undertaken for NBA 2018 and was repeated in 2025 using updated species occurrence data based on the 2025 Amphibian Red List Reassessment. A spatial layer of protected areas for 2018 and 2025 representing protected areas that were declared at that time were used for the two time periods. A technical report outlining the full methodology and limitations will be available in February 2026.",

    "text": "Threat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nA total of 506 marine species have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria and are included in the NBA, drawing from a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Of these, approximately 36% of taxa are threatened in 2025, while 18% of 376 assessed species were threatened in 2018. This difference is due to the inclusion of additional species (including all sharks, rays and chimaeras, additional corals and selected marine invertebrates), many of which are threatened. However, the high proportion of threatened taxa is not fully representative of the extinction risks at the realm level because there has been a focus on assessing economically important species and groups known to be at risk (such as corals, sharks, rays and chimaeras, rock lobsters and abalone), with few comprehensively assessed marine taxonomic groups leading to an inflation of threat results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Summary of number of marine species within each IUCN Red List category. The total number of taxa that have been assessed is shown in (A) and number of South African endemics within each category are shown in (B).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency, with many taxonomic groups not evaluated for their risk of extinction, and ~8% of assessed species being Data Deficient. Capacity shortfalls, gaps in taxonomic knowledge, and the lack of information on species distribution, life histories and long-term population trends have led to limited assessments and high levels of data deficiency. These shortfalls signal the need to address knowledge gaps and increase capacity for foundational research on marine species (including taxonomy and strengthened distribution data) and comprehensive IUCN Red List assessments for entire taxonomic groups.\nA comprehensive assessment of cartilaginous fishes (i.e. sharks, rays and chimaeras), was included in NBA 2025 drawing from global and national assessments, with this group emerging as one of the most threatened groups across all realms (41% threatened) Figure 1 A. Many cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, with slow growth and low reproductive output, and are thus inherently vulnerable to fishing. Many cartilaginous species are also wide-ranging and much of their declines can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other regions. However, 42% of South Africa’s endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened Figure 1 B, indicating that the country has the main role in reversing declines of these species. Endemic species at highest risk of extinction include the Happy Eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsi) and Twineye Skate (Raja miraletus), both being assessed as Endangered. Globally and in South Africa, the main threats to sharks are unsustainable fishing as target and bycatch species, and habitat degradation1 2. In South Africa, cartilaginous fishes are caught as target and bycatch species in industrial fisheries, targeted catch in recreational fisheries, and targeted in lethal bather protection shark nets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The scalloped hammerhead is Critically Endangered. © Thomac Kotuc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends (RLI)\n\nThe RLI for top predators such as sharks shows deteriorating threat status over time (Figure 3). Sharks perform a range of essential ecological functions – as apex and meso-predators in many marine food webs, they often control the populations of their prey, maintaining diversity at lower trophic levels (including commercially fished species) and functional coastal and marine ecosystems (NPOA-II). Loss of top predators therefore has potential knock-on effects on the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities and food security.\nThe decline in sharks is a global trend3. Globally, the main threats to sharks are fisheries (as both target catch and bycatch), habitat degradation resulting from coastal development, and probably climate change. As most of South Africa’s 191 shark species have ranges that extend well beyond South African waters, some of the decline in the RLI for South Africa’s sharks reflects fishing pressure and other threats beyond South Africa’s jurisdiction. When national adjustments in threat status are taken into account, the South African RLI is marginally higher and the declining trend is marginally less steep than the global RLI for the same set of species. Nevertheless, 6 of South Africa’s 13 endemic sharks are threatened with global extinction, with their future fully dependent on conservation and fisheries management actions in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for marine species assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct).\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 10 (24%) of South Africa’s 42 seabreams (sparids) are at risk of extinction with 2 Critically Endangered, 4 Endangered and 4 Vulnerable species (Figure 1 A). The dageraad Chrysoblephus cristiceps and red steenbras (Petrus rupestris) are Critically Endangered4 with Endangered taxa including seventy-four Polysteganus undulosus5, red stumpnose Chrysoblephus gibbiceps, West Coast and white steenbras Lithognathus aureti and L. lithognathus.\nSeabream trends remain relatively stable with some species uplisted and others downlisted (Figure 2). Since the previous assessments in 2009, three seabreams have improved in terms of threat status including the seventy-four Polysteganus undulosus (from CR to EN), red roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (from NT to LC) and carpenter Argyrozona argyrozona (from NT to LC). Effective fisheries management measures and marine protected areas (MPAs) have supported recovery of some of these linefish. Two taxa became more threatened, the red steenbras Petrus rupestrus (EN to CR) and the West Coast steenbras Lithognathus auretti (NT to EN). Recreational fisheries are a particular concern for these two species.\nSouth African kob species (Argyrosomus genus)—including dusky, silver, squaretail, and west-coast dusky kob—are highly valued food fish targeted by recreational, commercial and small-scale fishers, and are also caught as trawl bycatch. Once abundant, the populations of dusky (Argyrosomus japonicus), silver (Argyrosomus inodorus) and squaretail kob (Argyrosomus thorpei) have collapsed, largely due to a long history of overexploitation and habitat degradation.  Dusky kob has been assessed as Critically Endangered, whilst squaretail and silver kob have been assessed as Endangered and Vulnerable respectively6.\nThese sciaenids are inherently vulnerable: they are large, relatively slow growing and late maturing, spawn in predictable aggregations, and their juveniles show varying degrees of dependence on estuaries and associated critical ecosystem functions (such as food provision and refuge from predators). Their susceptibility to overfishing is worsened by habitat degradation from sedimentation, freshwater flow reduction, pollution, and agricultural runoff. Similar appearances among species complicate identification by fishers in the field, challenging effective species-specific management. Current regulations are inadequate, particularly for the large recreational sector, while climate change and the declining quality and quantity of estuarine habitats pose additional threats (Box 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. South Africa co-developed a conservation strategy to improve the threat and stock status of kobs6.\n\n\n\n\n\n A collaborative conservation strategy involving government and non-government stakeholders established five key objectives: (1) reform current regulations with public engagement; (2) foster stewardship among users and managers; (3) enhance spatial protection of spawning sites, nurseries, and bycatch hotspots; (4) ensure adequate freshwater flow to estuaries; and (5) address critical research gaps. Each objective includes specific actions, responsible parties, priorities, and timelines.\nThe strategy invites researchers, fishers, conservationists, and decision-makers to contribute toward the long-term vision of recovering kob populations to sustainable levels in South Africa.\n\n\n\nOf South Africa’s 6 marine reptiles, four of six species are threatened (Figure 1 A) with 3 of 5 turtles at risk from fisheries bycatch or incidental mortalities. Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are regionally Critically Endangered and are a conservation priority. South Africa’s only sea snake is Least Concern.\nSeabirds are the most threatened group of birds in South Africa and globally. Approximately 39% are threatened (Figure 1 A) with albatrosses being the most threatened group of seabirds with incidental mortality linked to industrial trawl and longline fisheries posing the major threat (see Subantartic). All seven seabird species endemic to the southern Benguela are threatened, with worsening trends for three species over the last decade. Endemic seabird species include three species that specialise on small pelagic fish (primarily anchovy and sardine), the African penguin (now globally CR), Cape cormorant (EN) and Cape gannet (VU)7. The threat status of these seabirds is driven by competition with the purse-seine fishery8 and climate change. Crowned cormorant (now VU but NT in 2015) and Hartlaub’s gull (VU but LC in 2015) were uplisted due to a combination of threats including human disturbance at breeding colonies, predation and diseases. Bank cormorants (EN) are threatened by the decline of their major prey species, west coast rock lobster (Box 4) and breeding failure associated with climate change and other human disturbance.\nEight of 50 (16%) marine mammals are threatened (Figure 1 A) with the Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea being a key species of concern in South African waters9. A major threat is lethal shark control measures (Box 4), with pollution, coastal development and shipping also contributing to pressure on this species. Marine mammals show a positive trend (Figure 2) due to the improvement in status of a subantarctic species, southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) downlisted from Near Threatened to Least Concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. The most threatened marine mammal in South Africa, the Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin is at risk of extinction due to threats such as pollution, lethal shark control measures, shipping and coastal development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are likely less than 500 individuals of Endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphins in South Africa . © Brett Atkins\n\n\n\nRecently re-assessed, nationally and globally, the status of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea remains Endangered and the situation is dire, but not without hope. A major threat to humpback dolphins - incidental bycatch in the lethal shark control programme in KwaZulu-Natal has been reduced following changes in fishing gear. However, levels of chemical pollutants in humpback dolphins, including persistent organic pollutants, also known as “forever chemicals”, and heavy metals, continue to be the highest of any marine mammal in South Africa and amongst the highest globally. Shipping and coastal development are other major threats and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors, which are difﬁcult to pinpoint and mitigate, are impacting this small population which is currently estimated to be fewer than 500 individuals. The recent expansion of South Africa’s MPA coverage (e.g., uThukela Marine Protected Area) may have a positive effect on this species, but pressures on this species need to better managed both inside and outside protected areas. The development of a National Biodiversity Management Plan remains a top priority to ensure the long‐term survival of the species in South Africa. International collaboration is being strengthened with the recent formation of the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin Conservation Network (HuDoNET), linking scientists and conservationists across the species’ range.\n\n\n\nDue to poor taxonomic knowledge and a paucity of occurrence records, most marine invertebrates cannot be assessed – however, shallow water reef-building corals were assessed globally and a sample of beach macrofauna and key invertebrate resources were assessed nationally. Globally, corals are now the second-most threatened species group after cycads (link https://www.iucnredlist.org/). Of the 128 South African shallow reef-building corals assessed globally, 34% are threatened (Figure 1) by climate change (link to KMA1). Many of these are from the Acroporidae family. There are three Endangered Montipora coral species in South Africa. They are sensitive to thermal stress and are often the first taxa to show signs of bleaching, thus providing an early warning of climate stress in South Africa’s coral reef ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. South Africa experienced the worst coral bleaching observed to date in 2025, although this is still far less than more severe mass bleaching events recorded in other parts of the world. Coral bleaching is the loss of symbiotic algae, triggered by elevated sea temperatures and other environmental stressors, leaving corals white and compromised, often leading to mortality. © Kerry Sink\n\n\n\n\n\nCorals show the steepest trend in worsening threat status (Figure 3), noting that these are global assessments with no national assessments conducted to date. South Africa’s shallow water reef building corals, stony corals, have experienced less coral bleaching and are likely less threatened than elsewhere in the region and globally10 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. Abalone remains in crisis and was assessed as Endangered by the IUCN in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndemic abalone (Haliotis midae) is Endangered. © Steve Benjamin\n\n\n\nHaliotis midae, commonly known as perlemoen, was listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 202112 due to the collapse of what was once a thriving commercial fishery that peaked at 2,800 tons in 1965 but has been severely reduced. Current legal quotas of only 96 tons is now allowed annually. The legal commercial fishery, managed through Total Allowable Catch allocations across seven zones in the Western Cape, has been systematically undermined and overwhelmed by industrial-scale illegal fishing operations. Organized criminal gangs, linked to international drug trafficking, have exploited this species at catastrophic levels, with illegal harvests estimated at over 2,000 tons annually compared to the tiny legal quotas. Population surveys reveal widespread recruitment failure throughout all commercial zones, as illegal fishing targets predominantly immature individuals below the legal minimum size, preventing reproduction and causing population densities to fall below levels necessary for successful breeding. The IUCN assessment projects continued steep decline in spawning biomass through 2035, with recovery possible only through a 59% reduction in poaching combined with robust enforcement measures.\n\n\n\nAssessments from a small sample of utilized marine invertebrates in South Africa (10 spiny lobsters, abalone and the white mussel) found that 4 of 12 resources species are threatened. South African abalone Haliotis midae (Box 3), white mussel Donax serra and West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii (Box 4) are all Endangered, signaling the need to support recovery of these species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. West coast rock lobster, Jasus lalandii is nationally assessed as Endangered with its status driven largely by illegal fishing and exacerbated by environmental changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Coast rock lobster was assessed as Endangered in 2025. © Geoff Spiby\n\n\n\nJasus lalandii, the West Coast rock lobster, was globally assessed as Least Concern in 200913 as part of international efforts to assess crustaceans. However, a national assessment in 2025 found this species to be Endangered, primarily due to severe population decline, with exploitable biomass falling by 68% over the past three generations (45 years) and current stock levels at only 1.2% of pre-fished levels from 1910. The species faces overwhelming pressure from illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is estimated to remove more than twice as much biomass annually as legal fishing operations. Total Allowable Catch quotas were reduced by 91% from over 5,000 tons in the late 1970s to just 505 tons in 2024/2025, reflecting the resource’s dire condition. A small positive trend in the recent stock assessment has led to an increased quota allocation for 2025/26 fishing season, however, overall, the resource remains at significantly reduced levels and requires ongoing cautious management. Environmental stresses have compounded fishing pressures, including significant reductions in somatic growth rates since the 1990s, mass strandings caused by low oxygen events (with an estimated 2,000 tons lost in the 1997 “walkout” alone), and an eastward distribution shift that has disrupted traditional fishing areas. Climate change effects, including increased frequency of algal blooms and hypoxic conditions, continue to threaten the species through habitat degradation and physiological stress. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is slow-growing with a 15-year generation length and complex life cycle including an extended larval stage. Despite decades of management measures including minimum size limits, seasonal restrictions, and operational management procedures, the combination of heavy illegal fishing pressure and environmental changes has pushed this economically important species into crisis14\n\n\n\nThe endemic South coast rock lobster Palinurus gilchristi (Box 5) was assessed as Vulnerable in 2025 due to current overfishing, with historical illegal fishing also a key contributing factor. Abalone and South Coast rock lobster are endemic and their assessments are global, but the West Coast rock lobster assessment is a national assessment. Other rock lobster assessments are global and all are considered to be Least Concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. A national assessment of South Coast rock lobster, Palinurus gilchristi revealed that it is Vulnerable due to overexploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Coast rock lobster. © Unknown\n\n\n\nPalinurus gilchristi, the South Coast rock lobster, was nationally assessed as Vulnerable using the IUCN Red List criteria in 2025 primarily due to historical overexploitation that caused significant population declines over the past three generations (48 years). The species’ exploitable biomass has declined by 35% since the 1977/1978 fishing season, with current stock assessments indicating spawning biomass is at only 41% of pre-fished levels. A major contributing factor was illegal overharvesting by one company between 1987-2001, which significantly exceeded fishing quotas and caused concurrent decreases in both biomass and catch rates. The species’ biological characteristics make it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, as it is long-lived (up to 30 years), slow-growing, and doesn’t reach sexual maturity until around 10 years of age. While improved management measures including reduced quotas and fishing effort controls have led to some recovery in recent years, the cumulative decline over three generations still qualifies the species for Vulnerable status under IUCN Red List criteria A 2d\n\n\n\nA total of 20 South African sandy beach macrofauna were recently assessedharris2025a? and are the first beach invertebrates to be added to the IUCN Red List globally. Of these, 4 (20%) are listed as Endangered and a further 3 (15%) are Near Threatened. Key species of concern include the pillbugs Tylos granulatus (EN) and Tylos capensis (EN), the beach ground beetle Acanthoscelis ruficornis (EN) and the white mussel Donax serra (EN) ((Box 6), Link to coast species). The pressures on beach macrofauna include mining on the West Coast, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, overfishing, and removal of washed-up kelp from the shore (See Pressures page).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 6. White mussel, Donax serra is now Endangered primarily due to overharvesting\n\n\n\n\n\nDonax serra, the white mussel, is listed as Endangered primarily due to severe population declines of 50-80% over the past decade, as evidenced by commercial fishery data showing catch-per-unit-effort more than halving and approximately 80% reduction in total catch in South Africa. The species faces multiple compounding threats, with commercial and recreational harvesting being the primary driver, particularly after management changes in 2007 that switched from total allowable catch limits to effort-based regulations, leading to reported harvests increasing from around 50,000 individuals annually in the 1990s-2000s to over 1-1.45 million per year after 2007/2008. Mining activities, which affect about 20-25% of the species’ range, cause significant habitat degradation by changing beach sand grain size through tailings deposits, making the sediment too coarse for the clams to burrow effectively and essentially eliminating them from affected sites. Resurveyed beaches show dramatic declines, with abundance at four sites near Plettenberg Bay dropping to only 24-48% of 1980s levels. Anecdotal reports from both Namibia and South Africa describe former abundance hotspots where the species is now extremely difficult to find. The species is particularly vulnerable because it is restricted to specific fine-sand beach habitats and has limited dispersal ability despite having pelagic larvae, making recovery from local population crashes difficult when combined with the ongoing multiple stressors across its range.\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nKey pressures on marine species include fishing (industrial, recreational, illegal fisheries and lethal shark control measure), climate change and pollution (see Pressures in the Marine Realm). Coastal mining, freshwater flow reduction and estuarine degradation are also of concern6 harris2025a?. Managing these pressures through increased investment in fisheries management, effective integrated coastal management, diversifying bather protection measures, promoting responsible environmental practices and spatial conservation measures will help to secure South Africa’s species for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Key pressures on South Africa’s threatened marine species. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme. The size of the bubbles indicates the percentage of taxa impacted by each pressure class.\n\n\n\n\n\nA meta-analysis of the key pressures impacting on taxa of conservation concern revealed that fishing remains the greatest pressure on marine species (Figure 5). Key additional pressures include pollution (plastics, underwater noise, waste water and effluent) and freshwater flow reduction, while key threats include climate change and marine alien and invasive species.",

    "text": "Species stock status\nStock assessments are conducted for fisheries species and constitute a rigorous approach to assessing species resource status. Stock status is distinct from IUCN Red List status which uses the IUCN approach to assess extinction risk, although stock status and fisheries catch trends are often a key informant in IUCN Red List assessments.\nImprovements in stock assessment methods, particularly for data-sparse species, have enabled more species to be assessed since the last NBA. A total of 65 stocks were reported as assessed in 2025. Of the assessed resources, nearly a third are depleted or heavily depleted (32%) and 43% are abundant or optimally exploited (Figure 6). The stock status of a quarter of South Africa’s assessed marine resources (25%) remains unknown due to insufficient knowledge and data (Figure 6)15.\nEffective science-based management has supported stock recovery of the carpenter seabream (Argyrozona argyrozona) in the last two decades. Important resources such as silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) remain depleted, despite signs of improvement from its previous heavily depleted state; whilst dusky kob (A. japonicus), dageraad (Chrysoblephus cristiceps), red steenbras (Petrus rupestris) and seventy-four (Polysteganus undulosus) remain heavily depleted and are yet to show significant signs of stock recovery (link to sparid page). Recovery of many linefish species has been hampered by their life history characteristics, including slow growth, late maturity, hermaphroditism and residency, which make them vulnerable to exploitation. Whilst the linefish emergency declared in 2000 has supported some stock recovery through a reduction in exploitation16, many linefish remain unassessed or depleted and are sought after particularly in the open-access recreational fishery and the newly recognised small-scale fishery. Recent recommendations focus on more holistic ecosystem-based management for the linefishery (Potts et al. 2020) that recognizes the complexities of the multiple sectors, species, and interacting socio-economics. Harmonised policy and fisheries governance (across commercial, recreational and small-scale sectors) can enable more equitable sharing of limited linefish resources and can stand the linefishery in good stead to not only see species recovery but also maximize economic and social benefits and outcomespotts2020a?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Stock status of South Africa’s marine living resources (adapted from DFFE 2025)15\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge pelagic resources such as southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are depleted. While very few sharks and rays have fisheries stock assessments, many of those assessed still have too little data to assign a stock status and have been listed as unknown. Where data are sufficient, several are in a poor state, with soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus) being heavily depleted, and shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus), dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), happy eddie (Haploblepharus edwardsii), yellowspotted skate (Leucoraja wallacei) and twineye skate (Raja miraletus) assessed as depleted. As apex predators, sharks and rays play an important role in marine food webs. Currently, sharks and rays are targeted in the demersal shark longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal bather-protection shark nets, and caught as bycatch in several fisheries including the large pelagic longline fishery. Urgent effort is needed to halt the rapid decline in shark and ray resources. Management strategies such as the published National Plan of Action for Sharks II17 and the draft National Shark Biodiversity Plan18 make recommendations for improved fisheries and biodiversity elements of cartilaginous fish management. Implementing these recommendations, particularly through a coordinated approach that provides for integrated shark and ray conservation is needed to secure South Africa’s globally significant shark, ray and chimaera biodiversity (link to shark and ray page).\nTraditional fishing resources such as snoek (Thyrsites atun), and commercially important resources such as shallow-water hake (Merluccius capensis) remain abundant with deep-water hake (Merluccius paradoxus) being optimally exploited.\nInvertebrates such as white mussel (Donax serra) and octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were assessed as unknown, despite the use of these resources gaining popularity and white mussel being assessed as Endangered by the IUCN (Box 6). Abalone (Haliotis midae) and West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) remain heavily depleted due to illegal resource use.\nTo ensure fair and sustainable fisheries that support ocean life and human livelihoods, effective fisheries management plans should be implemented for all sectors, to manage the impacts on ecosystems, species, genes and people (link to Key message and marine priority action)",

    "text": "Approach\nFor the marine realm of the NBA 2025, we report on species assessed using the IUCN Red List in terms of extinction risk and the state of resource species for which stock status is assessed.\nSouth Africa’s IUCN Red List assessment work is co-ordinated by SANBI’s Threatened Species Programme but is conducted by groups of species specialists. A total of 506 South African marine species have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria through a combination of national, regional and global assessments. Assessments of sharks, rays and chimaeras, sparids, and corals were undertaken by the IUCN species specialist groups, with many species assessed using global assessments. However, 33 species of cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) were assessed nationally, meaning that the IUCN criteria were applied to the portions of the populations that occur in South Africa’s water. Adjustments were undertaken for species where we had sufficient data to show that extinction risk trends were different from global trends.\nThe NBA 2025 assessment includes IUCN Red List assessments for kobs conducted as part of South Africa’s kob conservation strategy6, the first assessments for beach invertebrate fauna, work to assess selected marine invertebrate resources and compilation of global coral assessments for shallow water coral species reported in South Africa. Seabirds were regionally assessed by Bird Life South Africa (BLSA), mammals were assessed regionally by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) and reptiles were assessed using a combination of global and regional assessments.\nThe trend in species IUCN Red List status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI). The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. In 2025, sharks, rays and chimaeras, sparids, and corals were included in the RLI for the first time.\nInformation about resource stock status is drawn from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment’s State of Fishery Resources reports15 to provide an overview of species stock status for fished taxa and examine main trends in marine resources over the assessment period.",

    "text": "South Africa’s unique terrestrial biodiversity is globally recognised, with high species diversity and exceptional levels of endemism (especially for plants). The wide climatic range and varied geology and topography result in an equally diverse set of 463 terrestrial ecosystem types. This natural heritage supports vibrant rural and urban land uses and provides essential ecosystem services. The steady loss of terrestrial habitat and decline in species populations due to various human activities, set against a backdrop of accelerating climate change, paints an overall picture of decline in the biodiversity and ecosystem services on which we rely. Gains in protection of species and ecosystems (through biodiversity stewardship programs) and growing sustainable use and restoration efforts are a positive trend. Biodiversity inclusive spatial planning, a well-established practice in South Africa, is a key tool in striking the balance between development and biodiversity.\n\n\n\nAgriculture in the Hemel-en-Aarde Valley, Western Cape (©Andrew Skowno)\n\n\n\n\n\n30%\nof 463 ecosystem types\nThreatened\n26%\nof 463 ecosystem types\nWell Protected\n\n\n\n14%\nof 24 678 taxa assessed\nThreatened\n77%\nof 2345 taxa assessed\nWell Protected\n\n\n\n\nThirty percent of South Africa’s terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as threatened, this translates to 11% of the remaining natural habitat. There has been an overall increase in the risk of collapse of terrestrial ecosystems since 2014. While a quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types are Well Protected, the same percentage are Not Protected. The overall trend for protection is positive, with a steady increase in the Protected Areas network - primarily due to biodiversity stewardship programs. The full results can be found on the Terrestrial ecosystem threat status page and Terrestrial ecosystem protection level page.\nA total of 24 678 terrestrial taxa have been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria. Of these, 14% are threatened, while in 2018, 13% of 22 667 assessed taxa were threatened. The only new taxonomic group included is the Spiders (2214 taxa) that have very low levels of threat (4%), so the overall increase in the proportion of species threatened is an indication of many species in other taxonomic groups becoming more threatened. Species Protection Levels are increasing, but greater gains could be made through more effective management of protected areas. An overview of species threat status and protection level in the terrestrial realm can be found on the Terrestrial species page. Detailed findings per taxonomic group can be found on the Species findings pages\nThe state of biodiversity is shaped by both current and historical pressures. Croplands cover a very large portion of the terrestrial realm (&gt;16%), but there has been limited expansion into natural areas in recent times. In contrast, the expansion of settlements and mining are relevant both historically and currently. Certain activities, such as targeted poaching of succulent plant species and renewable energy installations represent new pressures on biodiversity. Climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity are increasingly prominent, with studies more clearly attributing species declines and landscape changes to temperature and rainfall regime change. A summary of the main pressures in the terrestrial realm can be found on the Terrestrial pressures page.\nPriority actions across all realms are summarised on the Priority actions page, and discussed in Key messages A2, A4, A6, B1, B3, B4, B5.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe terrestrial species assessments in the NBA are supported by dozens of experts from institutions across South African and abroad, they are acknowledged in the species findings pages.\nThe terrestrial ecosystem threat status and protection level analyses for the NBA 2025 used input data from a wide range of sources.

    "text": "Ecosystem threat status results\nEcosystem threat status is a headline indicator established to assess how close ecosystem types are to collapsing (losing vital aspects of their structure, function, or composition). For the NBA 2025 (as for the NBA2018) the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) framework was applied systematically across all terrestrial ecosystem types. Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories. The categories are based on assessments of quantitative and qualitative criteria (and thresholds) linked to ecosystem extent, ecological condition and threatening processes. Read more about this indicator on the About ecosystem threat status page.\nNearly one-third (141/463) of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems, representing 11% of the remaining natural habitat of South Africa, are threatened. Among these 63 are listed as Critically Endangered, 68 as Endangered, and 10 as Vulnerable (Table 1). Many of these ecosystems are concentrated in the key economic hubs, particularly in the south-western, north-eastern, and north-western regions of the country, where anthropogenic land-use activities and associated degradation pressures are major drivers of ecosystem change. Many of these threatened ecosystems have naturally restricted distributions, and accelerated habitat loss over the past three decades in these regions has compounded their vulnerability to collapse (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. Changes to the National Vegetation Map\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, the National Vegetation Map has been refined, increasing the number of nationally recognised terrestrial ecosystems from 456 to 463. These boundary adjustments and the addition of new types have influenced both the potential/historical extent of some ecosystems and their threat status categorisation. Refer to National Vegetation Map Project for more details on these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Summary of the assessment outcomes; including the number of ecosystem types per category and proportion of the natural areas remaining per category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory (IUCN RLE)\nNumber of ecosystems\nPercentage of threatened ecosystem types\nNatural extent remaining within South Africa in 2022 (km²)\nPercentage of the remaining natural extent\nPercentage of total terrestrial landmass extent\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered\n63\n13.6%\n9175.151\n0.9%\n0.7%\n\n\nEndangered\n68\n14.7%\n70047.437\n7.1%\n5.5%\n\n\nVulnerable\n10\n2.2%\n30431.996\n3.1%\n2.4%\n\n\nLeast Concern\n322\n69.5%\n871290.432\n88.8%\n68.9%\n\n\nTotal\n463\n100%\n980945.016\n100%\n77.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, the main pressures on terrestrial ecosystems include habitat loss due to croplands, human settlements and plantation forestry. Since 1990, croplands and plantations have not expanded significantly but human settlements continue to expand; these pressures are key factors in the Red List of Ecosystem assessments. Pressures such as invasive alien plants and rangeland overstocking are also important, degrading ecosystem processes and functions. New data on the distribution of invasive alien plants1–5 over large portions of South Africa has contributed to improved assessments, especially of Fynbos and Grassland ecosystem types (key message A4). However, there is still no comprehensive, spatially explicit dataset on land degradation for the country, which limits the ability to fully assess and track these impacts. For more about pressures in the terrestrial realm refer to the Terrestrial pressures page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Map (A) shows the historical extent of terrestrial threatened ecosystem types in South Africa, with the inset graph indicating the number of ecosystem types in each Red List of Ecosystems category. Map (B) Shows the remaining natural extent (circa 2022) of threatened terrestrial ecosystems; white areas represent non-natural areas such as croplands, built-up areas, mines, dams and tree plantations. The inset graph in (B) shows the percentage of the total remaining natural habitat (980,945 km²) within each category\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome level results\nA pattern first highlighted in the 2018 RLE assessment6 remains evident: threat levels vary widely across South Africa’s biomes. Fynbos and Grassland are most affected by human-driven and degrading pressures. In Fynbos, 40 ecosystems are Critically Endangered and 27 Endangered, together accounting for 53% of its 126 types. Grassland has 24 (33%) threatened ecosystems, encompassing four Critically Endangered, 14 Endangered, and six Vulnerable. These threatened ecosystems cover about 25% of the remaining natural extent in Fynbos and 28% in Grassland. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt is the most threatened biome, with all its ecosystem types listed as threatened. Other biomes face moderate risk, including Albany Thicket (nine threatened ecosystems, 20% of remaining extent) and Savanna (19, 7%). The Nama-Karoo is the least threatened, reflecting relatively lower pressure on its ecosystems (Table 2, Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

RLE assessments in the terrestrial realm will improve over time as data on ecosystem condition within forests and rangelands (including much of the Grassland, Savanna, Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo and Desert biomes) are gathered, validated and incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Threatened ecosystems per biome, showing (A) the percentage of ecosystem types per biome that fall within each threat category, and (B) the percentage of the total natural habitat remaining in each biome that falls within each threat category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvincial level results\nSimilarly, threat levels also vary considerably across the nine provinces of South Africa. Gauteng, the country’s economic hub, has the highest share of threatened habitat by extent (52%), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (39%) and Mpumalanga (34%). In the Western Cape, Limpopo and North West, approximately 15% of the remaining habitat is categorised as threatened, though there are many more threatened ecosystem types in the Western Cape, a product of the extremely high landscape and plant diversity. In contrast the Northern Cape, with its vast arid landscapes has only 11 threatened ecosystems (covering less than 1% of the remaining natural habitat), making it the least threatened province in the country, however, rapidly expanding mining footprints on the coast and interior combined with landscape level changes in plant community composition (linked to a combination of rangeland management, drought, climate change), are cause for concern (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

    "text": "Red List Index of Ecosystems\nThe Red List Index of Ecosystems (RLIe) tracks changes in ecosystem threat status over time7,8. The methods focus the indicator on genuine changes in status by accounting for the impact of improved data at later time points. RLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear, comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. RLIe was calculated for 463 terrestrial ecosystems at the biome level, across four RLE assessment periods: 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2024. The emerging trends reveal a complex picture of both resilience and vulnerability across South Africa’s biomes.\nThe Indian Ocean Coastal Belt has experienced the steepest decline and has the lowest overall RLIe, falling from 0.50 in 2014 to 0.43 in 2024. All ecosystem types in this biome are threatened and over time they are moving into higher risk categories. This steep downward trend reflects growing pressures from land-use conversion, including the expansion of croplands, urban development, and plantations. The Fynbos Biome, renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, faced substantial historical pressures resulting in low RLIe scores (0.62) but these are reasonably stable since 2018 suggesting that the main drivers of change, particularly agricultural pressure in lowland areas, have been entrenched for many years. In the Desert, Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes there are fewer threatened ecosystems and hence slightly higher RLIe (~0.8) but these scores have dropped substantially since 2014, suggesting accelerating pressures.\nAt the national level, South Africa’s overall RLIe declined slightly from 0.82 to 0.79 between 2014 and 2024, signaling a slow but steady increase in ecosystem threat. The divergent trajectories seen across individual biomes highlight the importance of targeted, biome-specific conservation efforts to address the primary drivers of change shaping ecosystem threat status across the country.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

    "text": "The moist, winter-rainfall region in the southwest of the country is home to the unique Fynbos biome. Adjacent to this lies the Succulent Karoo biome, an arid winter-rainfall biome with the highest diversity of succulent plants in the world. The Nama-Karoo biome covers the arid, summer-rainfall, central interior of the country. The Savanna biome dominates the northern and eastern summer rainfall regions of South Africa, and is the largest biome in Africa. The Grassland biome occurs mostly on the cooler high-lying central plateau and has high levels of plant endemism. The Albany Thicket biome occurs in the eastern and southern Cape and contains a unique combination of plant forms with an Eocene origin and unique evolutionary history4. The Forest biome is characterised by small patches distributed across the winter and summer rainfall areas of the country. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biome represents the southernmost extent of the moist tropical seaboard of East Africa. The Desert biome occupies a small portion of the extreme northwest of the country, forming the southernmost extent of the Namib Desert.\nThe vegetation map reflects the historical extent of the vegetation prior to major anthropogenic land conversion (ca. 1750). By estimating and mapping the extent and state of our natural ecosystems before large-scale human modifications we establish a baseline against which the state and extent of ecosystems can be monitored. In South Africa we have a wealth of information that allows for the approximation of historical extent5,6. The arid and mountainous character of much of South Africa also means that many landscapes have not seen extensive habitat loss - making estimation of historical extent feasible.",

    "section": "Seven broad themes for action",
    "text": "Seven broad themes for action\nThe fifteen key messages of NBA 2025 highlight a range of actions that can be summarised into seven broad themes:\n\nBiodiversity inclusive spatial planning (Key Messages A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, B4): Biodiversity and ecological infrastructure are powerful socio-economic engines contributing to South Africa’s development. The negative impacts on biodiversity, both direct (e.g., land clearing, built infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., pollution, changes to natural processes), from land and sea use change can be avoided or minimised through effective biodiversity inclusive spatial planning. South Africa has well-established provincial spatial biodiversity planning and prioritisation processes, plus screening tools for biodiversity sensitivity in development sites (Figure 1). Ongoing investment is needed to keep these plans and tools current with the latest biodiversity data, and ensure they inform decision-making at national, provincial and local levels. Marine Spatial Planning processes offer robust opportunities for biodiversity plans to influence use in the marine realm and along the coast. Biodiversity inclusive spatial plans can also guide ecosystem restoration and expansion of protected and conserved areas.\nPolicy development or refinement (Key Messages A3, A4, A7, B2, B4, C1): National, provincial and local policies and regulations unlock biodiversity and ecological infrastructure’s benefits to people. NBA 2025 identifies key sectors needing effective policies (providing required frameworks, incentives and governances structures) to address pressures on biodiversity. For example, policy gaps around pollution, freshwater flow requirements to marine environments and management of invasive species introduction pathways can be addressed through cross-sectoral approaches that strengthen interconnectivity between people and biodiversity. Closing these gaps requires strengthening collaboration between all levels of governments, particularly to local government where targeted capacity building and technical support is needed to help municipalities integrate biodiversity conservation and sustainable use responsibilities into their policies and operations.\nEnforcement and compliance (Key Messages A3, A7, B2, B5, C1, C3): Although South Africa has strong environmental policies, effective enforcement and compliance mechanisms are required to achieve biodiversity conservation outcomes. Compliance and enforcement reporting should be strengthened as this provides both impetus for implementation and means of monitoring progress towards targets. Limited capacity and budgets for compliance and enforcement are major challenges, and effective cooperation and innovative solutions are needed to transform the relationship between people and nature, address the underlying causes of non-compliance and enable adaptive management.\nManagement plans and programme/project implementation (Key Messages A1, A5, A7, B1, B2, B4, B5, C2, C3): Co-produced local management plans and projects/programmes are key tools for ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity, protecting livelihoods, and restoring nature’s contributions to people. Scientifically-sound project/programme design and robust project management are essential for cost-effective, successful implementation with lasting positive impact.\nInnovation, access to and transfer of technology (Key Messages A4, A6, C2, C3): Innovation is required to address pressures on biodiversity and persistent compliance and implementation challenges. For example, new approaches for legal wildlife trade may deliver better results than decades of enforcement efforts that have had limited success. Crucial investments include artificial intelligence and new technologies for remote sensing, data science and forensics, alongside fostering innovations in citizen science and stewardship of biodiversity. Building partnerships that facilitate exchange of skills, knowledge and best practice is key.\nData collection and monitoring (Key Messages A1, A3, A4, A5, B3, B5, C2): Effective biodiversity monitoring depends on continuous long-term data collection and analysis. Without this foundation, biodiversity inclusive spatial planning and biodiversity assessments are compromised. Interventions to mitigate pressures on biodiversity must be planned using the best possible data to ensure return on investment. Measuring impact through targeted data collection and monitoring enables adaptive management of current projects, informs future project improvements, supports meaningful reporting, and contributes to national datasets.\nInnovative financing and resource mobilisation (Key Messages C3): Current financial flows are insufficient for South Africa’s ambitious biodiversity targets. It is essential to ensure that the baseline funding for biodiversity is not eroded while exploring new sources. There is urgent need for coordinated action to scale up innovative public and private financing mechanisms. Blended finance models, biodiversity offsets, green bonds, and other nature-positive finance solutions can help bridge this funding gap, while partnerships with the private sector and development finance institutions can unlock considerable additional capital. Strategic resource allocation and measurable outcomes depend on investment in robust financial tracking systems, natural capital accounting, and transparent reporting.",

    "text": "The framing of action, response and intervention plans\nThe NBA 2025 presents a suite of findings that can inform diverse international, national and local biodiversity initiatives, providing context, indicators and avenues for intervention.\nAt the global level, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets 23 urgent targets for 2030 and four outcome-oriented goals for 2050. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration focuses on interventions to reverse biodiversity loss. The various assessments by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) guide global thinking on biodiversity trends and solutions (e.g., the IPBES Transformative Change Assessment emphasises that transformative change requires a redefined relationship between people and nature). The NBA provides national context and important trends in biodiversity for these processes, and contributes many indicators specifically needed to report against South Africa’s international commitments.\nNational initiatives include South Africa’s National Development Plan’s 2030 and SANParks’ ‘Vision 2040’which reimagines the role of conservation as a catalyst of redress, economic advancement and job creation through the Mega Living Landscapes. Furthermore, South Africa’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is being updated around four strategic dimensions: i) conservation (including formal protection, stewardship, OECMs, and targeted species efforts); ii) enhancing nature’s contributions to people (including inclusivity in the biodiversity economy); iii) mainstreaming biodiversity (across all sectors and levels of government and society); and iv) resource mobilisation (innovative, sustainable, and diversified strategies).\nThere are also many local, district and provincial-level initiatives under which actions, responses and interventions can be framed. South Africa has limited resources to implement these plans, and must capitalise on past successes, existing initiatives and strategic innovation to meet national targets for both biodiversity and development. The NBA can guide these initiatives and provide a wealth of data products to support decision-making.",

    "text": "Reflecting on twenty years since the first NBA\nThese seven themes have remained consistent across all iterations of the NBA, although each has been substantially refined and expanded over the years. Global and national approaches to biodiversity conservation and management have seen important, nuanced changes. For example, the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004 called for expanding the formal (i.e., state-owned) protected area network, but today’s approach recognises that very effective conservation also happens outside formal reserves through private landowner initiatives (e.g., biodiversity stewardship programmes) and community-led other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). The often repeated calls for better regulations and enforcement for certain pressures are now augmented by innovative technologies (e.g., satellite monitoring, AI-powered wildlife tracking), and the move towards a whole-of-society custodianship approach to nature. Similarly, the perennial challenge of inadequate funding has led to numerous diverse and innovative finance mechanisms for biodiversity and  greater focus on economic systems to benefit both nature and people. The NBA has grown in content and participation, and reflects how conservation thinking and practice has developed.\n\n\n\nIt has been 20 years since the release of the first NBA and the calls for action in NSBA 2004, NBA 2011 and NBA 2018 are all still relevant. The various intervention plans that are co-produced or updated after NBA 2025’s release, in participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, could reflect the past calls to action, while using the modern nuances of biodiversity conservation and nature’s contributions to people",

    "text": "South Africa has assessed the threat status of 25 474 indigenous taxa from 15 taxonomic groups using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria, which reflects a species’ extinction risk. There are several extinct categories, three threatened categories (Critically Endangered [CR], Endangered [EN], Vulnerable [VU]), as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD) and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range restricted endemic species that have a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km2 occurring where there are no anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are priorities for inclusion in national conservation interventions despite them qualifying as Least Concern under the IUCN system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered Brenton blue butterfly (Orachrysops niobe) (a), known only from Knysna, has been listed as possibly extinct, with the only known population lost during the 2017 Garden Route fires where the extensive spread of woody invasive alien plants were the main driver of the intensity and extent of the fires (© Justin Bode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of 20 sandy beach invertebrates have been assessed for the first time in NBA 2025 and the giant granulated calloused beach pillbug (Tylos granulatus) (b) is one of four Endangered species, with much of its habitat along the West Coast being impacted or lost due to mining, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp (© Linda Harris).\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the assessed taxa, 0.5% are extinct or possibly extinct (122 taxa ) and a further 3 659 taxa are threatened with extinction (14%). South Africa has high levels of species endemism – 75% of freshwater crab, 67% of plant, 57% of spider, 56% of amphibian, 52% of butterfly, 49% of freshwater fish, 44% of fairy shrimp (Anostraca), 38% of reptile and 36% of seabream taxa are endemic. For all of these groups, levels of threat to endemic taxa are higher than for all indigenous taxa (Figure 1). Overall, 20% of endemic taxa are threatened with extinction (3 213 taxa) and 0.8% are extinct or possibly extinct (120 taxa).\nThe most threatened taxonomic groups in South Africa are cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras), as 42 % are threatened. Most of these species are wide ranging and much of their decline can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other parts of the world. Six of the 13 species of endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened, indicating that the country has a responsibility to reverse declines of these charismatic predators. When only considering endemics, South Africa’s freshwater fishes are the most threatened comprehensively assessed group with 66% of species threatened due to competition with invasive alien fish and degradation of their freshwater systems through water abstraction, pollution and inappropriate sedimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Threat status of the 15 assessed South African taxonomic groups; categories follow the IUCN 3.1 Red List Categories and Criteria with an additional national category of Rare added for range-restricted, localised endemics that are not declining.

    "text": "South Africa has assessed the threat status of 25 474 indigenous taxa from 15 taxonomic groups using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria, which reflects a species’ extinction risk. There are several extinct categories, three threatened categories (Critically Endangered [CR], Endangered [EN], Vulnerable [VU]), as well as categories for Near Threatened (NT), Data Deficient (DD) and Least Concern (LC). South Africa augments the IUCN system by adding a category for rarity (Rare), defined as range restricted endemic species that have a global extent of occurrence of less than 500 km2 occurring where there are no anthropogenic pressures. Rare species are priorities for inclusion in national conservation interventions despite them qualifying as Least Concern under the IUCN system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered Brenton blue butterfly (Orachrysops niobe) (a), known only from Knysna, has been listed as possibly extinct, with the only known population lost during the 2017 Garden Route fires where the extensive spread of woody invasive alien plants were the main driver of the intensity and extent of the fires (© Justin Bode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of 20 sandy beach invertebrates have been assessed for the first time in NBA 2025 and the giant granulated calloused beach pillbug (Tylos granulatus) (b) is one of four Endangered species, with much of its habitat along the West Coast being impacted or lost due to mining, coastal development and associated artificial light at night, and removal of washed-up kelp (© Linda Harris).\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the assessed taxa, 0.5% are extinct or possibly extinct (122 taxa ) and a further 3 659 taxa are threatened with extinction (14%). South Africa has high levels of species endemism – 75% of freshwater crab, 67% of plant, 57% of spider, 56% of amphibian, 52% of butterfly, 49% of freshwater fish, 44% of fairy shrimp (Anostraca), 38% of reptile and 36% of seabream taxa are endemic. For all of these groups, levels of threat to endemic taxa are higher than for all indigenous taxa (Figure 1). Overall, 20% of endemic taxa are threatened with extinction (3 213 taxa) and 0.8% are extinct or possibly extinct (120 taxa).\nThe most threatened taxonomic groups in South Africa are cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras), as 42 % are threatened. Most of these species are wide ranging and much of their decline can be attributed to poor fisheries management in other parts of the world. Six of the 13 species of endemic sharks, rays and chimaeras are threatened, indicating that the country has a responsibility to reverse declines of these charismatic predators. When only considering endemics, South Africa’s freshwater fishes are the most threatened comprehensively assessed group with 66% of species threatened due to competition with invasive alien fish and degradation of their freshwater systems through water abstraction, pollution and inappropriate sedimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "section": "Species protection level",
    "text": "Species protection level\nSpecies protection level is used to determine how well the protected area network is conserving species. The indicator measures progress towards protecting a population persistence target for each species. As species persistence is dependent on the degree to which protected areas can mitigate threats that cause population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation. The categories for protection level are: Well Protected where the species persistence target is met or exceeded by the protected area network; Moderately Protected where between 50 and 99% of the species persistence target is met; Poorly Protected where between 5 and 49% of the species persistence target is met; and Not Protected where less than 5% of the species persistence target is met.\nThis indicator has been used to assess terrestrial and freshwater species within six taxonomic groups (Figure 3). Plants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 taxa. Peripheral taxa, which have less than 5% of their distribution range occurring in South Africa, were excluded from the analysis. Protection level has been calculated for 2 449 taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Protection level for six South Africa’s indigenous terrestrial and freshwater taxonomic groups. Analysis excluded peripheral taxa (those with less than 5% of distribution range occurring in South Africa). Protection level for all taxa (A); protection level for South African endemics (B). *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the protection level is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nExcept for freshwater fishes, South Africa’s protected area network protects species relatively well, with most groups having over 50% of taxa qualifying as Well Protected (Figure 3 A). The protection level of birds and reptiles is particularly good, with both groups having over 85% of their taxa qualifying as Well Protected.\nProtection levels of endemic species are lower than for all species (Figure 3 B). Freshwater fishes and amphibians have the highest proportion of endemic species that are Not Protected, 36% and 19% respectively. Endemic mammals are of some concern as 20 taxa (34%) are Poorly Protected and four taxa (7%) are Not Protected.\nThe effectiveness of protected areas in mitigating threats to species within their borders reveals some interesting case studies. While 38% of freshwater fishes are well represented within protected areas, many species are not being effectively protected due to the presence of invasive alien fish species within the protected areas’ freshwater systems and limited management interventions in place to control these invasive species. Pollution and over-abstraction of water upstream of the protected area boundary further compromise protection effectiveness. Consequently, only 23% of South African freshwater fish species qualify as Well Protected once the impact of these pressures is taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaubenya namaquensis, a rare and restricted range species from Namaqualand, experienced a genuine improvement in protection level status as a result of the declaration of new protected areas between 2018 and 2025 (© Nick Helme).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critically Endangered Cape Flats frog (Microbatrachella capensis) (© Kurt van Wyk) improved in protection level due to rehabilitation of wetland habitats within the Table Mountain National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor birds, 55 species (8.3%) experienced protection level category downgrades once effectiveness is included. The effectiveness adjustment reduces the protection level score particularly for wetland species (e.g., flamingos, cranes, pelicans) and raptors (e.g., vultures, harriers).\nAmphibians and plants are also significantly impacted by threats occurring within protected area boundaries. As a result, 7% of amphibian species and plant taxa drop down a category of protection. While amphibians are impacted by high levels of invasive alien species within protected areas, the main reason for plants not being effectively protected is due to high levels of plant poaching in the protected areas of Namaqualand.\nEighteen mammal taxa (7%) drop a category of protection due to protected areas not effectively mitigating against pressures; poaching and bushmeat hunting within reserves is a particular problem for mammals.\nThe Species Protection Level indicator has recently been adapted into the Species Protection Level Index, following the principles of the IUCN Red List Index of species. The index will be used for national and international biodiversity reporting. More details on the development of the index and the emerging trends can be found online.\nMany species have improved in their protection level since the last assessment in 2018. A total of 5% of plant species assessed have improved in protection level with the newly proclaimed Mountain Zebra-Camdeboo Protected Environment, Gamsberg Nature Reserve, and Orange River Mouth Nature Reserve contributing most to improving protection levels. Nine bird species (1%), four amphibian species (3%), nine freshwater fish species (9%), eight (3%) mammal taxa and seven (2%) reptile species have shown improvements in protection level. The improved protection level for reptiles is specifically due to the newly proclaimed De Hoop Dam and Mphaphuli Protected Environments and the Thengwe Nature Reserve, all in Limpopo.",

    "text": "Intersecting threat status and protection level\nWhile overall protection of species has improved, threatened species (CR, EN, VU) remain inadequately protected. Less than 30% of threatened amphibian, mammal and plant species, and only 5% of threatened freshwater fishes are Well Protected. On a positive note, nearly 60% of threatened bird and reptile species are Well Protected.\nSome species have benefited from the expansion of protected areas and targeted management interventions, however these successes are limited and most threatened species remain under protected. For example, the Endangered freshwater fish species the Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseudobarbus verloreni) has shifted from Not Protected to Poorly Protected following the declaration of a new protected area that now covers one of its populations. Unfortunately the broader pattern for freshwater fishes is that protected areas do little to shield species from ongoing pressures of invasive species, over-abstraction of water and pollution.\nSpecies threat status and protection level assessments provide a useful basis for guiding prioritisation processes. Highly threatened (Critically Endangered and Endangered) and under protected (Not Protected and Poorly Protected) species represent the most urgent need for conservation action, particularly when they are endemic to South Africa. Across all taxon groups 5% of taxa (127/2 449) fall into this category, and the majority of these are South African endemics (80%, 104/127 taxa). Freshwater fishes and amphibians have the highest proportion of species in this category, 27% (26/96 assessed fishes) and 13% (17/133 assessed amphibians), respectively. Both groups make use of freshwater habitats, which are also typically threatened ecosystems. Five per cent of plant species and close to 10% of all assessed mammal species are both highly threatened and under protected. Bird and reptile taxon groups have fewer species (less than 2%) within this category, and these species include habitat specialists and range-restricted species that require specific targeted protected area expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi) is Critically Endangered due to the high rate of loss and degradation of its preferred habitat, seasonal marshland, however, its Protection Level has improved from Not Protected to Poorly Protected, through concerted expansion of protected areas in Mpumalanga and southern KwaZulu-Natal (© Kyle Lloyd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clanwilliam sandfish (Labeo seeberi) is Endangered and Poorly Protected, as only one of its seven subpopulations receives protection in the Oorlogskloof Nature Reserve (© Jeremy Shelton)",

    "text": "Red List Index of ecosystems\nThe Red List Index of Ecosystems (RLIe) is one of the new headline indicators formally recognised in December 2022 as part of the expanded suite of ecosystem monitoring tools under the post-2020 Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). This indicator provides a systematic mechanism for tracking progress towards achieving Goal A of the GBF, which focuses on maintaining and enhancing ecosystem integrity.\nConceptually, the RLIe mirrors and complements the Red List Index8 (of species), offering comparable insights into ecosystem-level risk. It tracks changes in the threat status of ecosystems over time9,10, with all trend assessments derived directly from the outcomes of IUCN RLE assessments. This indicator reflects genuine changes in ecosystem status, accounting for improvements in data and understanding across assessment periods. Broadly speaking, the RLIe represents the mean of ordinal ranks assigned to each risk category and is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\nRLIE_t = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} W_{C_{i,t}}}{W_{C_O} \\cdot n}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(W_{C_{i,t}}\\) represents the risk category rank for ecosystem \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\).\n\\(W_{C_O}\\) is the maximum category rank (Collapsed = 5).\n\\(n\\) is the total number of ecosystems, excluding Data-Deficient and/or Not Evaluated ecosystems.\n\nRisk category ranks:\n\nCollapsed = 5\nCritically Endangered = 4\nEndangered = 3\nVulnerable = 2\nNear Threatened = 1\nLeast Concern = 0\n\nRLIe scores range from 0 (all ecosystems collapsed) to 1 (all ecosystems classified as Least Concern), providing a clear and comparable measure of ecosystem health across time and space. The indicator is designed for flexible application, allowing trends to be assessed for overall risk categories, or by individual criteria to reveal key drivers of ecosystem change. In addition, the RLIe can be disaggregated by South African biome for national reporting, or ecosystem functional group, aligning with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology10,11 for global reporting.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "A sufficiently resourced biodiversity sector is crucial to managing biodiversity for all. Resource constraints compromise the ability to understand, track and address the impacts of biodiversity loss and degradation on people and nature. To protect the country’s natural heritage for future generations, South Africa must move beyond business-as-usual and mobilise private sector investment and innovative finance solutions to fund biodiversity.\n\nDespite gradual increases in nominal public sector spending, South Africa’s Biodiversity Expenditure Review highlights a concerning trend that real expenditure (adjusted for inflation) is declining, eroding the purchasing power of existing resources. This fiscal pressure, compounded by South Africa’s constrained macroeconomic environment, poses serious challenges to achieving the country’s biodiversity targets under the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). \n\n\n\nManaging South Africa’s biodiversity is a collective effort that requires collaboration and resources, and moving beyond business-as-usual to diversified and innovative finance solutions (© Jeremy Shelton).\n\n\nTo address this, the Biodiversity Expenditure Review strongly advocates for diversifying finance flows, including expanding private sector engagement, unlocking green finance instruments such as biodiversity bonds, and fostering public-private partnerships. Private sector partners, particularly financial institutions, have a key role to play in mobilising resources and innovative finance solutions to support more positive outcomes for biodiversity. Funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund offer opportunities to scale up efforts for biodiversity and climate, and complement traditional funding mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and others.  \nThe move towards a more collaborative, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach is key to building an effective resource base for the biodiversity sector and to support positive biodiversity outcomes. This is underpinned by building strong partnerships, exploring new opportunities, strengthening institutions, and building capacity and skills. The Biodiversity Finance Plan for the third NBSAP will provide a clear, evidence-based roadmap to mobilise and align financial resources. Importantly, the country needs to standardise biodiversity tagging across all sectors to improve the tracking and reporting of biodiversity-related expenditures. This is the foundation of a sustainable biodiversity finance framework for South Africa, one that safeguards the country’s exceptional natural heritage, supports socio-economic development, and ensures long-term investment.",

    "text": "Biodiversity patterns and ecological processes are connected in complex ways that cross realms and human-constructed boundaries. Human activities in different sectors, each with separate policies and practices, can impact on the same biodiversity and ecological infrastructure in different ways. Coordinated and collaborative planning and decision-making is essential to account for this interconnectedness.\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives, and safeguarding biodiversity calls for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.\n\n\nBiodiversity provides benefits and essential services to people, like food, clean water and medicines, and enriches our cultural, spiritual and recreational practices. These services are dependent on intact ecosystems, healthy species populations and genetic diversity. The interconnectedness of biodiversity and human wellbeing is highlighted globally through the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity: conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of the components of biodiversity, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation. In South Africa, this interconnectivity is featured in the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity, which provides a vision for an inclusive, transformed society where biodiversity conservation and sustainable use ensure healthy ecosystems and equitable benefit-sharing for present and future generations.\nBiodiversity is fundamental to achieving South Africa’s national objectives of inclusive economic growth, job creation, and improved service delivery and wellbeing for all citizens. The National Development Plan calls for collective responsibility towards the biodiversity that underpins these national goals. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) can provide an opportunity for all actors in the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to work together and contribute to these national goals by strengthening the conservation of biodiversity; promoting and expanding the benefits derived from biodiversity; embedding biodiversity considerations across all sectors and levels of government and society; and strengthening financial and technical support for effective implementation.\nSouth Africa’s policy and legislative framework includes several tools to facilitate cross-sectoral planning and decision-making. Tools like Spatial Development Frameworks (developed at local, provincial and national level) and Marine Spatial Planning require multi-sectoral approaches to balance competing needs. Implementation of these frameworks, while sometimes challenging, can be improved by developing partnerships and working collaboratively. Some institutional arrangements already support this approach, for example, the Inland Water Ecosystem Liaison Committee, convened by the Department of Water and Sanitation, brings together all organs of state with shared mandates for managing and conserving rivers and wetlands. At the subnational level, catchment partnerships are an example of bringing together stakeholders from across government, civil society, research and the private sector to address natural resource challenges in a way that supports social and economic development. Collaborative action across government, all sectors and society towards a more nature positive and inclusive pathway will enable interconnectedness, resulting in thriving ecosystems, species and genetic diversity driving economic growth and wellbeing for all.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "South Africa has made progress towards expanding protected areas to be more ecologically representative of ecosystems and species (well established). Spatial biodiversity planning tools continue to guide strategic expansion efforts. By enabling better participation in conservation and restoration, addressing gaps in sustainable finance and enhancing effectiveness of protected and conserved areas, pressures on ecosystems and species can be further mitigated.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has committed to expanding protected and conserved areas, to meet national and global goals. Realising this ambition will require strengthened community participation in establishing and managing these areas. Areas such as Gompo’s Rock (near East London, Eastern Cape) (© Kerry Sink), which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance could be explored for conservation and recognition as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in partnership with value holders.\n\n\nExpanding the ecological representation of ecosystems and species in protected and conserved areas strengthens their effectiveness in reducing pressures on biodiversity. South Africa has made progress in expanding protected and conserved areas, with spatial planning guiding the inclusion of diverse terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems and their species. For example, the marine protected area network is spatially efficient and represents 83% of marine ecosystem types across 5.4% of South Africa’s ocean. Despite these advances, gaps remain in achieving fully representative coverage, particularly for estuarine and freshwater ecosystem types. Restoration initiatives, including controlling invasive species, could also increase effectiveness of these areas in protecting ecosystems and species. However, resources and capacity for management have not increased alongside the expansion of protected and conserved areas. \nProtected and conserved areas provide multiple benefits, including supporting sustainable jobs in tourism and the biodiversity economy, enhancing cultural and recreational experiences, and contributing to climate resilience and human wellbeing. Effective management of existing protected and conserved areas will ensure that progress made in expansion of these areas continues to deliver these benefits. Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework calls for the conservation of 30% of land, waters and seas by 2030 at the global level, with attention to effectiveness, ecological representativity and equitable governance systems. South Africa, with innovative resourcing strategies (see key message C3), is committed to all elements of the target. \nProtected and conserved areas work well with community involvement. Diversified protection models and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), can provide new opportunities for community-led conservation, livelihood diversification and cultural heritage protection. Initiatives that provide opportunities for communities living in and around protected and conserved areas to become active participants should be enhanced and encouraged. Combining aspects of both natural and cultural heritage in protected area expansion can foster the involvement of indigenous and local communities. Inclusive and participatory stakeholder processes are needed for more effective protected areas that support thriving people and nature. The biodiversity sector must strengthen capacity for social processes across institutions to create innovative partnerships with community and industry. Securing sustainable finance, enhancing institutional capacity, and fostering innovative partnerships with communities and industry are essential to ensuring that protected and conserved areas continue to deliver long-term ecological, social and economic benefits.",

    "text": "South Africa’s estuaries, rivers and wetlands remain highly threatened and under protected (established), despite providing many services that are vital to people. Achieving biodiversity conservation and socio-economic benefits will depend on innovative, integrated management of these ecosystems that combines regulatory enforcement with empowered community stewardship.\n\n\n\n\nThe Heuningnes Estuary in the De Mond Nature Reserve is one of South Africa’s 12 estuarine lakes (© Peter Chadwick).\n\n\nEstuaries, rivers and wetlands in South Africa are more threatened than ecosystems in other realms. Over 90% of estuarine ecosystem types are threatened and less than 10% are Well Protected. Over 60% of river and wetland types are threatened, while less than 10% are Well Protected. These ecosystems face multiple pressures from altered water flows, pollution, land-use changes, poor land management and biological invasions. Barrier structures, such as roads, and commercial forestry further alter stream flow, groundwater recharge, and hydrology of rivers and wetlands. In estuaries, the availability of cheap gill nets from online retailers has led to an increase in illegal fishing, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. This indiscriminate fishing method impacts many biota, such as sharks, rays, invertebrates, birds, turtles, terrapins, and crocodiles, beyond just the targeted fish species. Freshwater ecosystems and estuaries are complex and do not respond linearly to pressures.\nEstuaries, rivers and wetlands are essential ecological infrastructure for water security, food security, tourism, recreation, spiritual and cultural services, as well as disaster risk reduction and carbon sequestration. They are important havens for many threatened and endemic species. Improving their condition will increase the diversity of benefits delivered as well as the number of people who benefit from aquatic ecosystem services.\n\n\n\nRivers, wetlands and estuaries are essential ecological infrastructure for water security, food security, tourism, recreation, disaster risk reduction and carbon sequestration. Careful management and restoration of Strategic Water Source Areas, river floodplains and estuaries are essential for these benefits to continue. There is no buffer alongside this river channel, leading to extensive encroachment of human land uses into the floodplain, heightening risk to agriculture and downstream areas during flooding. (© Jeremy Shelton)\n\n\nThe dire status of South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems has been documented since the National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004. In response, ecological infrastructure, including rivers and wetlands, has received attention in various policy instruments, such as the National Infrastructure Plan and the pending National Wetland Policy. There have also been efforts to secure ecological infrastructure, and protect and rehabilitate rivers and wetlands. Estuary Management Plans have been or are being developed for more than 20% of systems. Most freshwater resources have been classified into levels of resource utilisation, although environmental allocations sometimes fall short of biodiversity requirements. However, these responses have yet to improve the threat status or protection level of aquatic ecosystems.\nInnovative approaches are needed that integrate social, economic and ecological considerations, and place people at the centre of environmental stewardship. Citizen science monitoring of aquatic systems is a powerful tool that assists communities to understand and appreciate these ecosystems, and the services they derive from them. In addition, the implementation of regulatory mechanisms such as environmental authorisations, water use licences and biodiversity offsets must include the requisite resources and capacity for compliance monitoring and enforcement. The recovery of fish and invertebrate resources in estuaries calls for a reduction in fishing pressure, prioritising ecological water reserves for estuaries, and increasing citizen awareness.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sufficient flow of clean water from land to sea is important for the functioning of coastal, estuarine and marine ecosystems, with implications for water quality, marine fisheries and coastal resilience to disasters (established). Sustaining the vital flow of freshwater to the sea requires an integrated approach that combines the management of flow, water quality and ecological and built infrastructure with coordinated efforts across all components.\n\nFreshwater flows into the ocean are essential for functioning coastal and marine ecosystems and the species that live in them. Estuaries demonstrate this interconnectivity between land and sea, and more than 20% suffer severely reduced freshwater flow and 32% are under severe pollution pressure. Flow reduction and poor water quality cause poor coastal ecosystem condition and increased species threat in the estuarine and marine realms. South Africa has very few (only 62) remaining free-flowing rivers that reach the coast without substantial barriers limiting flows and species movement. The water from many of the country’s catchments is already fully allocated for human uses inland, leaving ever decreasing volumes to flow into the ocean.  \n\n\n\nFreshwater reaching the sea is not wasted. Sediment-rich clean water, flowing from catchments through estuaries into the ocean, is essential and provides multiple benefits such as nutrients for fish and sand for beaches and dunes (© Darren Hanner). Actions have been identified to track progress in securing freshwater flow to the estuarine and marine realms.\n\n\nSufficient freshwater flow into the ocean maintains water quality, salinity regimes, and estuarine connectivity that supports fish nursery functions vital for marine fisheries. Freshwater flow enables the movement of sand and sediments, maintaining beaches and dunes, which are tourism and coastal resilience assets that help protect people from sea storms. Fisheries associated with muddy ecosystem types (e.g., prawns, sole) require mud delivery through freshwater flows to the sea. Species that move between marine and freshwater environments during their life cycle (e.g., eels [Anguilla spp.] and the commercially-important dusky kob [Argyrosomus japonicus]) are particularly vulnerable when estuarine connectivity and functioning are altered. \nEcological infrastructure, such as catchments, rivers and wetlands, together with built infrastructure, facilitates and regulates freshwater flows into the sea. A lead agency is needed to coordinate the development of an officially accepted standard protocol for the determination and implementation of flow requirements for fluvial-dependent marine ecosystems and resources. Then, alignment of strategies amongst stakeholders, such as the National Water Resources Strategy and Water Resource Classification, can ensure that flow requirements are implemented. Coordinated monitoring, data management and sharing will further support this effort. Investing in water resource monitoring and reporting is crucial to understand trends in streamflow quality and quantity, including associated declining estuary and coastal ecosystem conditions. Natural capital accounting, including the subnational water resource accounts and Strategic Water Source Areas accounts provides insights into how water moves across the landscape. Catchment Management Agencies play a key role by encouraging partnerships across sectors for collaborative water governance. Finally, coastal and estuary management plans must detail freshwater allocation, fish resource use, water quality management and appropriate land-use activities.",

    "text": "Multiple fishing pressures impact many aquatic ecosystems and species (established). There are opportunities to improve fisheries sustainability at the ecosystem, species and genetic level while supporting more fair fisheries. Fisheries management plans that apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries can allow fisheries resources to recover for the benefit of food security and livelihoods.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many recreational fishers in South Africa and improved management of this sector can support more fair fisheries (© Kerry Sink).\n\n\nFishing is one of the most enduring marine activities that supports food and job security. However, fishing exerts the greatest pressure on estuarine and marine biodiversity, with impacts on ecosystems, species and genetic diversity. Concentrated fishing pressure by multiple actors, including recreational fisheries, is the cause of ecosystem degradation in some areas and increases extinction risk of target and bycatch species. The many coastal species threatened by fishing include some endemic seabreams, several kob species and some invertebrates. Formerly common species like South African abalone (Haliotis midae), West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) and white mussels (Donax serra) are now Endangered due to overexploitation. Fishing has led to genetic consequences for seventy-four seabream (Polysteganus undulosus) and kob species (Sciaenidae). It also affects many seabirds, including the including the threatened African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), Cape gannet (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorant (Phalacrocorax capensis), and many sharks and rays. Fisheries management efforts have resulted in the partial recovery of some seabream species, including slinger (Chrysoblephus puniceus), carpenter (Argyrozona argyrozona) and Cape bream (Pachymetopon blochii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, Cape bream (Pachymetopon blochii) (© Joris van Alphen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB, Slinger (Chrysoblephus puniceus) (© Geoff Spiby)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverfishing has consequences for food security and livelihoods affecting small-scale, recreational and commercial fisheries. The marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers and has substantial yet unquantified impacts on marine biodiversity and other fishery sectors. Recreational fishers compete with small-scale and commercial fisheries, but remain largely unmonitored and ineffectively regulated.\nTo ensure fair and sustainable fisheries that support ocean life and human livelihoods, effective management plans based on scientific evidence should be implemented for all sectors, to manage the impacts on ecosystems, species, genes and people. Fortunately, the number of assessed stocks has grown due to new methods in stock assessment, and South Africa has made progress with ecological risk assessments. The country can expand on this foundation to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Better inclusion of recreational fisheries in policy and planning could reduce sectoral conflict and ensure equitable resource distribution. Key strategies include rebuilding overfished stocks, enhancing monitoring, and ensuring sufficient capacity for Red List and stock assessments. Specific actions should focus on reducing harmful practices, reducing bycatch, regulating (especially online sales/imports) and reducing gill net use, increasing compliance, improving spatial management, preserving genetic diversity, and promoting responsible resource use. Diversifying shark control measures can help reduce fishing pressure on threatened shark, ray, mammal and turtle species. Ensuring policy coherence and aligning monitoring efforts will be essential to manage growing demand and limited marine resources sustainably.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The negative impacts of pollution continue to increase in South Africa’s aquatic ecosystems, exceeding sustainable limits and affecting biodiversity, human wellbeing, and economic development (established). South Africa has advanced water policy, however, there is a need to strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement for aquatic ecosystems.\nSouth Africa’s rivers, wetlands, groundwater, estuaries and marine ecosystems are vital for water and food security, yet are compromised by pollution that contributes to a third of aquatic ecosystem extent being in poor condition. Half of South Africa’s estuaries have moderate to very high levels of pollution. The pollution originates from point and non-point sources, including agricultural return flow, discharge from wastewater treatment works, sanitation distribution networks, unmanaged urban stormwater, and other production and industrial processes. Poor solid waste management, particularly from rural and peri-urban areas upstream or near to water resources, also impacts water quality. Pollution disrupts the functioning of terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, compromising ecosystem services, causing eutrophication and oxygen depletion and local die-off of aquatic species, and often supporting uncontrolled spread of invasive aquatic plants. Emerging pollutants such as microplastics, persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PFAS1) and pharmaceuticals threaten water safety and aquatic biodiversity. Recent studies have detected DDT2 and other organochlorine pesticides in Lake Sibaya, coral reefs and offshore marine ecosystems.\nSouth Africa’s aquatic ecosystems have limited pollution assimilation capacity, which is being exceeded. Contaminated water has public health implications and reduces the availability of clean drinking water, and water of suitable quality for food production and other economic activities. Toxins from pollution accumulate in food chains, affecting both aquatic life and the human communities that depend on ecosystems for food security and livelihoods. These impacts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities who are directly reliant on natural water sources.\nSouth Africa needs to improve management of pollutants, particularly for wastewater, agricultural runoff, urban stormwater and emerging contaminants. With increased demand on water resources and considering the water-food-energy nexus, there is a need for alignment in policy, law and governance for integrated water quality management. Recent achievements include the publishing of the National Water Resource Strategy III in 2023, the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Coastal Marine Waters in 2022, and the Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill in 2025. These recent advances in water policy now require well-resourced action. It is vital to amplify current investment in modernising wastewater treatment works to ensure they meet current and future demands. Innovative urban drainage solutions should be instituted to improve stormwater management. Pollution levels in aquatic ecosystems should be effectively monitored. Water pollution is a complex developmental, economic, social, and environmental issue. Addressing it effectively requires an integrated, participatory approach and collaborative partnerships across all levels of society, including government, the private sector and civil society.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accelerated climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts on biodiversity and people, with increasing irreversible losses and disturbances (well established). Intact and well-managed biodiversity helps people to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Integrated solutions involving biodiversity, society and climate action are key to adapting to climate change.\n\nClimate change has caused irreversible losses of species and range shifts, as well as changes in ecosystem structure and disturbance regimes in all realms. More than 200 South African species have experienced severe population declines and increased extinction risk due to climate change, such as the iconic halfmens (Pachypodium namaquanum) and Namaqua dune mole rat (Bathyergus janetta). In the South African ocean, climate-driven shifts in prey species’ ranges contribute to a decline in seabird numbers and the worst coral bleaching in history is currently underway. Estuarine fish species (e.g., spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii) have extended their ranges by hundreds of kilometres, changing estuarine food webs. Climate change also amplifies other pressures on biodiversity such as biological invasions, habitat loss, pollution and changes to freshwater flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling up renewable energy is part of South Africa’s Just Energy Transition, and must be accomplished in a way that considers biodiversity. For example, this blade patterning experiment is ongoing at the Umoya wind farm in Hopefield, where painted blades show reduced bird fatalities (© Robert Simmons).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruptive flooding is now a seasonal reality in several provinces due to climate change. In 2022, KwaZulu-Natal experienced extensive flood damage like the Umdloti beachfront in this image (© Ryan Daly). The Palmiet area was less affected thanks to the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project. The project had recruited EnviroChamps from the community to clear alien vegetation along the river and monitor for blockages of sewers and stormwater drains in the two years prior to the 2022 floods.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, climate thresholds have now been reached. The year 2024 was the first on record with a mean temperature more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean. South Africa will likely become drier in the west and have intensified rainfall events in the east, with the interior warming faster than the global terrestrial mean. Biomes will likely change (e.g., Fynbos and Succulent Karoo drier and Savanna more woody), and species extinction risk is likely to increase. Environmental cycles and ecosystem processes that humans depend on are changing. Rising sea levels cause coastal erosion and infrastructure damage; shifting fire regimes impact property and air quality; warmer temperatures threaten water quality through increased eutrophication; and extreme weather events like droughts, heavy rainfalls and strong winds undermine safety and livelihoods.\nGreenhouse gas reductions and biodiversity-friendly renewable energy remain important for mitigating climate change. Recognising the connection between climate, biodiversity and society helps to identify additional integrated solutions. Ecosystem-based adaptation is the use of biodiversity to help people adapt to and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Ecological infrastructure, such as wetlands, rivers, estuaries, coastal dunes and kelp forests, helps to protect people and built infrastructure from the impacts of extreme weather events. Well-managed ecological infrastructure can support resilient agricultural production and maintain a steady supply of water. Programmes that maintain and restore ecological infrastructure and ensure connectivity across landscapes and seascapes are cost-effective ways to preserve nature’s adaptive capacity. Investment in inclusive climate action that reduces risk and prioritises equity and justice is essential.",

In addition, there was also substantial new work that was accomplished between the release of NBA 2018 and the release of NBA 2025. The following is what is new in NBA 2025:\n\nExcellent progress has been made regarding automated condition assessments to support the NBA 2025 inland wetlands threat status; NBA 2025 provides interim regional wetland types while a rigorous update of the typology is underway to provide more detailed characterisations; and work towards a revised National Wetland Map remains ongoing using a multi-partner, mixed approach that integrates GIS-based wetland predictive modelling, remote sensing and specialist mapping and validation (both field and desktop).\nRiver condition data (PES) was updated nationally as part of a WRC project and this data was used to update and improve river ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe Marine Ecosystem Map Version 2023 is used in this NBA and represents a minor update to the 2018 map, with the reintroduction of a pelagic layer in deeper waters beyond the shelf. In the meantime, a data-driven framework for updating the map has been in development and will represent a more substantial update in time for the next NBA. Condition data was not updated, however assessment methods have been improved.\nThe new version of the Vegetation Map of South Africa, released in early 2025, informed the terrestrial ecosystem assessments.\nVarious research and mapping projects have made new data available on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien plants; these data have been used to improve terrestrial ecosystem threat status and protection level assessments.\nThe NBA shows trends in terrestrial ecosystem threat status with one of the world’s first applications of the Red List Index for ecosystems (RLIe), showing trends in ecosystem risk. The index can be disaggregated using national biomes or the IUCN Global Ecosystems Typology Level 3 – the latter useful for international comparisons.\nTrends in ecosystem protection level in the terrestrial realm are explored using the new Ecosystem Protection Level Index.\nThree new taxonomic groups have been included in NBA 2025: freshwater crabs, Anostraca (fairy shrimps) and spiders, and revised assessments of birds, mammals, reptile and amphibians have improved the Red List Index that tracks changes in threat status over time.\nBuilding on the efforts begun for NBA 2018, the genetic component of the NBA now pilots international indicators of genetic diversity.\nThanks to Statistics South Africa’s 2024 publication Experimental Biodiversity-based Tourism Estimates for South Africa, the updated Biodiversity Tourism statistics are used in the benefits infographic."

It is prepared as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute’s (SANBI) mandate, in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). The Act specifically states that SANBI ‘must monitor and report regularly to the Minister on (i) the status of the Republic’s biodiversity and (ii) the conservation status of all listed threatened or protected species and listed ecosystems’.\n\n\n\nThe NBA 2025 is the 4th edition released, and the first to be accompanied by a website\n\n\nThe scope of the NBA is broad, assessing biodiversity at the ecosystem and species level, and addressing aspects of genetic diversity. The assessment covers all of South Africa’s territory, across land and sea, including its subantarctic territory of the Prince Edward Islands. Information is organised by realm (terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine (benthic and pelagic)), and the cross-ream coastal zone and the subantarctic region.\nRead more about the purposes and uses of all the NBA products here.",

There are many ways that individuals become involved in the NBA, from contributing data or providing advice, to helping undertake analyses and being part of the author team. This fosters collective ownership of the assessment by the biodiversity community in South Africa; and this co-production of knowledge for the NBA enables scientists, practitioners and decision makers to work towards a common vision for priority actions and responses following the assessment.\nThe vast majority of contributions to the NBA is on a volunteer basis without any financial compensation from SANBI. Without these voluntary contributions from experts and institutions outside of SANBI, the NBA would not be possible.",

While the NBA findings also feed into other Multilateral Environmental Agreements, there are multiple shared indicators across the NBA and Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of the CBD.\nThe shift to delivering the NBA as a website allows for more regular updates of components as they become available, rather than waiting for an official release.

Although among the smaller of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries, which together contain more than two-thirds of the world’s biodiversity, South Africa ranks in the global top ten of countries in terms of plant species richness and third for marine species endemism. The country holds three of the world’s 36 recognised biodiversity hotspots, 31 Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance, including the subantarctic Prince Edward Islands) and the Agulhas Bank that is an equivalently unique marine ecosystem (Figure 1). Applying the international standard, South Africa has identified 263 terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), which are sites of global biodiversity significance. This network of KBAs is expected to expand over time as the marine realm is assessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Ecosystem facts\nSouth Africa has a wide range of bioclimatic, oceanographic, geological and topographical settings. Together, these support high ecosystem diversity and endemism. Almost 1 000 distinct ecosystem types have been described and for the purposes of the NBA these are grouped into four realms: terrestrial, freshwater (rivers and inland wetlands), estuarine and marine. The cross-realm coastal zone is made up of selected terrestrial and marine ecosystems and all estuaries, and the Subantarctic is made up of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Prince Edward Islands, 1 700 km south of mainland South Africa.\n\n\n\nTundra vegetation on Marion Island– part of South Africa’s subantarctic territory; waterlogged mires, fern-dominated slopes and coastal salt spray habitats can be seen. A colony of macaroni penguin (VU) occupy the habitat at the bottom left of the picture (© Stephni van der Merwe)\n\n\nTerrestrial realm: Nine biomes and 463 ecosystem types, approximately 80% of which are endemic.\nFreshwater realm: Highly variable rainfall supports diverse freshwater ecosystems; wetlands are classified into 82 distinct types, and rivers are classified into 222 distinct types.\nMarine realm: Exceptional marine biodiversity, represented by 163 distinct ecosystem types.\nEstuarine realm: South Africa’s 290 estuaries and 42 micro-estuaries are classified into 22 estuarine ecosystem types and three micro-estuary types.\nCross-realm coastal zone: An ecological definition of the coast is used for biodiversity assessments. It comprises 190 ecosystem types from the terrestrial (83 types), estuarine (22 types) and marine (85 types) ecosystem maps to form a cross-realm coastal zone.\nSouth Africa’s subantarctic territory consists of Prince Edward Island, Marion Island and surrounding maritime domain. There are five terrestrial and 29 marine ecosystem types.",

Note the logaritmic scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is rich in species (Figure 2) and is home to an estimated 67 000 animal species, although many invertebrates remain undescribed or undiscovered. The 2025 South African National Plant Checklist records 23 514 taxa and 21 539 species, of which 20 204 are indigenous. Remarkably, 60.5% of these indigenous species are endemic to the country.\nCurrent estimates indicate that South Africa harbours approximately 8% of the world’s non-vascular and 6% vascular plant species; and 10% of the world’s dung beetle, 7% of bird, 6% of bee, 5% of mammal, 3% of reptile, 2% of amphibian and 1% of freshwater fish species. In the marine realm, South Africa supports 15% of the world’s shark, ray and chimaera species, 15% of nudibranch, 13% of marine (bony) fish, and 5% of seaweed species (including brown, green and red algae). Several terrestrial invertebrate groups have high richness relative to global statistics, with South Africa hosting nearly 5% of the world’s butterfly, 4% of spider, and 3% of dragonfly and damselfly species.\nTwo-thirds of South Africa’s plant species are endemic, and its cycads represent 10% of the global species count with 92% endemism. Around half of the South African species of amphibians, butterflies, bees, spiders and freshwater fishes are endemic, as are nearly 40% of dung beetle and reptile species. Approximately 30% of seaweed species and 40% of South Africa’s estimated 10 000 marine animal species are endemic, the vast majority being invertebrates.\nMicroorganisms (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, fungi, viruses), an often-overlooked and largely unassessed group, are essential for healthy functioning of natural and agricultural systems in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given the country’s immense diversity of floral and faunal species, and that each species has its own array of microbial species associated with it, it is likely that these are also diverse. For example, it has been estimated that each unique vascular plant species in South Africa is associated with at least seven unique fungal species, implying more than 171 000 fungi species (an underestimate, as fungi associated with invertebrates are not included).\nFind out more in this downloadable biodiversity profile Factsheet.\n\nRecommended citation\nDayaram, A., Van der Colff, D., Mtshali, H., Klopper, R., Le Roux, M., Poole, C., Dlamini, T., Sink, K., Currie, J., Skowno, A., Jones, G., Khatieb, S., Mogajane, K., Hamer, M., Truter, M., Jacobs, A., Venter, F., & Seymour, C. 2025.

    "section": "Benefits of biodiversity",
    "text": "Benefits of biodiversity\nThe 2019 Compendium of Benefits of Biodiversity describes the how biodiversity provides multiple benefits to the economy, society and human wellbeing. The sections below contain a summary of key elements of the Compendium, with edits and some recent additional information. SANBI has prepared a series of factsheets on the benefits of biodiversity and links to these are provided within the relevant section:\n\n1. Biodiversity and jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa’s biodiversity provides substantial employment in a range of sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor every one job involved in managing and conserving biodiversity, there are five jobs in economic sectors that depend on biodiversity. This means that continued investment in biodiversity conservation helps to provide sustainable employment, contributing to one of South Africa’s primary national development goals.\nIn a study completed in 2019, it was estimated that jobs directly related to biodiversity totaled approximately 418 000. This was comparable to the number of jobs in the mining sector at the time and represented 2.6% of national employment. There was agreement that this was likely an underestimate, and that further work was needed to fully and correctly estimate biodiversity-related employment. Work is underway with Statistics South Africa on a Biodiversity Economy Satellite Account.\nImportantly, there are jobs dedicated to managing biodiversity and/or maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure (e.g. in protected areas or conservation authorities) and/or research, and for every one of these jobs there are approximately five other jobs that depend on utilising biodiversity – either consumptive or non-consumptive use. These utilisation jobs are in sectors such as fisheries, wildlife ranching, biodiversity tourism, traditional medicine, crop agriculture, biotrade and more.\n\n\n\nHealthy rangelands are vital to both livestock and wildlife ranching, and there are an estimated 245 000 jobs on these farms across South Africa (©John Power)\n\n\nMany biodiversity-related jobs are outside major urban centres and are labour intensive, contributing to rural development, poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. In a context where employment in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture is declining, biodiversity-related employment is based on a renewable resource that, if appropriately managed, can provide the foundation for long-term economic activity and growing numbers of jobs. This means that efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity should be seen not as a cost to the economy but as an investment in a resource that supports wider economic activity and employment.\nDownload the Biodiversity provides jobs factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Biodiversity and food security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity is essential for food security.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity plays an important role in commercial agriculture, which supplies food in large quantities to the majority of the population.\nNatural patches that surround farms are the source of pollinators and natural enemies of agricultural pests. Fruit and vegetable crops, which are often pollinated by animals, contain nutrients that are important for health. South Africa is unique in that it uses two indigenous sub-species of bees for pollination, which are far more disease resistant than managed alien honey bees used in other parts of the globe. Natural predators also help to control pests that destroy crops.\nMore than 70% of South African land is used as grazing for livestock or game, sectors that are extremely important to the South African economy because only 11% of our agricultural land is suitable for cultivation.\nIn many parts of South Africa, people rely on foods collected directly from the wild, including 1 300 edible plant species and many edible insect species.\nNumerous coastal communities rely on subsistence fishing for food, and South Africa’s 22 commercial fisheries extract many tonnes of seafood from the ocean annually.\n\n\n\nApproximately 147 coastal communities in South Africa participate in small-scale fishing, and the marine recreational fishery includes at least 700 000 anglers (© Ryan Daly).\n\n\nIn addition to direct benefits, there are numerous soil, nutrient cycling and water-related ecosystem services that create the necessary environment for productive agriculture and that support the harvesting of wild species for food.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Biodiversity and water security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa is a water scarce country, and healthy rivers and wetlands help to ensure the flow and quality of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) are the 10% of the land area of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini that supply 50% of water to these countries. They are a vital form of ecological infrastructure, feeding major dams and providing water that is essential for people and the economy, often in urban centres some distance from the SWSAs themselves. Sound science has been used to delineate SWSAs for surface water and groundwater, and to better understand their contributions and the pressures they face. Securing SWSAs will involve implementing a range of different mechanisms to protect, restore, manage and monitor them. Doing so across this small fraction of land will help to reduce risks to water security now and in the future. The benefits for water security will become even more important as South Africa adapts to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nSWSAs are vital ecological infrastructure for national water security (© Jeremy Shelton).\n\n\nDownload the Strategic Water Source Areas: vital ecological infrastructure for national water security factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Ecological infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEcological infrastructure is as important as built infrastructure, especially for climate resilience and adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystems, climate and human society are all deeply interconnected. Healthy ecosystems act as living infrastructure that provides services such as filtering water, moderating floods, storing carbon, and helping communities adapt to climate change.\nEcological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that generate or deliver valuable services to people, such as freshwater, climate regulation, soil formation and disaster risk reduction. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is just as important for providing services to people and underpinning socio-economic development. Ecological infrastructure includes, for instance, healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. South Africa has abundant ecological infrastructure, providing opportunities to support development and unlock economic potential. Ecological infrastructure’s value is seldom captured in market transactions and we tend to under-invest in it. Some examples of the range of benefits provided by ecological infrastructure to the public are:\n\nSouth Africa is a water scare country, and ecological infrastructure such as healthy catchments, wetlands and riparian areas supports numerous water-related ecosystem services, including regulating the flow and quality of water;\necological infrastructure on the coast, such as dunes and kelp forests, provides protection of built infrastructure from natural hazards;\nestuaries are vital ecological infrastructure for food security, as they provide a nursery function for important fish species;\necological infrastructure, like wetlands, rivers and their catchments, coastal dunes and healthy rangelands, help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change (known as Ecosystem-based Adaptation); and can help to protect communities from the impacts of extreme weather events, and make the provision of food and water more resilient to changes in climate.\n\nMaintaining functional ecological infrastructure in strategically important areas will secure and improve various ecosystem services important to South Africans, enhancing investments in built infrastructure, complimenting national parks and protected areas, supporting rural development, job creation and job security, and supporting water and food security. Maintaining and restoring ecological infrastructure are cost-effective ways to lessen the impacts of climate change on society and the economy.\nDownload the 2023 Ecological infrastructure for climate change adaptation factsheet.\nDownload the 2013 Ecological infrastructure factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The biodiversity economy and innovations from biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSouth Africa has a growing biodiversity economy based on indigenous mammals and our unique flora.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are an estimated 10 000 wildlife ranches that engage in a range of commercial activities such as ecotourism, intensive game breeding, live game sales, trophy hunting and biltong hunting. Game meat and biltong are produced from 21 different species. The most recent estimates (2015) show that the economic contribution of the sector may be as much as R14.4 billion, directly providing 65 000 jobs. The fact that wildlife can be private or communal property has resulted in stable or increasing large mammal populations in South Africa. This industry relies heavily on biodiversity, and wildlife ranching is a vitally important land use for both socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. However, it can have negative impacts on biodiversity if conducted too intensively.\n\n\n\nFencing in wildife ranches allows for intensive management but carries an environmental cost (© John Power).\n\n\nA 2015 survey found that there are 549 retail products that contain South African indigenous plant resources and/or bee products from just 24 South African species. There is likely large potential for growth in the bioprospecting sector, with potential for more retail products that make use of resources from indigenous species.\nSouth Africa’s flora is world-renown and supplies important horticultural gems to the world. For example, our indigenous Strelitzia reginae (bird of paradise) flower was crowned the flower of Los Angeles in 1952. Species of the Cape flora, especially, rank among the world’s favourites. Breeders have invested huge effort and expertise towards the production of new and exciting ornamental and cut flower selections. Species and hybrids of South African genera that are in high demand are: Agapanthus, Arctotis, Crocosmia, Disa, Eucomis, Erica, Haemanthus, Ixia, Lachenalia, Leucadendron, Leucospermum, Lobelia, Mimetes, Nerine, Nymphaea, Ornithogalum, Osteospermum, Pelargonium, Protea, Rhodohypoxis, Serruria, Sparaxis, Strelitzia, Streptocarpus, Tulbaghia, Venidium, Watsonia and Zantedeschia. Many of South Africa’s indigenous plants are still awaiting research to unlock their full potential and maximise the opportunities offered by our exceptionally rich floral wealth to ensure that local people benefit from this potentially valuable resource.\nSouth Africa has a list of 1 593 taxa (species, subspecies and varieties), and 220 of these are priority indigenous taxa, that are important relatives of commercial crops around the world. These crop wild relatives are a vital resource of genetic material that can be used in plant breeding to enhance crop production. Several areas around South Africa have been identified as important areas for crop wild relative richness.\nBiomimicry is the process of learning from nature and emulating its forms and processes in engineered situations. Several biomimicry solutions have been gleaned from South African species, such as tougher ceramics based on the strong structure of abalone shells, wind turbine design based on whale flippers, and architectural cooling based on termite mounds.\nDownload the The Biodiversity Economy Project factsheet. This project was initiated in 2022 to expand protected areas across the country, while also ensuring that the communities located within and around these areas will reap the benefits associated with their local biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Biodiversity and tourism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTourism is a large and growing contributor to the South African economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country’s striking natural scenery and rich biodiversity are popular drawcards, with beaches, coral reefs, kelp forests, mountains and wildlife some of the top tourism attractions. Biodiversity tourism is tourism that involves the use or enjoyment of biodiversity. In 2019, domestic and international biodiversity visitors collectively spent R60.6 billion in South Africa, providing 91 836 jobs. Protecting South Africa’s wealth of biodiversity assets will safeguard one of the country’s most competitive tourism advantages, and ensure that biodiversity tourism can increasingly create revenue and jobs.\n\n\n\nIn 2019 biodiversity tourism contributed R27.7 billion to GDP (© John Power).\n\n\nDownload Biodiversity is a tourism asset factsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Biodiversity and health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity is important for South African’s health and everyday wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiencing nature has mental and physical health benefits and is important for South African’s everyday wellbeing. Studies show that natural green spaces can improve the mental health of urban residents, and an active outdoor lifestyle can promote physical wellness.\nNatural areas in cities can help filter out air pollution and reduce urban heat effects.\nThere are approximately 2 000 medicinal plant species in South Africa, and around 656 are commonly-traded. Remedies that use medicinal plants are based on centuries of cultural practice and indigenous and knowledge. The traditional medicine sector operates in parallel with allopathic medicine. Synthesising work undertaken in 2018 (a report done for SANBI title ‘Understanding the diverse economic value of medicinal plants to the South African economy’) revealed the following:\n\nTraditional medicines are used by 70% of South Africa’s people, are essential to the work of some 200 000 Traditional Health Practitioners and provide a further ~93 000 income generating activities in the informal sector for harvesters and traders.\nIt is estimated that the informal African Traditional Medicine (ATM) industry is valued at about R18 billion per year.\nAs much as 40 000 tonnes of medicinal plant raw material are traded per year in the informal sector.\n\nIncreases in volumes traded are having a negative impact of the threat status of a number of species – the Red List assessments from 2024 show that 143 medicinal plant species are threatened (14 Critically Endangered species, 44 Endangered, and 85 Vulnerable), and a further 69 species are of conservation concern (e.g. Near Threatened, Rare or Data Deficient).\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Biodiversity and cultural or spiritual practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBiodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many South African societies, people believe in a vital spiritual or cultural connection with an animal, plant or place. There is increasing evidence that interacting with nature brings measurable emotional and mental benefits to people as well as physical benefits, and that a decline in this interaction can cause deficits. Natural spaces and indigenous species have huge value and significance to South Africans no matter whether we live in an urban or rural environment. Biodiversity plays a key role in our overall perception of life, as well as a role in our enjoyment of life.\n\n\n\nNatural places are important for various cultural and spiritual practices (© Peter Chadwick).\n\n\nOur natural ecosystems, plants and animals have influenced our evolution and cultural and spiritual development. These influences are woven into languages and place names, as well as the religion and folklore supporting spiritual and cultural life. This web of associations with biodiversity forms an important part of South Africans’ national identity.\nSpecies with cultural or spiritual significance include Tulbaghia violaceace, Cymbopogon validus, Bucorvus leadbeateri and Lamprophis fuiginosus among many others.\nThere are some exceptional natural areas in South Africa that are associated with cultural and spiritual beliefs and are considered sacred sites. Examples include Mapungubwe Hill, Table Mountain, Gompo’s Rock and Lake Fundudzi. These sites, which hold both cultural and biodiversity significance, are a vital part of connecting communities to their heritage, and hold potential as other effective area-based conservation measures if they are not already under some form of protection.\nBiodiversity also provides opportunities for education (outdoor classrooms) and for ordinary citizens to contribute to biodiversity science across the country through citizen science initiatives.",

    "section": "The various products of the NBA",
    "text": "The various products of the NBA\nThe NBA’s products can be summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInput datasets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA has a strong focus on presenting spatial information (e.g. maps of ecosystem types, maps of ecological condition, species distribution maps, maps of threat status and protection level, etc.), and also makes non-spatial datasets available (e.g. species checklists). Each of these datasets are accompanied by their metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWorkflows for analyses and indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nA key focus of NBA 2025 was to ensure that the workflows for undertaking these analyses were published on repositories such as GitHub. This ensures that the NBA analyses are reproducible and mitigates any loss of knowledge or data should there be a change in staff undertaking the analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteResults of analyses\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of NBA analyses are usually indicators or other metrics, dispalyed as graphs or maps. These are all made available for users, with a recommended citation. Workflows and analytical code and documentation are available in various repositories (e.g. GitHub), technical reports are (available through FigShare, Dryad or similar, or SANBIs institutional document library - OPUS) and through publised scientific articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key messages distill some of the most important findings of the NBA in a way that is accessible to various audiences. Each key message includes a summary paragraph with a confidence statement. The messages draw on evidence from an NBA analysis (e.g. Red List status, ecological condition); describe why this is important (e.g. what are the consequences for people); and give some practical actions, responses and interventions that can be done. The key messages should be considered with their underlying data and analyses to inform sector-specific strategies and action plans, cross-sectoral planning and interventions, research strategies, scenario planning, and other action plans or response strategies that may be co-produced subsequent to the NBA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFacts and statistics about the benefits of biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the seven goals of the NBA is to highlight the benefits of biodiversity for people and the economy. There is a webpage on the ‘importance of South Africa’s biodiversity’ and each key message contains some information on why the finding is important. Links to additional information about nature’s contributions to people are also provided throughout the NBA website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePriority actions, responses and interventions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA indicators reveal potential avenues through which pressures on biodiversity can be reduced and biodiversity conservation outcomes and sustainable resource management may be improved. Each key message in the NBA makes a ‘call to action’ that addresses the finding and identifies specific interventions that could be considered. Through this process, the NBA contributes to the body of knowledge that enables the multitude of stakeholders to co-develop, through participatory whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches, the various policy responses and detailed action and implementation plans required for the benefit of both biodiversity and people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummaries\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch via surveys, consultations and a systematic review after NBA 2018 revealed that few users want a full printed synthesis book and that most users want to search for exactly what they are interested in. The move to the online website with regular updates is accommodating user needs. However, the value of a shorter less-technical printed booklet is still recognised for several reasons – including: it is a tangible product for high-level officials to showcase at a launch function; it provides media personnel with a colourful summary that may entice them into exploring certain NBA results more deeply; it serves to entice new users of the NBA into exploring the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePopular products\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other popular products are created from NBA results, and may depend on the audience – e.g. press releases, films, pre-recorded PowerPoint presentations, fact sheets, social media posts, conference presentations, popular articles, etc. Some of these items form part of the NBA Communication Plan, which is aimed for immediately pre- and post- the NBA release event, and are produced by SANBI and its NBA partners. However, all users of the NBA are welcome and encouraged to create their own popular products - making use of the results in ways that are meaningful for their particular audience.",

    "text": "Uncoordinated land- and sea-use changes cause biodiversity loss, degrade ecosystems and undermine the ecosystem services they provide (established). Biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services to support people and the economy. Strengthening collaborative, biodiversity-inclusive planning is essential to safeguard South Africa’s natural capital while enabling development.\n\nAcross the country’s landscapes and seascapes, habitat loss, fragmentation and declining ecological function are reducing the capacity of natural systems to deliver crucial services. On land, habitat loss is primarily driven by expanding human settlements and the establishment of new croplands, with over 100 000ha lost annually between 1990 and 2022. Encouragingly, the rate of loss shows signs of slowing since 2014. In the freshwater and estuarine realms, direct habitat loss from, for example, mining, croplands and housing developments, is a major pressure on aquatic biodiversity, alongside flow reduction and pollution. Direct habitat loss from mining and energy generation is relatively limited compared to other forms of land use (&lt;1% of land in South Africa), but intense, persistent and cumulative impacts often extend beyond the direct footprint, especially in aquatic realms where effects cannot be easily contained. In the marine realm, there are substantial direct impacts on biodiversity from coastal and offshore mining, and oil and gas extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand mining is an escalating pressure on the South African coast and in estuaries, impacting coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services. Mining can be seen on the beach in the foreground and on the adjacent dunes (© Jacque Smit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed land use, ensuring corridors for biodiversity, is possible in South Africa’s production landscapes, such as this plantation forestry landscape (© Endangered Wildlife Trust).\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment on land and in the sea is crucial for economic growth to address the country’s social challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. When these developments are positioned appropriately and managed sustainably, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation can be prevented. Healthy ecosystems are the foundation for South Africa’s social, economic, and environmental wellbeing. They provide essential services to sustain life and livelihoods such as clean water, food security, climate regulation and disaster risk reduction.\nSouth Africa has a strong foundation for systematic biodiversity planning and supportive legislation, but implementation gaps remain. Action is urgently needed to better integrate biodiversity into spatial planning and decision-making at all levels of government and across all sectors. Development decisions should be informed by the best available science and local knowledge, ensuring that future land- and sea-uses align with ecological sustainability. Strategic Environmental Assessments, updated environmental guidelines (such as the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline), and enhanced cross-sector coordination are required to manage cumulative impacts to safeguard species and ecosystems. By strengthening participatory, integrated, biodiversity-inclusive planning, and embedding biodiversity considerations into all development processes, South Africa can balance economic growth with the protection of its natural capital, securing the ecosystem services that are needed to support current and future generations.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "South Africa has over 3 500 alien species present outside of captivity or cultivation, at least a third of which are invasive (established but incomplete). New alien species arrive every year and those present in the country continue to spread and cause negative impacts. Better planning and monitoring are required to ensure effectiveness of interventions aimed at managing biological invasions for the benefit of biodiversity, people and the economy.\n\nSince 2018, South Africa has detected around three new alien species per year. Invasive species continue to spread and are found throughout the country. The national survey of invasive plants showed that coverage of selected invasive species increased by 10.6% between 2008 and 2023. Recent estimates indicate that 17% of terrestrial ecosystem types show greater than 10% cover by invasive alien plants. Biological invasions contribute to the listing of 31% of threatened terrestrial ecosystems, and 36% of all threatened species. \nInvasive alien species are having increasing impacts on nature, water security, people and the economy. Studies show that biological invasions use 3–5% of South Africa’s precious surface water runoff each year, which is a direct threat to water security in a water-scarce country. They also reduce the value of livestock production from natural rangelands by R340 million per year, impacting both food security and livelihoods.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s third national report The status of biological invasions and their management in South Africa (2022) provides important information and recommended actions (© SANBI).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive species, such as the black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) pictured here, are found across the country, impacting many Strategic Water Source Areas (© Tsamaelo Malebu). Efforts to improve water security by clearing alien plants in catchments are ongoing at various scales, For example, the efforts of the Greater Cape Town Water Fund has resulted in clearing of more than 46 000 ha of invasive trees in five years (2018-2023), with an estimated recovery of over 15.2 billion liters of water per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge of the distributions of alien plants has increased through the national survey, as well as through citizen science and the digitisation of historical records. Biological invasions have also been successfully managed in some cases, including through biological control, with positive returns on investment. Successful eradication includes the estuarine cordgrass (Sporobolus alterniflorus) from the Great Brak Estuary and the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from the Rondegat River. Prevention is crucial, through management of introduction pathways, particularly in marine systems where eradication is often unfeasible. Finalisation of the Ballast Water Management Bill is essential to preventing marine introductions. The establishment of the Border Management Authority aims to improve the prevention of illegal and accidental introductions. Management plans with clear goals and consistent monitoring will improve the effectiveness of invasive species control. Several global and national initiatives provide a framework for managing invasive species. These include the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 6) and the Invasive Alien Species Assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. At a national level, South Africa is guided by the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa’s Biodiversity and the draft National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan. With judicious investment and integrated governance, the impact of biological invasions on South African society can be reduced and any potential benefits researched and optimised.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Illegal harvesting and trade of South Africa’s species is increasing, with conventional law enforcement and legislative approaches failing to prevent population decline and near extinction of several species (established). Interventions that increase revenue within the conservation sector and contribute meaningfully to local livelihoods are required.\nSouth Africa’s rich biodiversity, combined with socio-economic challenges, has led to increasing illegal trade of numerous high value species in all realms. Around 9 500 southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum; Near Threatened) were poached between 2010 and 2023. Tens of thousands of plants of South Africa’s 37 cycad species (Encephalartos spp.), 71% of which are threatened, have been illegally harvested from wild populations in the last three decades – even from protected areas. A lack of effective guardianship of Endangered South African abalone (Haliotis midae) has seen an estimated 90% reduction in abundance over the past 35 years. The West Coast rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) has changed from Least Concern to Endangered largely because of illegal fishing. Official seizures and analyses of online trade show that reptiles, medicinal plants, seahorses, pipefish, sea cucumbers, marine gastropods (cowries, cone-shells, etc.), fish maw (swim bladders) and live ornamental aquarium species (including sharks, rays and corals), are being targeted. Some illegal harvesting methods (e.g., the use of gill nets for illegal fishing) are indiscriminate, affecting non-target species as well.\nSince 2020, illegal harvesting of ornamental succulent and geophytic plants, in high demand in Europe and Asia, has seen a dramatic escalation in the Succulent Karoo Biome where range-restricted endemic plant species are easily accessible and local people have limited livelihood opportunities. Over 1.1 million harvested plants have been confiscated, 632 species populations are in decline, and the populations of 12 endemic species have been reduced to functional extinction1.\nAddressing illegal wildlife trade through conventional law enforcement, focussed on stringent legislative measures such as trade prohibitions, is failing. For example, despite substantial enforcement, policy and management efforts directed towards curbing the poaching of rhinos, many have been killed within state-owned protected areas, leaving the private sector with the responsibility of protecting just over half the national herd. Similarly, 96 million South African abalone have been poached in 10 years, despite a severely reduced catch limit for the legal fishery. Many of the comprehensive response strategies and management plans, particularly for cycads and succulents, are severely under-resourced and poorly implemented, while conservation agencies lack resources for effective compliance measures.\nContributing to a sustainable biodiversity economy through legal trade offers a new frontier for addressing wildlife crime by supplying persistent demand whilst directly tackling socio-economic challenges and generating funds for conservation. Molecular techniques, such as DNA and stable isotope forensics, as well as the use of artificial intelligence, 3D printing and other accessible digital technologies that improve monitoring, training and databasing, provide innovative technological solutions for ensuring that trade is well-regulated and does not threaten wild populations.",

A whole-of-society approach is required for recovery efforts to meet national and international responsibilities.\n\nSouth Africa’s most threatened taxonomic groups are freshwater fishes, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) and succulent plants. Up to 66% of freshwater fish taxa are threatened, due to invasive alien fish and habitat modification. Other plants, reptiles, birds and mammals are also showing increased rates of decline over the past decade. More than 100 species have moved from Least Concern to threatened categories on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2018. The main cause has been population reductions linked to climate change (see key message A1) in the western parts of the country impacted by severe drought. The worst impacted region is northern Namaqualand, where endemic plants, beach macrofauna and reptiles have also experienced declines as a result of expanding mining activities. The increase in illegal trade has caused severe declines to species in use (see key message A6), including endemic plants, some marine invertebrates and cartilaginous fishes. Estuarine degradation, fishing and lethal shark control measures contribute to the threat status of cartilaginous fishes. Their decline is a global trend, yet with several endemic species, South Africa has a responsibility to protect them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) and green sawfish (P.  zijsron), were once common along the KwaZulu-Natal coast and in estuaries, but are now considered Critically Endangered within our waters (© Dennis King). Building on progress, South Africa can further diversify and modernise shark management measures to improve marine species status without unduly increasing risks to bathers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 55 plant species endemic to the Richtersveld region have been uplisted to highly threatened categories since NBA 2018 due to the combined impacts of climate change and rapidly expanding mining activities. All three species of tree aloes found in the Richtersveld, including this quivertree (Aloidendron dichotomum, Vunerable), were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2022 as threatened as a result of population declines due to climate change. (© Wendy Foden)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe threatened status of several nearshore marine species is of concern for food and livelihood security (see key message A5), as is the status of other species harvested for food and medicine. Species support crop agriculture, the wildlife economy, tourism and many other jobs. South Africa is a megadiverse nation and has committed to global efforts to address the species extinction crisis. Target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for a concerted effort to halt human induced extinction of threatened species and for the recovery and conservation of species.\nSouth Africa has many conservation tools available for species recovery. Sufficient resourcing is required to ensure Red List assessments are conducted and updated for all taxonomic groups at least every 10 years. Additional species information needs to be included in the National Environmental Screening Tool, particularly for the marine realm, and in Spatial Development Frameworks and Integrated Development Plans. In cases where species have experienced extreme losses and recovery is required, multiple partners need to work together. South Africa’s Centre for Species Survival and the IUCN National Species Specialist Group have developed and costed recovery plans that estimate a 10-fold increase in spending on species recovery is required for South Africa to meet its obligation under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Expanding protected and conserved areas and improving their effectiveness for under protected and threatened species remains crucial to safeguard South Africa’s rich species diversity (See key message B4).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The first assessment of genetic health based on two international indicators suggests declines in the genetic diversity of South Africa’s species (established but incomplete). More South African taxa need to be assessed to better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, and genetic richness analyses need to be incorporated into protected area expansion strategies.\n\n\nThe Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 4) uses the proportion of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 (Ne 500 indicator) to assess genetic health. Ne represents the number of breeding individuals in a population. When Ne is above 500, populations are large enough to sustain genetic diversity. Populations below this threshold lose genetic diversity, increasing their risk of extinction. An initial assessment of 126 species from various taxonomic groups in South Africa, across different ecosystems and threat levels, found an Ne 500 score of 0.42, meaning that 58% of assessed populations are below the threshold, suggesting substantial genetic erosion. These populations are smaller than is necessary to ensure their long-term persistence and the overall adaptive potential of the species. Alarmingly, even Least Concern and Near Threatened species showed poor genetic indicators, suggesting undetected genetic decline not captured by extinction risk assessments. Similar trends have been seen globally. A complementary indicator tracks the proportion of species’ populations still present (PM indicator). South Africa scored 0.95, suggesting that most populations of the assessed species have not yet disappeared. This offers hope that with effective management, the genetic health of South Africa’s species can still be recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) (© Tim Kuiper).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. The brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea) (© Endangered Wildlife Trust).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA and B: these two species are categorised as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, yet their genetic population size (Ne) may already fall below the threshold for long-term survival. Falling below the threshold of Ne &gt; 500 raises concerns about species’ abilities to maintain genetic health and adapt to environmental change.\n\n\nGenetic diversity underpins a species ability to adapt to environmental changes. Low genetic diversity increases extinction risk, especially under pressures such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, inbreeding, hybridisation, unsustainable use and poorly managed translocations. Safeguarding evolutionarily distinctive species will enable adaptive potential to be maintained within an ever-changing environment. \nTo better understand the full extent of genetic loss within South Africa, efforts are underway to assess complete taxonomic groups. Increased investment is needed in genetic monitoring (i.e., comparing genetic metrics at multiple time points) to acquire more precise estimates of genetic indicators. Additional indicators based on phylogenetic diversity (e.g., the EDGE index – evolutionarily distinct, globally endangered; and the Expected Loss of Phylogenetic Diversity indicator) are being piloted, and are important for ensuring that evolutionarily distinctive species are protected. Importantly, environmental impact assessments and spatial planning should integrate landscape-level genetic richness, particularly for threatened species, by using genetic data or their proxies in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, in systematic biodiversity planning and for strengthening the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nature’s contributions to people are at risk due to poor ecological condition of ecosystems and pressures on important species (established). Restoration and recovery programmes, that are guided by science, implemented collaboratively and properly monitored are essential to ensure lasting benefits for both people and nature.\n\n\n\n\nIt is vital that ecosystem restoration and species recovery programmes are designed scientifically, and then evaluated for their effectiveness so that future programmes are cost-effective and have the best possible results for people and biodiversity. Species recovery projects may involve costly translocation efforts – here some leopards are checked before their relocation (© North West Department of Economic Development, Environment, Conservation & Tourism).\n\n\nMore than half of South African ecosystems are in poor ecological condition. A particularly high proportion of wetland (51%), river (75%), estuarine (82%) and coastal (48%) ecosystem extent is Moderately to Critically Modified. Species also suffer from multiple pressures, including unsustainable use, poaching or other impacts from human activities (e.g., pollution).\nOften, the ecosystems and species that are most useful to people are those whose condition deteriorates the most. Wetland and river ecosystems provide people with essential water, and estuarine and coastal ecosystems are widely used for recreation, fishing and settlements. These ecosystems begin to lose their ability to provide these vital services as their condition deteriorates. In the same way, species that are used for harvesting or trade are susceptible to unsustainable use that threatens the resource. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 2) calls for 30% of degraded ecosystems to be under effective restoration by 2030 in order to enhance ecological integrity and recover the benefits people receive from ecosystems. Target 4 calls for the recovery and conservation of species, in particular threatened species. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification also sets targets to avoid and slow degradation, and restore degraded lands to a natural, productive state (also part of the Sustainable Development Goals).  \nPreventing species decline or ecosystem degradation should always be the primary focus. However, species recovery and ecosystem restoration programmes can be effective interventions when done in a responsible and scientifically sound manner. Prioritising where such initiatives should occur can ensure cost-effectiveness and lasting positive impacts for both people and biodiversity. Several recent initiatives focus on using spatial biodiversity data to scientifically plan restoration initiatives. For example, the National Coastal and Marine Spatial Biodiversity Plan has been used to identify strategic priorities for restoration in coastal and marine ecosystems, and South Africa’s Essential Life Support Action Areas map identified areas that should be prioritised for restoration on land. These efforts reiterate the value of spatial biodiversity information, such as the NBA threat status and protection level analyses, in supporting national priorities and actions. Species recovery initiatives should be equally well planned, as it is estimated that investments exceeding R1 billion are needed over the next five years to recover species under severe threat in South Africa (see key message B1). Monitoring and evaluating (see key message C2) of ecosystem restoration and species recovery interventions is crucial yet often neglected. Counterfactual impact evaluation and a national information system for restoration and recovery programmes are both essential for adaptive management, improving future projects and reporting meaningfully. Restoration and recovery should always be a collaborative effort, involving indigenous knowledge and a whole-of-society approach to future-proof programmes with diverse stakeholder expertise.",

Without monitoring, there is no way to know if efforts are making a difference or if targets are being met. Yet, data collection and monitoring are under resourced and uncoordinated. Investment in strategic and collaborative biodiversity monitoring will provide the evidence needed to guide adaptive management and ensure resources are used effectively.\n\nSouth Africa has several successful citizen science programmes, like the Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, programmes for water resource monitoring, and others, that generate invaluable biodiversity data and foster public engagement. However, gaps remain in the monitoring and detection of changes in species populations, ecological condition and community composition across realms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen science empowers individuals, schools and communities to contribute to biodiversity monitoring. Here a budding citizen scientist is taking a soil sample in a wetland area (© Tsamaelo Malebu).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Sisipho Njokweni, and intern with SAEON, takes part in a long-term marine invertebrate monitoring programme (© Safiyya Sedick). Occurrence data from this programme was served through the SeaMap Project, and are contributing to a more data-driven marine ecosystem map and spatial biodiversity planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring allows for a comprehensive understanding of a system or process by tracking trends across time and space. It directly supports decision-makers to identify emerging issues of concern and adjust management actions to address these. The collation of data from various field-based monitoring efforts supports reporting on the status of biodiversity at the provincial, national and international scales. Strengthening monitoring mechanisms and coordination will be crucial for driving accountability, transparency, and learning through the revised National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). A robust national biodiversity monitoring framework can play a pivotal role, and its success will depend on: i) the extent to which national indicators comprehensively reflect the goals and targets of both the NBSAP and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; ii) the degree to which the three spheres of government, non-state actors, and other stakeholders actively adopt and apply the national monitoring system in planning and reporting; and iii) the accessibility and openness of biodiversity data and metadata ensuring that information is shared widely, used meaningfully, and contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of South Africa’s biodiversity. \nBiodiversity monitoring can be advanced by investment in innovative technology and data science. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, are particularly useful for unobtrusively monitoring vast, inaccessible areas. Artificial intelligence can process and analyse large volumes of data to identify subtle changes in real-time, allowing for more proactive responses to emerging pressures. Biodiversity monitoring should also align with global best practices and build on existing international monitoring initiatives. Partnering with international institutions and initiatives will enable enhanced technical support, harmonised data collection standards, access to advanced technologies, and invaluable insights into the creation of data processing workflows. Monitoring should continue to harness the value of citizen science, which reduces data collection costs while increasing the scale of data collection. Citizen science has the added benefit of empowering individuals to contribute to conservation efforts and strengthening community involvement in addressing global challenges like climate change. Citizen science programmes require constant fund raising and awareness building, and coordinated campaigns to secure these efforts are essential.\n\n\n\nThe Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers (CREW) Programme has a dedicated network of citizen scientists who upload observations to iNaturalist. Five new species of Iridaceae were discovered and described in the past few years. Ixia embrahimii, Critically Endangered, is named after the CREW Cape Floristic Region Node Manager, Ismail Ebrahim, for his years of dedication to flora conservation. (© Ismail Ebrahim)",

The Act provides for several categories of protected areas, including Special Nature Reserves, National Parks, Nature Reserves, Marine Protected Areas, and Protected Environments. In addition, it also recognises World Heritage Core Sites, especially Protected Forest Areas, and Mountain Catchment Areas. The EPL indicator does include a narrow range of legally secure Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) as contributing to meeting protection targets (Figure 1) and, as additional OECMs are evaluated and mapped across the country they will be considered in the computation of the indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Protected Areas across South Africa’s mainland and EEZ (A), and in the Prince Edward Islands and associated EEZ (B).\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem targets\nIn previous national assessments, targets for ecosystem protection level in the marine, freshwater and estuarine realms were set to 20% representation. With the publication of the Global Biodiversity Framework (most notably Target 3), a 30% target has been adopted for the NBA 2025 ecosystem protection level indicator. The targets used in the terrestrial assessment are based on species-area curves per ecosystem type (targets range from 16% to 36%)3; these remain in effect for NBA 2025.",

    "text": "The trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognised indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLI). The RLI is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1 and, the lower the value, the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction, i.e., if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The RLI is calculated only for comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups or groups where a representative sample has been selected. Changes in status over time have been tracked for 13 taxonomic groups (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The Red List Index (RLI) for taxonomic groups assessed in South Africa. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time, e.g., note the sharp decline in sharks, birds, mammals and plants. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). The newly assessed group Anostraca (fairy shrimps) are threatened by degradation of ephemeral wetlands. *Due to the extremely high number of plant species occurring in South Africa, the threat status is calculated for a statistically representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\nIncreases in extinction risk are evident for most groups, but a marked increase in rate of extinction since the last assessment is evident from the change in slope of declines for reptiles, birds, mammals and plants (Figure 1). Increases in threat status for birds have largely been due to freshwater birds impacted by increasing levels of pollution and other forms of habitat degradation, while the main drivers of declines for mammals, plants and reptiles have been climate change and loss of habitat for mining and renewable energy developments. Most plants that have been uplisted due to increasing levels of extinction risk are found in the Northern Cape (Figure 2). The province was severely impacted by the drought over the past decade, and is experiencing ongoing pressure from mining, succulent poaching and renewable energy developments. The two groups at highest risk of extinction are freshwater fishes and cartilaginous fishes. Sharks, rays and chimaeras are included on South Africa’s RLI for the first time, with the majority having wide ranges that extend outside South African territory. Many of these cartilaginous fishes are long-lived, have slow growth and low reproductive output, and many are declining across their ranges due to overfishing (including from recreational fisheries and as bycatch from industrial fisheries), lethal bather protection measures and habitat degradation. Half of South Africa’s freshwater fishes are endemic, with many concentrated in Western Cape river systems. While only due for reassessment in 2026, the declining status of rivers and dwindling resources available for management actions where many of these species are concentrated likely means that they will continue on a declining trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The distribution and density of species (per km2) that have increased in threat status since NBA 2018, for A, plants; B, terrestrial and freshwater animals; and C, marine animals (including sharks, sparids and marine birds only). Plants in the Northern Cape’s Namaqualand region are under the most severe pressure from climate change related drought, mining and succulent poaching, while the impacts on terrestrial and freshwater animals are widespread but linked to areas with high habitat loss and degradation. In the marine realm, increased risk to species is attributed to multiple pressures with coastal mining, estuarine degradation, flow reduction, overfishing and lethal shark control measures contributing to worsening species threat status.",

Ecosystem types are placed into one of four categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) and Least Concern (LC); where CR, EN and VU together make up the threatened categories.

This reflects the poor ecological condition of wetland, river and estuarine ecosystems that are overwhelmed by a variety of compounding pressures, particularly, increasing disruptions to the hydrological regime and deteriorating water quality, with fishing being an additional pressure in estuaries. Similarly high levels of pressure are evident on the coast, with 71% of ecosystem types being threatened, comprising almost half of the coastal extent. In contrast, a relatively large proportion of marine and terrestrial ecosystem types are listed as Least Concern. This is in part due to the relatively low pressure on some ecosystem types (e.g., abyssal or remote mountain ecosystem types) and due to inadequate data on pressures in utilised ecosystem types (e.g., marine pelagic fishing and grazing pressures in rangelands).

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level\nEcosystem protection level measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. The indicator was developed in South Africa and has been used as a headline indicator in national reporting since 2005. Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined targets ranging from 16 to 32% (linked to the extent and condition of types within protected areas). Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about the indicator here.\nWetlands and rivers have the lowest overall protection levels of any realm, with over 80% of ecosystem types categorised as Poorly Protected or Not Protected (referred to as under-protected) (Figure 3). This is driven in part by the poor ecosystem condition of many freshwater ecosystems (only intact or moderately modified ecosystem extent contributes fully to the ecosystem targets). A high proportion of estuarine ecosystem types have some level of protection, but very few are considered Well Protected. Protecting estuaries is challenging, given the range of pressures that can impact them directly and their upstream catchment areas. Marine protection improved dramatically in 2018/2019 with the declaration of 20 new Marine Protected Areas – this translates into higher levels of protection within the marine realm when compared to the terrestrial realm. The marine realm has a small number of large ecosystem types that are under-protected and this results in a difference between the percentage of types in each category (Figure 3) and the extent of each category (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Number of ecosystem types in each protection level category in each realm (A), the percentage extent in each category in each realm (B) (for rivers length is used as the unit of extent, for all other realms area is used). In addition to the realms, the plot also shows results for the coastal zone, made up of estuaries and selected marine and terrestrial types, and the subantarctic territory of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial patterns of protection level reflect the geography of the protected area network: terrestrial ecosystem types around large national parks (e.g., Kruger National Park in the northeast of the country) are Well Protected (Figure 4 A). Under-protected regions on the mainland include the grasslands of the Free State and interior of the Eastern Cape, and the Nama Karoo. Other gaps in the protected area network are evident in the offshore eastern portion of the marine realm, the southern Eastern Cape coast and the Northern Cape coast (Figure 4 A, B). Most coastal ecosystem types are represented in protected areas, although only a quarter of the extent is Well or Moderately Protected. The Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area in South Africa’s subantarctic territory provides protection to most ecosystem types, with almost half the types being Well Protected, however, these comprise a small portion of the territory (Figure 4 E).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Combining the indicators provides an additional perspective on the status of South Africa’s biodiversity.\nThe outputs of spatially explicit ecosystem assessments, as conducted in the NBA, can provide an initial indication of priority ecosystem types by intersecting the results of ecosystem threat status and protection level. Ecosystem types that are highly threatened (Critically Endangered or Endangered) but under-protected (Not Protected or Poorly Protected) can be considered to be in urgent need of conservation action (Figure 5). Priority ecosystem types could need additional protection, focussed management intervention or could be restoration priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Highly threatened and under-protected ecosystems of the marine and terrestrial realms (other realms not visible at this scale).\n\n\n\n\nIn the marine realm, 17% (27/163) of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under-protected, prevalent on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge and parts of the Kwazulu-Natal Bight.\nA quarter of terrestrial ecosystem types (115/463) are highly threatened and under-protected. The Fynbos Biome and Namaqualand contain many Critically Endangered and under-protected ecosystem types while the grasslands of the interior and the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt have many Endangered and under-protected types.\nOver a third of river ecosystem types (82/222) and a third of wetland types (29/82) are highly threatened and under-protected. Lowland river ecosystem types and depression wetlands have the highest proportion of types in this combined threat and protection category.\nA third of estuarine ecosystem types (7/22) are highly threatened and under-protected.

Key pressures on biodiversity in each realm, informed by Red List of Threatened Species and Red List of Ecosystems assessments. The size of the bubbles indicates the relative importance (on a scale of 0-5) of each pressure class.\n\n\n\nIn the estuarine and marine realms, and in coastal areas, unsustainable use of biological resources (in this case overfishing of key species, along with associated impacts on non-target species) is a significant pressure on biodiversity. There is increasing illegal harvesting and trade of numerous high value species in the terrestrial and aquatic realms, with population declines and near extinction of several species. Overuse of rangelands, which results in loss of shrub and herbaceous cover and leads to increased erosion, is a direct pressure to terrestrial species and ecosystems and an indirect pressure on freshwater ecosystems. Key messages A5 and A6.\nModifications to natural systems such as changes in hydrological regime are major pressures on biodiversity in freshwater, estuarine, many coastal and selected terrestrial ecosystems. Over-abstraction of water and dam construction have direct negative impacts on species and ecosystems, and indirect impacts through disruption of important ecological processes such as sediment supply. Key message A7.\nChanges to fire regimes linked to management imperatives, climate (drought events and high winds) and an increase in fuel loads from invasive alien plants are important natural system modifications in the terrestrial realm that have a detrimental impact on biodiversity. Species that have evolved special adaptations to survive fire, such as certain lycaenid butterflies and Fynbos plants, struggle to cope with fires that have increased intensity and occur more frequently than in the past. South Africa’s iconic Brenton blue butterfly has likely gone extinct as a result of high invasive plant fuel loads in the Garden Route region of South Africa coupled with climate change linked intense wildfires.\nPollution of aquatic ecosystems from a combination of acid mine drainage, mining, industrial and urban wastewater, stormwater, as well as agricultural return flows, negatively impact water quality. When combined with flow regime changes, pollution represents a major additional pressure on freshwater, estuarine and coastal biodiversity. For example, freshwater bird species are becoming more threatened due to pollution. Key message A3.\nClimate change is an accelerating threat across all realms, and amplifies other pressures such as invasive species, disease, habitat loss, flow reduction and habitat degradation. Climate change may also be associated with more severe or extended droughts. Multiple indigenous terrestrial species from the western arid regions of South Africa have experienced significant population declines as a result of a severe extended drought over the past decade. Though impacts of climate change on biodiversity are best understood in the terrestrial realm, coastal and estuarine ecosystems are particularly at risk from extreme weather events, especially where human settlements limit the natural resilience of these ecosystems by encroaching into dune systems and the Estuarine Functional Zone. Key message A1.\nThe primary pressure in the terrestrial realm is direct habitat loss as a result of land clearing for croplands, plantation forestry, human settlements and mining. Mining is one of the main drivers of increased risk of extinction for reptiles, mammals, amphibians and plants, and several coastal ecosystem types in Namaqualand. Intensive agriculture, in the form of croplands and pastures, significantly impacts most terrestrial and freshwater species groups assessed to date. Key message A2.\nBiological invasions impact all realms, with predatory alien fishes substantially impacting indigenous fish species in rivers. A wide range of woody invasive plant species impact riverine areas, wetlands and mountain catchments in particular and cause severe declines to South Africa’s indigenous plants and amphibians.Key message A4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Key message A1.\nThe primary pressure in the terrestrial realm is direct habitat loss as a result of land clearing for croplands, plantation forestry, human settlements and mining. Mining is one of the main drivers of increased risk of extinction for reptiles, mammals, amphibians and plants, and several coastal ecosystem types in Namaqualand. Intensive agriculture, in the form of croplands and pastures, significantly impacts most terrestrial and freshwater species groups assessed to date. Key message A2.\nBiological invasions impact all realms, with predatory alien fishes substantially impacting indigenous fish species in rivers. A wide range of woody invasive plant species impact riverine areas, wetlands and mountain catchments in particular and cause severe declines to South Africa’s indigenous plants and amphibians.Key message A4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Key pressures on South Africa’s species. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, categorized by taxonomic group, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme.

    "text": "Ecological condition across realms\nEcological condition is estimated using a range of different approaches across the realms, but is essentially the product of spatially representing the various pressures exerted on biodiversity. Ecological condition in the terrestrial realm relies primarily on land cover change, invasive species and overgrazing data; cumulative pressure mapping is used in the marine realm; and a multi-criteria ecological condition framework is used in the estuarine and freshwater realms. The different systems were aligned as far as possible in the NBA to allow for cross-realm comparisons of ecosystem condition and unified terminology.\nThe marine and terrestrial realms are similar in terms of their relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (~70%). In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to local characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact (Figure 3). For example, the Cape lowlands have extensive winter field crops while the mountainous areas of the Cape see far less intensive agriculture; all bay ecosystem types, the shelf edge and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight are subject to multiple pressures while many deep-sea ecosystems beyond the shelf have yet to see extensive modification.\nIn stark contrast, freshwater wetlands and rivers, as well as estuaries, are predominantly heavily modified, and in poor ecological condition. These realms are geographically constrained, and pressures tend to concentrate. Only 18% of estuarine area, 49% of wetland area and 25% of river length are considered to be in natural/near-natural condition. Coastal biodiversity is also under particularly high pressure and approximately half of the ecologically determined coastal zone remains in a natural/near-natural condition.

    "text": "Ecosystem protection level results\nEcosystem protection level measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. Ecosystem types are assigned to one of four categories based on a set of predefined ecosystem targets (ranging from 16 to 32%)1,2. Well Protected (WP) ecosystem types are those where the extent target is met or exceeded within the protected area network, Moderately Protected (MP) types are those with between 50 and 99% of their target within the protected area network, Poorly Protected (PP) types have between 5 and 49% of their target within the network, and types with less than 5% of their target within the protected area network are categorised as Not Protected (NP). Read more about this indicator on the About ecosystem protection level page.\nOver three-quarters (76%) of South Africa’s 463 terrestrial ecosystems received some form of statutory protection. However, levels of protection vary widely; 121 ecosystems are Well Protected, 67 are Moderately Protected, 163 are Poorly Protected and 112 are Not Protected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This expansion reflects the declaration of new protected areas primarily through biodiversity stewardship programs. Other effective area based conservation measures (OECMs) have not yet been fully assessed and mapped in South Africa and it is likely that the Protected and Conserved Areas estate (including both PAs and OECMs) covers substantially more than 10% of the landmass. Key message B4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Protected Areas in the Terrestrial realm circa 2024\n\n\n\n\nBiome and provincial level results\nAt a biome level, most Well Protected ecosystems are concentrated in the Fynbos (38) and Savanna (27). The very large National Parks (Khalahari Gemsbok and Kruger) in the Savanna Biome and the extensive Provincial Protected Areas and Mountain Catchment Areas in the Fynbos Biome mean that protection targets for numerous ecosystem types are met or exceeded. The Forest Biome, which has a limited natural extent in South Africa, is Well Protected, in part due to regulations related to the National Forests Act4 and cultural practices. In contrast lowland Fynbos, grassland and Karoo ecosystems tend to be under protected (Poorly Protected or Not Protected) (Figure 3) reflecting the need to improve their representation in the protected area network (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Protection level map of terrestrial ecosystem types. The inset graph shows the percentage of ecosystem types that fall within each protection category.\n\n\n\nEcosystem protection patterns at the provincial scale largely mirror those observed at the biome level. The Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape contain the highest numbers of under-represented ecosystems within the protected area network (Figure 3), many of which overlap with the Cape Floristic Region, a globally recognised biodiversity hotspot with exceptionally high ecosystem diversity. In contrast, provinces such as Gauteng and Limpopo, which have fewer ecosystems overall, still exhibit a high proportion of under-protected ecosystems (Figure 2), highlighting persistent gaps in representation even where total ecosystem numbers are lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Approach\nTerrestrial ecosystem protection level was calculated by assessing the degree to which protected areas targets for each ecosystem were met. Land cover, invasive alien plant data, terrestrial ecosystem maps (vegetation map) and protected areas maps for 2018 and 2024 were cross tabulated, allowing the calculation for each ecosystem type: i) the full extent of the type, ii) the full extent of the type within the PA network, iii) natural remaining the extent of the type within the PA network (including invaded areas), iv) the extent of invasion by alien plants within the PA network for each type.\nThe extent of each type within the PA network was adjusted for habitat loss and invasion. The natural remaining extent within the PA network was adjusted downwards by subtracting 70% of the invaded extent within the PA network. This step ensures that effectiveness of PA network is accounted for to a degree by preventing areas heavily degraded by invasive alien plants from fully contributing to ecosystem representation targets.\nEcosystem protection level index (EPLI) calculation (Harris et al., in review) is based on the concept of the Red List Index of Species and tracks changes in protection categories between time points (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.

Three of the six ecosystem types making up the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Biome, and 40% of Fynbos ecosystem types (50/126) fall into this category. Within the Fynbos Biome, renosterveld ecosystems are particularly highly threatened and under protected (17/30 types), highlighting a general trend globally where fragmented lowland regions which have seen extensive habitat loss from cropland development and human settlement are rarely included in protected areas networks.

    "text": "1. South Africa’s freshwater fish conservation challenge\nFreshwater fish are among the most threatened species groups in South Africa, and the majority of the country’s endemic fish species are in ongoing decline. Key threats include human impacts on water quality and quantity, habitat destruction and the impacts of invasive species – threats that often act synergistically and can be compounded by climate change.\nIn 2024, as groundwork for the Reverse the Red World Species Congress, members of the National Freshwater Fish Observation Group (including SANBI, SAIAB, CapeNature, Freshwater Research Centre) undertook a rapid assessment of South African freshwater fish species most urgently in need of recovery action, including species with recovery efforts already underway. The focus was on species with an Endangered or Critically Endangered conservation status, and those with a declining population trajectory.\nAssessments were attempted for 26 described freshwater fish species, and 10 recognised genetically distinct lineages. Expert knowledge was used to identify priority conservation actions for each taxon, as well as the cost for implementing these actions. Assessments were completed for nine of the 26 described species and for five of the 10 genetic lineages; however, experts noted low confidence for several of these assessments. Furthermore, 12 of the taxa were not assessed at all due to insufficient expert knowledge.\nOf the assessed taxa: all were considered in need of management actions and/or associated research; 11 were identified as in need of ex situ breeding programmes; 10 taxa were expected to benefit from new stewardship sites; and all 14 were considered in need of further research to identify the most suitable recovery actions. Investment in freshwater fish recovery efforts over the past 10 years was estimated at R18 million – a figure that would need to be increased nearly tenfold (to at least R168 million) to meet the recovery needs of freshwater fish species in South Africa over the next 5-10 years."

Summary of key recovery efforts for South African freshwater fish over the past 5 years\nDespite the large knowledge gaps and investment required to recover these species, there are a growing number of freshwater fish recovery efforts underway, some of which have made measurable progress towards reviving some of the country’s most imperilled freshwater fish species. This section summarises key recovery efforts focussing on threatened South African freshwater fish taxa over the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus © Linda Harris\n\n\n\n\nTradouw redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli (CR)\n\n\nabstraction prevent successful recruitment, relocating them into off-stream “sanctuary” dams free of alien species, growing them until they reach a size that reduces predation risk, marking them with PIT tags, and then releasing them back into the wild once they are large enough to avoid predation by invasive fish like bass (Micropterus spp.). Progress to date includes the rescue of over 45,000 juveniles, the establishment of six sanctuary dams, and the reintroduction of over 5,000 “bass-proof” fish into the wild. An ongoing PIT tag study shows that up to 20% of these fish return to the Biedouw River with the annual spawning migration in spring, translating into a an estimated nearly four-fold increase in the Biedouw spawning sandfish population. In 2024/5, a habitat restoration intervention was undertaken to restore 9 km of critical sandfish habitat in the upper Biedouw River through the removal of invasive fish and plants, and the construction of a barrier weir to prevent future reinvasion. By combining an urgent on-the-ground head-start programme with longer-term habitat restoration, the project seeks to transition from emergency intervention to establishing self-sustaining wild sandfish populations.\nFunders: National geographic Society, Species Survival Commission, Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, IUCN Save our Species, Foundation Segre, European Union, Rufford Foundation, Ford Wildlife Foundation, Federation of South African Flyfishers, Mount Ceder, Bushmanskloof, Alu-Cab.\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus © Linda Harris\n\n\n\n\nTradouw redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli (CR)\n\n\nThis project is led by SAIAB, in collaboration with the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA), retired specialists, students and staff from Nelson Mandela University (NMU), and the Eswatini Department of Fisheries. All historical collection sites for the Orange-fringed largemouth bream have been resurveyed, revealing a substantial decline in both population size and area of occurrence. The main threats are invasion by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the lower Lomati River in South Africa, and pollution from gold mining in the upper river reaches in Eswatini. Based on these findings, the species has been reassessed under the IUCN Red List and uplisted to Critically Endangered (assessment under review).\nTo support recovery, farm dams within or near the Lomati catchment have been stocked with wild-caught and captive-bred individuals. To date, 23 dams have been stocked in Eswatini and South Africa (including dams within the Kruger National Park), with an estimated ~50% showing signs of success by 2025. Additional stocking has also been done in the upper river within the species’ historical range. The captive breeding programme has been highly successful, with &gt;30 breeding events producing ~1 500 juveniles. However, under IUCN guidelines, stocked individuals can only be considered part of the natural population once they persist independently in natural systems for at least ten years, as this species generation length is estimated as 3-4 years (active research underway to confirm this estimate). In total, more than 30 000 fish (wild and captive-bred) have been stocked in dams.\nWorking with local farmers has enabled access to suitable dams and logistical support. In Eswatini, engagement with the Department of Fisheries aims to support community-based dam management to prevent over-harvesting, as these dams provide food resources. Concurrently, multiple Master’s research projects are underway (2023–2027, NMU Saasveld) is study the age, growth and fecundity of the species to inform a sound long-term conservation plan. The current project phase ends in 2025, but key activities — including additional stocking, monitoring and completion of biological research — will continue to 2027.\nFunders: Mohammed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund.\n\nRecommended citation\nShelton, J., Cerrilla, C., Jordaan, M., Bills, R., Anderson, A., Brink, E., Raimondo, D.C., Chakona, A., Job, N., Van Der Colff, D., & Monyeki, M.S. 2025.

Of these, 56% (9 species) are threatened with extinction, placing sole responsibility on South Africa to protect and conserve these species (Meyer-Milne et al. in prep).\nThis assessment of Anostraca contributed to 58% of the global Anostraca IUCN assessments, making a sizeable contribution to the understanding of the current state of these temporary freshwater habitat indicator species.\nThe IUCN Red List Index (RLI) assessment revealed that Anostraca have the third lowest RLI score (0.84), making it one of the most threatened taxonomic groups in South Africa. This illustrates the need for further surveys of temporary freshwater systems in the country, to understand their drivers of threat better as well as guide efforts to prevent further losses.\nMajor threats to Anostraca are habitat loss and degradation due to urban and agricultural expansion, and mining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Density of threatened Anostraca species (10 x 10 km grid) based on sampling records across South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nFor the first time in South Africa, a comprehensive assessment of Anostraca species was conducted using the IUCN criteria and categories. This includes 38 species, of which 36 have been published and are presented here. The last two species will be included in future updates. Nine species were found to be threatened with extinction, of which two were assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). The latter species are both only known from their type collection series. Streptocephalus gracilis was last collected in 1898, while Rhinobranchipus martensi was last collected in 1989. Sadly, the type localities for both species have been severely modified (Meyer-Milne et al. in prep).\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The biotic and abiotic variables associated with these habitats differ substantially, and species are highly sensitive to specific habitat conditions. Consequently, anostracans are habitat specialists and ideal indicators of environmental change.\nA range of different temporary habitats and at different levels of inundation. © Betsie Milne, Musa Mlambo and Daksha Bills\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs). The RLIs is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct. The Red List Index of Anostraca was calculated for the first time for South Africa, and this group is relatively low on the RLI scale, with a value of 0.84. This indicates that the group has high levels of threat and that many species are at risk of extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for Anostraca taxa assessed in South Africa (RLI value = 0.84). The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). This is the first assessment for Anostraca, and it is only represented by a single point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nThe major drivers of threat to Anostraca species are habitat loss and degradation caused by urban- and agricultural expansion and mining. Due to the temporary nature of the freshwater systems that Anostraca species inhabit, they seldom exhibit wetland indicators to alert water resource protection. Their soils do not always display typical soil wetness indicators and obligate- or facultative wetland plant species are often absent. In the arid regions of South Africa, the surfaces of many pan systems are bare or rocky, while along the escarpment or other large rock formations, the rock pools go unnoticed when dry. As a result, these habitats and their unique aquatic fauna do not get adequate recognition to allow for their protection against ongoing pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s Anostraca species, based on the percentage of impacted threatened Anostraca species. Pressures are categorized using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and are ranked from the highest to the lowest percent of impacted species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. Speeding events by vehicles pose egg bank destruction – an unusual pressure unique to large pans in the arid regions of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational speeding in general, as well as speeding events like Pandamonium in the Bushmanland, and official land speed record attempts like Bloodhound on Hakskeenpan in the Kalahari, favour the large, flat, hard and arid basins of pans for speed racing. Vehicle movement on these surfaces disturb the top layer of the crust where the dormant eggs of Anostraca and other aquatic invertebrates are located, eroding their egg banks (Box 3).\nThese large temporary systems fill only every few years, and the highly specialised aquatic invertebrate communities survive dry periods through their resting eggs that are contained in the top few centimetres of the sediment. The eggs are extremely fragile and unable to withstand more than ~1 Newton of force, so they depend on an intact crust for protection. Disturbances to the crust can therefore destroy the egg bank, disrupt the hatching cycle, and threaten the survival of aquatic invertebrates in these habitats.\nSee the article “Land speed record’ racecourse threatens rare fairy shrimps at Hakskeenpan” for further details.",

    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nMany of the Anostraca species that are of conservation concern are considered under-sampled, as there are only a few experts actively conducting surveys, and the taxonomical skills to accurately identify the specimens to species level are scarce. Furthermore, the life history traits adopted by Anostraca to survive in their temporary habitats create an unpredictable sampling timeframe, which complicates sampling attempts. As a result, many promising potential habitat remain underexplored. Some of the important actions needed to address current knowledge gaps include:\n\nMany areas in South Africa and the subcontinent remain unsampled. Regional surveys specifically for Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Free State and North-West should be prioritised.\nActive search campaigns should be launched for the CR - Possibly Extinct species, Streptocephalus gracilis and Rhinobranchipus martensi, as well as for the Data Deficient species, Branchipodopsis scambus and Streptocephalus vitreus.\nGenetic studies are needed to unravel suspected species complexes, where great morphological variation exist, e.g., Branchipodopsis wolfi and Branchipodopsis tridens.\nDeveloping a standardised method to calculate population estimates for hatching trials, field research, monitoring, and ad-hoc sampling, which is a vital element during red list assessments.\nAttracting interest for branchiopod research and training more South Africans in branchiopod taxonomy skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4: Egg bank sampling is an effective alternative to live sampling in temporary freshwater habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnostracan eggs have species-specific morphologies, making them useful indicators of diversity and density in unpredictable habitats when live sampling is not possible2. © Betsie Milne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing soils collected from dry habitats (left) to run hatching trials (right), has successfully contributed to filling distribution gaps and describing new species. © Betsie Milne",

From their attempts, only four species were officially added to the IUCN Red list, because many species lacked information to be properly categorised and fully assessed. Considerable advances have been made in anostracan research in South Africa over the past few decades. In 2023, the first comprehensive assessment of South African Anostraca was initiated through the NRF FBIP Project REFRESH.

A high proportion (38 taxa or 66%) of these face an elevated risk of extinction, thus placing sole responsibility on the country to protect and ensure persistence of these species.\nAssessment of the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) indicated that freshwater fishes have the second-lowest RLI score (0.75) compared to other taxonomic groups in South Africa. This shows that it is one of the most threatened groups, consistent with the broader patterns of the vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems in the country.\nThe major threats to freshwater fishes are invasive alien fishes, pollution, excessive abstraction of water and habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Density of threatened freshwater fish taxa (10 x 10 km grid) based on distribution records.

    "text": "Threat status, trends and pressures\n\nThreat status\n\nThe Red List assessment of all freshwater fishes in South Africa was done in 2016/17. A comparison with all comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups in the country indicated that freshwater fishes have the second highest proportion of species that are threatened with extinction (36%), second to sharks, rays and chimaeras Table 1. Overall, more than half (53% or 62 taxa) of freshwater fishes in the country are classified as Taxa of Conservation Concern (ToCC) (Figure 1). Most of these taxa occur in the Cape Fold Ecoregion (CFE)1,2,ellender2017a?. Most concerning is that almost all the endemic freshwater fishes (88% or xx taxa) in the country are classified as ToCC (Figure 1 & Figure 2). The elevated risk of extinction for freshwater fishes correspond to the poor condition of rivers. Estimates from the freshwater ecosystem assessment indicate that 75% of overall river length in the country has been modified and over 50% of rivers are threatened. A reassessment of the Red List status for freshwater fishes in the country is planned for 2027 to integrate new information, including new species and distribution records, that has been generated from a number of projects that were undertaken since the previous 2016/17 assessment (See further details in Box 1). As these assessments are underpinned by correct taxonomy, ongoing work is focusing on expediting the resolution of the taxonomic statuses of selected priority groups ahead of the planned 2027 reassessment. Another important development over the last nine years was the establishment of the freshwater fish observation network that was constituted to provide a better coordinated approach to address the challenges that were identified in the 2018 NBA.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Taxonomic advances since the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest Red List assessment for freshwater fishes of South Africa was done in 2016/17. These findings were integrated into the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA 2018). Key outcomes of this assessment were the identification of substantial taxonomic gaps across several species, lack of ongoing monitoring and uncertainties about species distribution patterns; highlighting the need for targeted research. In response, several research initiatives, primarily led by NRF-SAIAB in collaboration with SANBI and other partners, were launched to advance taxonomic understanding and fill sampling gaps. These include the Topotypes Project (NRF FBIP), the BioGaps Project, the Waterberg Biodiversity Project (NRF FBIP), the Tilapia Mapping Project (DFFE & SANBI), the REFRESH Project (NRF FBIP) and the eDNA Project (WRC) that were initiated to fill the identified taxonomic and species distribution gaps.\nThese projects, some of which are still ongoing, have already yielded significant scientific breakthroughs: 28 new fish species have been formally described, 11 previously synonymised species have been revalidated, and several candidate species requiring further taxonomic investigation have been uncovered across southern Africa1,2,sithole20xxa?,sithole20xxb?,mutizwa2025a?,fricke2025a?. Major milestones for South African species include comprehensive genetic assessments and taxonomic revisions of the genera Pseudobarbus, Galaxias, Enteromius, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Anoplopterus, Sandelia and Glossogobius which have collectively increased the number of freshwater fish species in the country from 105 in 2016 to 139 in 2025Chakona? & Skelton, 2017,1,chakona2020a?,bronaugh2020a?,mazungula? & Chakona, 2021,kambikambi2021a?,zarei? et al., xx, xx, xx,Ramoejane2025a?,scheepers? et al., xx, xx. Several additional new species are in the process of being formally described for inclusion into the 2027 reassessment.\nStrategic research initiatives have significantly strengthened the evidence base for conservation planning in South Africa. The REFRESH project addressed critical sampling gaps and updated historical records for inclusion into future Red List assessments. The Waterberg Biodiversity Project expanded species occurrence data in a priority region and highlighted the role of existing terrestrial conservation areas in safeguarding the region’s unique ichthyofauna from escalating anthropogenic pressures3. In parallel, NRF-SAIAB is advancing the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a tool for long-term monitoring of freshwater fishes of conservation and socio-economic importance. However, the reliability of eDNA-based assessments depends on an accurate and resolved taxonomic framework. Continued efforts to address taxonomic uncertainty and uncover undocumented diversity, particularly for the Amatola-Winterberg, Southern Temperate and Zambezian Lowveld freshwater ecoregions of South Africa, remain essential as this has direct implications for future Red List Assessments and the broader conservation agenda.\n\n\n\n\nNRF-SAIAB students Xiluva Mathebula and Nkululeko Zuma using a seine net to collect Enteromius specimens as part of SAIAB’s ongoing freshwater fish research. © Mandla Magoro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXiluva Mathebula using a backpack electrofisher to collect fish samples in the Mnyameni River, Eastern Cape. © Mandla Magoro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new generation of NRF-SAIAB scientists, Dr Lubabalo Mofu and Dr Mandla Magoro, deploying the boat electrofisher for a biodiversity and fisheries assessment in Glen Alpine Dam (Mogalakwena River) in the Limpopo Province. © Albert Chakona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends (RLI)\n\nThe trend in species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index (RLI) of species4. The RLI indices are calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in Red List categories over time. The RLI value ranges from 0 to 1, with the lower value indicating rapid progression towards extinction. A value of 1 signifies that all taxa are Least Concern, whereas a value of 0 indicates that all taxa are extinct. The RLI for freshwater fishes of South Africa was calculated at 0.75, revealing this group to be the second lowest among all assessed taxonomic groups in the country Figure 3. This relatively low (compared with other taxonomic groups) RLI reflects a high proportion of species facing elevated extinction risk, reinforcing the urgent need for targeted interventions to secure remaining populations and promote recovery of species that have suffered severe reductions in distribution ranges and population sizes.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) trends for South African freshwater fishes (RLI value = 0.75). The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

A REFRESHing project underway to address gaps identified in the NBA 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nNRF-SAIAB and SANBI jointly led the REFRESH Project that was funded by the NRF-FBIP Programme. The project included freshwater fishes and six other taxonomic groups: fish parasites, freshwater crabs, large branchiopods, frogs and freshwater molluscs. The freshwater fish component mainly aimed at filling knowledge gaps and renewing data to support updating of management tools such as mapping of the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPAs), feeding into the screening tool and assessment of threat status following the IUCN Red List criteria. Sampling was done in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, and over 300 species occurrence records and over 165 COI barcodes were generated. The taxonomic statuses of a number of species in the genera Pseudobarbus, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Glossogobius and Enteromius were revised as part of this project, resulting in the description of six new species and revalidation of two species. Several other new species are in the process of being formally described. Four PhD students have graduated from projects directly linked to the REFRESH project, contributing towards human capacity development and transformation.\n\n\n\n\nREFRESH project logo, indicating the inclusion of seven taxonomic groups: freshwater crabs, amphibians, large Branchiopoda, freshwater fishes, freshwater fish parasites, Odonata, and freshwater Mollusca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Albert Chakona and Dr Pedro Bragança sampling in the Garden Route, Western Cape in search of biological material that enabled the description of the forest redfin Pseudobarbus Outeniqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandelia capensis, Cape kurper (DD), Upper Berg River, part of the Cape Fold Ecoregion represents a species complex, requiring taxonomic revision. © Jeremy Skelton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudobarbus swartzi, Gamtoos River redfin (VU), image taken in the Groot River, Eastern Cape province of South Africa. © Jeremy Skelton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNkululeko Zuma, Dr Martinus Scheepers and Xiluva Mathebula are conducting river sampling near Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal. © Mandla Magoro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressures\n\nMajor drivers of threat to freshwater fishes in South Africa (Figure 4) and emerging pressures that are being detected and are not yet considered in IUCN Red List assessments are described below.\nExisting pressures\nInvasive alien freshwater fish species\nSouth Africa is one of six global fish invasion hotspotsleprieur2008? and at least 55 freshwater fish species (alien and extralimital) have been introduced into novel environments in South Africaellender2014?. While invasive fish mainly affect native fish species through predation and competition, they can also have genetic impacts such as hybridization and be vectors for the introduction of pathogens and parasites. The group with the most severe impacts in terms of predation is the north American centrarchids (three species of black bass (Micropterus spp.) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Invasive rainbow trout is a common invader in headwater ecosystems due to its preference for cooler water and has invaded headwater habitats mainly in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Mpumalanga provinces. This is problematic as many headwater environments, especially those located in protected areas, provide refuge to threatened native fish populations. Many populations of smaller-bodied native species have been extirpated due to predation and competition by invasive alien species (IAS), especially in larger mainstream riversvanderWalt2016a?,chakona2020a?. Alien species also pose a risk to native species from a genetic perspective and an example here is the invasive Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which threatens the genetic integrity of the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) through hybridization. Historically, the main driver for alien fish introductions has been angling, but other significant pathways for invasion have been aquaculture, the ornamental fish trade, inter-basin water transfers, biocontrol and conservation translocations.\nInvasive fish populations are not limited to species originating outside the country as a number of indigenous species have established invasive extralimital populations outside their native ranges. Ill-conceived conservation translocations were historically a driver that led to the establishment of extralimital populations, some of which became invasive. For example, the Clanwilliam yellowfish (Labeobarbus seeberi) is a native cyprinid endemic to the Olifants-Doring system in the CFE, which has been translocated upstream of a natural barrier into the Twee River catchment to create a yellowfish sanctuary. While the yellowfish successfully established, they also had adverse impacts on the Critically Endangered and highly range-restricted Twee River redfin, Sedercypris erubescens. Presently, this redfin has been displaced from most of its native range by the Clanwilliam yellowfish and the Cape kurper, Sandelia capensis, another native CFE species that has an extralimital and invasive presence in the Twee catchment.\nAnother problematic native species is the African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus – LC), which was identified in the previous Red List assessment (2007) as an upcoming potential future threat, and it has spread as predicteddarwall2009a?. The native range of this species is the northern ecoregions, and it extends from the Orange River system in the west to the Mtamvuna, KZN in the east1. As a result of inter-basin water transfers and human-assisted dispersal, it now has an extensive invasive range in all the major river systems and many smaller coastal catchments of the Western and Eastern Capeweyl2016a?. While it favours large lowland rivers and floodplain habitats,ellender2014a? have shown that sharptooth catfish can readily invade sensitive headwater habitats. Both their ability to establish in these habitats and their impacts on sensitive headwater ecosystems remain poorly studiedweyl2016a?.\nTwo invasive freshwater crayfish species, Cherax quadricarinatus and Procambarus clarkii are present in several river systems in South Africa. Recent records indicate that these species are expanding their ranges in South Africa and other parts of the region without much control. Of particular concern is the recent detection of P. clarkii in the Western Cape Province, a region with the highest concentration of highly threated freshwater fishes in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Key pressures on South Africa’s freshwater fishes. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme. The size of the bubbles indicates the relative importance of each pressure class.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of habitat quality and quantity\nSouth Africa is a water-scarce country with many competing water users. While the National Water Act 36 of 1998 (South Africa, 1998) recognises the environment as a legitimate water user, environmental flow requirements and pollution mitigation measures are not consistently implemented or enforced on a national scale. While some species have a higher tolerance for polluted systems such as the African sharptooth catfish and several tilapia species, most other species are intolerant of polluted water, and this is reflected by the increasing incidences of fish kills due to mining effluent and poorly maintained and managed Waste Water Treatment Works (WWTWs).\nPollution in a range of forms, from agricultural and forestry effluent, domestic and urban wastewater, and industrial effluent, is impacting many freshwater fishes of conservation concern. Many rivers, especially mainstream and lowland reaches are impacted by pollution as 67% of rivers are considered degraded. For example, the Elands River (Inkomti system) flowing past Machadodorp to its confluence with the Crocodile River, is polluted due to a Sappi’s Ngodwana paper mill as well as the Machado WWTW and informal settlements situated close to the river. These sources of pollution are all impacting the Incomati suckermouth catfish (Chiloglanis bifurcus – CR)roux2017a?. The Elands River and its tributaries have been identified as a priority freshwater environment for fish conservation through the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) (Driver et al. 2012; Nel et al. 2011a; 2011b), however this needs updating to reflect the current state of knowledge. The Tradouw redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli – CR) is affected by hydrological modification, agrichemical pollution as well as poorly functioning sewage works that impact the Tradouw River downstream of Barrydalejordaan2017a?. The Krom River minnow (Pseudobarbus senticeps – CR), restricted to the Krom River system, has been extirpated from its historic range mainly as a result of IAS, while in the Assegaaibosch River, the population is impacted by excessive pollution from settlements in the sub-catchmentchakona2017a?.\nAnthropogenic pollution can be exacerbated by unsustainable water use patterns and over-abstraction of surface water sources Figure 5. Complete abstraction during the dry season can result in localised extirpations, as was observed for the smallscale redfin (Pseudobarbus asper). This species was historically widespread throughout the Gouritz and Gamtoos river systems in the CFE but presently persist as highly fragmented populations in larger tributaries. Sampling results suggest that it has been lost from mainstream habitat due to the impacts of invasive piscivorous fish, while two lowland river populations downstream of Towerkop Nature Reserve is likely extirpated because of complete abstraction of surface water during the dry summer season Figure 5. Lowland species such as Pseudobarbus asper are especially vulnerable to water abstraction impacts as there are often no refuge populations in upstream areas from where the species can recolonise. Examples such as these illustrate that impacts on habitat quality and quantity is a significant pressure on freshwater fish and driving the highly threatened status of many taxa. Alarmingly, these pressures are only expected to worsen under future climate change predictions, especially for the CFE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Upstream and downstream views of the same river downstream of Towerkop Nature Reserve, showing the complete loss of habitat due to water abstraction in summer. While the weir structure (middle image) is relatively small, it diverts all surface flow into a drop-in grate and pipe system which channels the water downstream for irrigation purposes. © Martine Jordaan\n\n\n\n\n\nExacerbated and emerging pressures\nFreshwater systems across the assessment region face an expanding list of severe threats. These include acid mine drainage and mining-related sedimentation and effluent spills, forestry activities, alien invasive fish and their translocation, road-related chemical spills, agricultural impacts, alien plant invasions and associated control activities. These impacts are exacerbated by failures in municipal water services, including non-functional sewage works and refuse dumping in sensitive areas of catchments. Illegal gold mining within sensitive riverbeds is a growing concern, directly damaging habitats that support already highly threatened freshwater fish species.\nSee Box X, Freshwater Species Realm.",

    "text": "Protection level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\nA protection level assessment was completed for 96 freshwater fish taxa in South Africa. Peripheral taxa with less than 5% of their range in the country were excluded. Freshwater fishes remain the most poorly protected of all assessed taxonomic groups: only 26% (25 taxa) are Well Protected, while the remaining 74% are under-protected — classified as Not Protected (17 taxa), Poorly Protected (33 taxa), or Moderately Protected (21 taxa). Among the endemics alone, 88% (49 taxa) are under-protected, and 68% (38 taxa) of these are threatened with extinction (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable).\nOne improvement since the previous assessment was for the Verlorenvlei redfin (Pseudobarbus verloreni, EN), which shifted from Not Protected to Poorly Protected due to the declaration of a new protected area that now includes one of its subpopulations. However, of the seven Critically Endangered freshwater fish taxa, four - the Treur River barb (Enteromius treurensis), Barrydale redfin (Pseudobarbus burchelli), Pseudobarbus senticeps and Galaxias sp. nov. “slender” are Not Protected. All these four species have extremely restricted ranges, sometimes confined to a single river reach or sub-catchment, and since 2018, no expansion of protected areas has included their distributions.\nThirty-three taxa are classified as Poorly Protected, with most also assessed as threatened or Near Threatened (25 taxa). Of these, 22 taxa are endemic to South Africa, meaning that the country is solely responsible for protecting these species. The primary reason freshwater fish remain under-protected is that the existing protected area network seldom includes headwaters, full catchments, or sufficient lengths of rivers to buffer key threats. Moreover, many pressures — such as pollution and water abstraction — originate upstream or outside protected areas and cannot be mitigated from within them. While some pressures, such as invasive alien fishes, can be partially managed in protected areas by installing invasion barriers such as instream weirs, or restricting harmful land-use activities, current protection remains inadequate for most freshwater fishes.\nA full technical report will be provided and uploaded soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 3. An improvement in protection for one amongst many needing increased protection – celebrating the small wins: Pseudobarbus verloreni\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verlorenvlei redfin Pseudobarbus verloreni (EN) is a recently described range-restricted redfin minnow. It is endemic to the Verlorenvlei catchment in the CFE where it was historically widespread throughout the catchment (Chakona et al. 2014). It co-occurs with two additional native taxa, Galaxias zebratus and an undescribed lineage of the Cape kurper, Sandelia sp. ‘capensis west coast’.\nCurrently, P. verloreni persists as three remnant populations (the Krom Antonies, the upper Kruismans and the lower Verlorenvlei River). Of these, the Krom Antonies River population appears to be the only one that is viable in the long term as the riparian zone and water quality in the Krom Antonies River sub-catchment is relatively undisturbed. The viability of the other two subpopulations is uncertain due to their small size and pressures elsewhere in the catchment. The lower Verlorenvlei River is polluted and heavily invaded by invasive species including largemouth bass (Micropterus nigricans), banded tilapia (Tilapia sparrmanii) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Water abstraction throughout the catchment is also a significant threat that affects long term persistence of isolated pools which provide refugia for all three native species in the intermittent Verlorenvlei system during the dry seasonchakona2019a?.\nIn a recent evaluation of the value of protected areas for conserving the freshwater fishes of the CFE,Jordaan2020a? found that P. verloreni was one of 19% of species that were assessed, and which did not intersect with any form of protected area. This, together with the severity of the threats facing the species, made the long-term survival of P. verloreni uncertain. The situation has however improved with the recent declaration of the Moutonshoek Protected Environment. This formally protected area intersects the upper Krom Antonies River and protects the headwaters of this river where P. verloreni is known to be present as a viable subpopulation. The declaration of the protected area also mitigates against proposed tungsten mining activity in the upper catchment. Threats such as water abstraction will be addressed as part of the management plan for the protected area and the risk of alien fish invasion is being mitigated by the proposed construction of an instream invasion barrier in the lower Krom Antonies River. This forms part of the Krom Antonies Restoration Project, led by the Freshwater Research Centre (FRC).\n\n\n\n\nPseudobarbus verloreni Verlorenvlei redfin specimen. © Albert Chakona",

    "text": "Species recovery\nAs part of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Target 4, signatories are committed to taking urgent action to halt human-induced extinctions, reduce species’ risk of extinction, and improve their conservation status by 2030. Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts to prevent and reverse species declines, recover and conserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity, particularly among threatened species. South Africa has initiated a process for each of the taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed following the IUCN Red List criteria, to identify and prioritise species that are in urgent need of interventions to promote their recovery to contribute to achieving the GBF Target 4 goals.\nHere we present the process followed for freshwater fishes see more details here",

    "section": "Monitoring",
    "text": "Monitoring\nFreshwater fish monitoring is mandated across provinces and is generally embedded within protected area management plans under provincial agencies. However, specialised capacity within these agencies has declined, with many taxon-specific posts replaced by generalist roles. There is also generally a strong focus on larger charismatic mammal species as many of these are subject to commercial utilization. Although monitoring plans exist, not all provinces have the expertise or resources to implement them fully across all taxonomic groups. Additional monitoring is undertaken by universities, NGOs and short-term projects, but no institution is dedicated to long-term freshwater fish monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 4. Provincial monitoring efforts – Western Cape – Cape Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Western Cape Province has an extensive protected area (PA) network. Each provincial reserve or reserve complex has a protected area management plan (PAMP), which sets out the conservation targets and associated monitoring requirements for the PA. Most PAMPS have freshwater fish and freshwater ecosystems as conservation targets and these are monitored on a three-year cycle to determine the status of freshwater fish communities, identify changes in threats and inform adaptive management. Data from these monitoring events serves to inform conservation actions, inform decision support and provide the basis for threat assessments and protection level analysis. A significant shortcoming here is that many priority freshwater fish species or populations do not occur within the boundaries of PAs and are thus overlooked. This gap is often filled by conservation NGOs that partner with provincial conservation agencies to fill monitoring and surveillance gaps in the landscape. Western Cape examples are the Grootvadersbos Conservancy Trust and the Nuwejaars Conservancy. Both agencies are currently focusing their efforts on the threatened Pseudobarbus redfin species and implementing monitoring and species recovery actions. In addition, the Freshwater Research Centre is implementing several species recovery projects aimed at CR and EN species in the southwestern Cape Fold Ecoregion.\n\n\n\n\nCapeNature staff Dr Martine Jordaan and Khayakazi Breakfast conducting a fish survey in Bokkeriver Nature Reserve. © Martine Jordaan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Albert Chakona and Dr Nkosinathi Mazungula from SAIAB sampling in the rivers of the Nuwejaars Conservancy in search of the novel freshwater fish taxa and to obtain distribution data for the compilation of a freshwater fish conservation and monitoring plan for the area. © Martine Jordaan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reduction in specialist capacity has led to a heavy reliance on external partners, whose expertise and continuity vary. Structured, continuous monitoring is critical, and its absence has already affected key initiatives: (1) conservation translocations of Enteromius treurensis into upstream reaches have been discontinuedroux2018?, (2) taxa such as Kneria sp. nov. “South Africa” (EN) remains undescribed and Enteromius anoplus (LC) species complex remain taxonomically unresolved, thus limiting effective assessment, and (3) sporadic project-based surveys suggest that some threatened taxa are persisting, but in the absence of structured monitoring, population trends remain unknown.\nThe River Eco-status Monitoring Programme (REMP) has replaced the South African River Health Programme (RHP), but its purpose is to assess river ecological condition by integrating abiotic drivers (hydrology, geomorphology, water quality) and biotic responses (fish, invertebrates, riparian vegetation) relative to reference or baseline conditions. It informs ecological categories, compliance with Resource Quality Objectives and early-warning thresholds. Where implemented, REMP provides assemblage-level rather than species-specific fish data. In many provinces, the programme has been curtailed due to funding constraints. For example, Mpumalanga Province once had three aquatic scientists but now has only one, making monitoring of freshwater fishes extremely challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 5. Provincial monitoring efforts – Western Cape – Cape Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nA monitoring and rehabilitation program is underway in the Olifants and Wilger Rivers, Mpumalanga Province, through a partnership between MTPA and Thungela Coal Mining. The project was initiated in response to an acid mine drainage spill event in the Upper Saalboom River that killed all fish species along 98 km of river, down to the Loskop Dam inlet. A breeding facility has been established at Loskop Dam Nature Reserve (Thugela Fish breeding facility), in response to the spill. This facility focuses on breeding nine indigenous fish species for reintroduction into the Wilger River. This ongoing initiative has been running since 2022. Reintroductions are ongoing, and intensive biomonitoring is being conducted to assess recovery. In addition to restocking, the project supports capacity building through knowledge transfer between experienced (including retired) staff and interns involved in the program.\n\n\n\nKey areas requiring monitoring:\n\nHistorical occurrence sites — Re-survey locations where the species was previously recorded (some as far back as the early 1980s) to confirm whether populations persist.\nHabitat condition — Collect standardised data on habitat quality to inform Red List assessments and quantify extinction risk.\nSampling gaps — Target under-sampled regions, particularly the Eastern Cape Province, where monitoring effort has been minimal.\nGenetic sampling — Collect subpopulation-level DNA samples to support BioBanking and long-term conservation planning.",

    "section": "Knowledge gaps",
    "text": "Knowledge gaps\nAlthough some progress has been made, considerable knowledge gaps still exist for a number of freshwater fishes from the Southern Temperate and Zambezian Lowveld ecoregions in the north-eastern sections of the country. Ongoing work is focusing on addressing taxonomic challenges for species in the genera Labeobarbus, Enteromius, Clarias, Kneria, Opsaridium, Anoplopterus, Ctenopoma and Microctenopoma.\nA better understanding of the biological and ecological requirements of newly described taxa is also needed. In many cases, ecological studies were completed before taxonomic revisions, and it is unclear whether all taxa within a former species complex share the same ecological and life-history characteristics. Examples are species such as the Pseudobarbus burchelli complex that has been shown to comprise four distinct species with allopatric distributions. This is the similar case for the P. afer, G.zebratus and E. anoplus complexes.\nFinally, although rehabilitation needs for highly threatened species are often known by taxon experts, they are rarely formalised into species conservation or action plans. Without such plans, local implementation is difficult and opportunities to secure external funding are often lost. See freshwater fishes recovery action that might address this knowledge gap in the future.",

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nRed List Assessment\nThe IUCN Red List criteria and categories are used to assess the threat status of species. Freshwater fish species were assessed in 2016, utilizing multiple workshops, including a three-day in-person workshop hosted by the South African Institute of Aquatic Biodiversity (NRF-SAIAB) in Makhanda, Eastern Cape, and funded by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). All available spatial data were collated, and experts reviewed specimen records related to these data. Incorrect data were georeferenced, with a high investment in updating all threatened species records. The freshwater fish checklist was based on a very specific definition of freshwater fishes and included species occurring in neighboring countries Eswatini and Lesotho. See further details in2.\nProtection level Assessment\nSpecies Protection Level Indicator\nThe species protection level indicator measures how effectively South Africa’s protected area network safeguards species. It evaluates progress towards achieving a “persistence target” for each species — the level of protection needed to support long-term population survival. Because persistence depends not only on the area protected but also on the ability of protected areas to reduce pressures that drive population decline, a protected area effectiveness factor is included in the calculation.\nSpecies are classified into four protection categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell Protected — ≥100% of the persistence target met\n\n\nModerately Protected — 50–99% of the target met\n\n\nPoorly Protected — 5–49% of the target met\n\n\nNot Protected — &lt;5% of the target met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicator has been applied to terrestrial and freshwater species in six taxonomic groups, including a representative sample of 900 plant taxa. Peripheral taxa with &lt;5% of their range in South Africa were excluded. Protection levels have been calculated for 2 449 taxa in total.\nHow the Indicator is calculated\nThe indicator has two components:\n\nRepresentation in protected areas— quantifies how much of a species’ distribution or viable population units fall within protected areas. This guides the prioritisation of species for protected area expansion.\nProtected area effectiveness— adjusts for how well pressures such as invasive species, poaching, inappropriate fire regimes or damaging land use are controlled. Not all protected areas contribute equally to species persistence.\n\nSpecies-specific conservation targets reflect either the area required to support a minimum viable population, or for freshwater fishes, the presence of at least ten viable subpopulations.\nScores for protected area effectiveness were developed with input from freshwater fish experts and protected area management agencies, based on species responses to management at specific sites.\nFreshwater Fish Reassessment (2025)\nThe 2025 reassessment repeated the previous method using the 2018 protection level as the baseline, with minor spatial data updates from a 2022 workshop. Updated protected area boundaries meant the 2018 protection level assessment had to be recalculated with re-applied expert scores. No taxonomic changes were included in this cycle. A full update incorporating revised taxonomy and new Red List assessments is planned for 2027. Although this interim update has limitations, experts confirm that the findings align with current field observations. A technical report outlining the full methodology and limitations will follow.",

The overall increase in the proportion of species threatened is an indication of many vertebrates and plants becoming more threatened. The only new taxonomic group included are the Spiders (2214 taxa) that have very low levels of threat at only 4%.\n\nFiguresData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

The main pressures driving threat status changes include agriculture (impacting 67% of threatened taxa), natural system modifications (61%), and biological resource use (45%), with habitat loss from croplands, plantations, and livestock farming being particularly severe. Species like Botha’s Lark face critical threats from the conversion of grasslands for agriculture.\n\n\nMammals\nA total of 20% of the 291 assessed terrestrial mammal taxa are threatened with extinction, with 42% of South Africa’s 28 endemic mammals facing this risk. The main pressures are habitat loss and degradation from agricultural and urban expansion (impacting 79% of threatened mammal taxa), climate change and extreme weather conditions (particularly prolonged droughts causing severe declines in small mammals), and over-exploitation and poaching. Renewable energy development is also emerging as a significant threat, particularly affecting bat populations.\n\n\nReptiles\nThe proportion of reptiles threatened with extinction has increased from 5% in 2018 to 8% in 2022. There are 407 reptile taxa in South Africa of which 155 are endemic. A total of 12% of endemic taxa are threatened. Declines are mainly due to habitat loss with agriculture impacting 80% of threatened taxa followed by residential and commercial development (46%). Species that have become more threatened since 2018 are facing escalating pressures from illegal wildlife trade and mining.\n\n\nAmphibians\nTwenty-one percent of the 135 assessed terrestrial amphibian taxa are threatened with extinction, with 35% of South Africa’s 26 endemic terrestrial amphibians facing this risk. The main pressures driving threat status changes are invasive and other problematic species (affecting 76% of threatened taxa assessed through diseases, habitat replacement by invasive alien plants, and wetland degradation), followed by natural system modification (64%) related to wetland drainage, and inappropriate fire cycles. Habitat loss and degradation from agricultural activities (57%) is also a significant pressure while climate change is becoming an increasingly important driver, although the impacts of this emerging threat are challenging to quantify.\n\n\nPlants\nSeventeen percent of the representative sample of 900 plant taxa are threatened with extinction, and one in five endemic taxa face extinction risk. Agriculture continues to affect the largest proportion of threatened taxa (68%), while invasive alien species (57%), illegal harvesting (28%), mining-related habitat loss (13%), and drought related mortality attributed to climate change (11%) remain significant pressures. Since 2020 326 plant species have been uplisted to higher categories of threat, 153 of these (53%) have been uplisted due to the impacts of climate change and drought in the north western parts of South Africa, with 124 of these simultaneously impacted by livestock overgrazing (38%). A total of 118 plant taxa (36%) were uplisted due to the impacts of illegal collection for the ornamental trade.\n\n\nSpiders\nSouth Africa is the first country to have undertaken a comprehensive assessment for spiders. This first assessment indicates very low levels of threat with only four percent of the 2,214 assessed spider taxa threatened with extinction. When compared to assessments for plants where 17% of assessed taxa are threatened and vertebrates where12% of taxa are threatened, on first assessment spiders may appear to be more resilient than other groups. There are, however, high levels of data deficiency with 37% of assessed spider taxa lacking sufficient taxonomic resolution and ecological data to assign a threat category. The overall threat level for spiders will therefore only be known once these data deficiencies are addressed. The major threats to spiders are residential and commercial development (impacting 69% of threatened taxa) followed by agriculture, particularly crop cultivation which impacts 62% of threatened species. Ground-dwelling species with poor dispersal abilities are particularly impacted by habitat loss.\n\n\nButterflies\nTen percent of the 800 butterfly taxa assessed are threatened with extinction, while 18% of South Africa’s 419 endemic terrestrial butterfly taxa face extinction risk. While butterflies were last comprehensively assessed in 2017, the leading causes of decline remain natural ecosystem modification (66%) due to inappropriate fire management and the spread of invasive alien plants, followed by loss of habitat to agriculture (60%). Monitoring by members of the Lepidoptera Society between 2017 and 2025 have shown that two species are no longer extant at formerly known populations. The Waterberg copper butterfly, Erikssonia edgei and the Brenton blue butterfly Orachrysops niobe are considered possibly extinct. The Waterberg copper has been lost from its former sites due to lack of burning of its grassland habitat and the Brenton blue butterfly was lost from its only known site due to unprecedented hot fires caused by alien fuel loads during the 2017 Knysna fires. These possible extinctions are of high concern given South Africa’s commitment to halt extinctions through our ratification of the Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Key pressures on South Africa’s threatened terrestrial species. This analysis presents the relative frequency of pressures affecting threatened species, categorized by taxonomic group, using the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme. The size of the bubbles indicates the percentage of taxa impacted by each pressure class. * Key pressures to plants were assessed using a representative sample of 900 plant taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nThe trend in terrestrial species status over time was measured using the globally recognized indicator, the IUCN Red List Index of species (RLIs)1. The RLIs is calculated for specific taxonomic groups based on genuine changes in taxa assignments to Red List categories over time. The RLIs value ranges from 0 to 1, where the lower the value the faster the taxonomic group is heading towards extinction – i.e. if the value is 1, all taxa are Least Concern and if the value is 0, all taxa are extinct.\nThe RLIs is calculated only for comprehensively assessed taxonomic groups or groups where a representative sample has been selected. Changes in status over time has been tracked for six taxonomic groups that occur in the terrestrial realm (Figure 3). Increases in extinction risk is evident for most groups, but a marked increase in rate of extinction since the last assessment is evident from the change in rate of declines for reptiles, birds, mammals and plants. Increases in threat status for birds has largely been because of increasing levels of pollution and other forms of habitat degradation, while the main drivers of declines for mammals, plants and reptiles have been climate change and loss of habitat for mining and renewable energy development (the taxa that have changed status and the reason causing the uplisting to high threat categories are included on each taxon page). Most of the declines to plants are taking place in the Northern Cape Province (Figure 4) with the Namaqualand region most severely impacted. Anthropogenic impacts from livestock farming, mining, and road construction are being amplified by climate change factors including an unprecedented nine-year drought (2011-2019), increased temperatures, and stronger winds that cause cascading desertification processes through soil erosion and sand burial2. This same region is being heavily impacted by illegal wildlife trade of ornamental succulent and geophytic plants. Animals that have increased in threat status are spread across South Africa but are concentrated in the areas with high rates of recent habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Red List Index (RLI) for terrestrial species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and a random sample of 900 plants. The slope of the line indicates the rate at which species within each taxonomic group are becoming more threatened over time. The lower the value, the faster the group of species is heading towards extinction (if the value is 0, all species are extinct). While spiders have not been repeatedly assessed, a single point for the RLI has been generated to show the relatively low level of pressure that this group is under.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

    "text": "Marine ecosystem types\nThe 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment used the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map (Figure 1) to assess the state of 163 marine ecosystem types around mainland South Africa. See the subantarctic territory page for an overview of the marine ecosystem types in the Prince Edward Islands. South Africa’s mainland maritime domain (territorial seas plus exclusive economic zone) extends from the dune base to 200 NM seaward, representing an area of approximately 1.07 million km2 and extending to a depth of about 5 500 m. The continental shelf width varies between ~2 and 260 km, and the shelf break depth ranges between 80 and 600 m, being terraced in places (de Wet and Compton, 2021). The Agulhas Bank is a 116 000-km2 triangular extension of the continental shelf that supports many endemic species. Shelf areas constitute approximately 40% of the mainland maritime domain with slope and abyssal ecosystems constituting the remaining 60%. South Africa has a coastline length of over 3 000 km. A separate coastal chapter covers the ecologically determined coastal zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Overview of South Africa’s 2023 hierarchical marine ecosystem classification with four bathomes (inner ring), 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (central ring), 58 Biogeographic Ecotypes (segments in outer ring) and 163 national Marine Ecosystem Types (not shown as a distinct ring). The number and relative width of each segment in the outer ring reflects the number of national marine ecosystem types nested within each of the Biogeographic Ecotypes. Where there is no number, there is only one ecosystem type associated with that biogeographic ecotype. Note that the shore and shelf do not separate into benthic and pelagic components but the deepsea includes overlapping benthic and pelagic layers. Adapted from Sink et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nThe 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map includes 128 shore and shelf ecosystem types which are considered benthopelagic, with 22 deepsea benthic and 13 deepsea pelagic ecosystem types (Figure 2). These 163 ecosystem types nest within 17 Ecosystem Functional Groups (Figure 2) that align with those of the IUCN GET, except for minor differences in terminology, and South Africa included Bays as a distinct group. The Ecosystem Functional Groups are nested within bathomes, which represent geomorphological depth categories equivalent to ‘biomes’ in the IUCN GET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nSince 2004, South Africa has followed an approach that iteratively improves the classification and mapping of marine ecosystem types1. The Marine Ecosystem Map is informed by a broad range of data (Figure 3) derived from many types of surveys, including bathymetric, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity research. It is a large collaborative effort and the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map was developed with contributions from 29 authors from 18 different institutions. The map classification follows a nested hierarchy and the 2023 version sought to align with the IUCN GET structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The range of data that are being used to inform revisions to South Africa’s Marine Ecosystem Map. Increased research and data science investment is improving the marine ecosystem classification and map to support spatial biodiversity assessment and management.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the Marine Ecosystem Map\nLike its predecessors, the 2023 Marine Ecosystem Map relied heavily on thematic approaches and expert-informed decision-making. Technological advancements are continuously improving our ability to monitor and survey ocean spaces, rapidly increasing the data available to characterise, delineate and understand marine ecosystems. Work is ongoing to update and improve the next version of the Marine Ecosystem Map, which will inform the following National Biodiversity Assessment.\nSANBI is implementing data and analytical frameworks to leverage the rapidly escalating volumes of ocean data to improve the Marine Ecosystem Map. This framework consists of a collection of scripted and documented workflows hosted in online project repositories. The scripted workflow components can be updated as new data or better methods become available, can be maintained despite turnover in staff and guiding experts, and are making inroads towards more transparent and reproducible science. This data-driven and reproducible approach has included collation of a suite of environmental gridded data layers and biodiversity survey datasets.\nIn regions where sufficient biodiversity data occur, the environmental layers and occurrence records are combined in statistical assemblage distribution models that estimate the co-occurring species assemblages and their preferred habitats, thereby predicting biodiversity patterns and characterising their composition. In regions where insufficient biodiversity data have been collected for the biodiversity analyses, gridded environmental layers are combined in environmental classifications (cluster analyses) to delineate unique habitats (Figure 3). The outputs from the assemblage distribution models and the environmental clusters are used as evidence, together with published biogeographic patterns, to consider updates to the ecosystem map. Updates to ecosystem components or types, such as newly mapped submarine canyons and kelp forests mapped from satellite data2 are being incorporated in the ecosystem map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 1. The Great African Sea Forest: Kelp forest ecosystem types of South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge brown seaweeds of the order Laminariales fringe rocky shores of temperate and high-latitude regions, creating kelp forest ecosystem types that cover over 30% of shallow rocky reefs globally. They are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and offer many social and economic benefits, including fishing, ecotourism, a variety of kelp-derived products, and play a role in fixing atmospheric carbon3. Evidence of consumption of species associated with kelp forests has been dated to about 70 000 years ago in South Africa. The extent of kelp forests has been documented to change, with expansion reported locally4 and cases of kelp loss documented internationally5.\nDunga et al. (2024) created the first comprehensive high-resolution map of canopy forming coastal kelp in South Africa, covering the spatial distribution of Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida and Macrocystis pyrifera2. This work highlighted the need for improved long-term monitoring to understand distributional changes and better mapping of subsurface kelp, particularly Ecklonia radiata, which has been recorded in deeper waters from trawl and remotely operated vehicle surveys on the eastern shelf of South Africa6,7. The kelp map enabled the classification and delineation of three kelp forest ecosystem types in South Africa, the Namaqua, Cape, and Agulhas kelp forests and supported their ecosystem threat status assessment using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Masters student, Ms. Nelisiwe Hambile, is embarking on work to map subsurface kelp forests in South Africa using remotely sensed data, and to assess how they will respond under different climate change scenarios. This work is a collaborative effort with the Seas of Good Hope, SANBI and the University of Cape Town and is funded by the Joan Wrench Kirstenbosch Scholarship Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated environmental layers have been organised by topical project groups, which include oceanography, geology and geomorphology. A suite of oceanographic (physical, chemical and phytoplankton) variables for surface and seafloor depths were downloaded from the Bio-ORACLE platform and calculated from Copernicus Marine Service satellite products and regional ocean model hindcasts provided by SAEON and SOMISANA. Updated sediment data were sourced from collaborators, greatly increasing the inventory of marine sediment sample and seafloor description records. Interpolated maps of sediment characteristics were additionally sourced from dbSEABED. Geomorphological variables included a new, national-scale, 100-m resolution bathymetry map9, from which derived variables such as slope angle, bathymetric position index and rugosity were calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBox 2. South Africa’s submarine canyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine canyons are steep-sided valleys that cut into the continental slope and play an important role in connecting coastal and deep-sea environments by facilitating the vertical movement of water, sediments, and nutrients. Many of these canyons host complex terrain, diverse substrate types, habitats and species, including vulnerable marine ecosystem indicators, such as cold-water corals and sponges. They act as important nursery and feeding grounds for a variety of benthic and pelagic species, some of which are conservation priorities, such as the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Furthermore, submarine canyons can act as refuges from anthropogenic pressures, such as trawling, in areas where steep slopes and complex terrain limit human access.\nDespite their ecological importance, many of South Africa’s submarine canyons have remained unknown and unmapped due to limited coverage of high-resolution bathymetry data. The release of the 2024 national-scale bathymetric map at 100-m resolution, combined with additional unpublished multibeam echosounder datasets, has enabled a substantial advance in the mapping of submarine canyon features in South Africa, increasing the number of canyon polygons from 39 in 2018 to over 120. This work, led by Nokubonga Mzimela, enhances knowledge on canyon classification and geomorphological processes, identifies shelf-breaching canyons that influence shelf ecology, supports habitat predictions for coelacanths and other species, and will improve the delineation of canyon ecosystem types in the next Marine Ecosystem Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. South Africa’s newly mapped submarine canyons (red outline) overlayed on the new bathymetry map9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant strides were also made in the collation of marine biodiversity records in a biodiversity occurrence database. Data were sourced from online data repositories, such as OBIS and GBIF and requested from a network of collaborators at a variety of government and tertiary research institutions. In October 2025, the database contained 1 310 081 records from 7 726 marine species and 12 data sources, representing a growing collection of biodiversity data in waters around South Africa. Although only a selection of marine survey datasets have been used in assemblage distribution models, the vision is to build a comprehensive biodiversity database that will enable presence-only modelling of biodiversity patterns and species turnover across broad taxonomic groups sourced from many datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneBox 3. Artificial intelligence and the Southern Africa Marine Biodiversity Reference Image Collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs underwater imaging technology becomes more accessible and widespread, the volume of visual data from marine surveys has outpaced capacity for manual annotations. This has created a need to improve para-taxonomic capacity and AI-powered solutions that can reliably and efficiently extract species occurrence and count data from underwater biodiversity surveys. In South Africa, YOLOv8 and BioCLIP2 models have been fine-tuned to identify marine fishes and invertebrates in Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) footage. These models rely on hierarchical taxonomic labels paired with curated images of species. More than 350 benthic invertebrate species across nine phyla have been indexed and catalogued in a standardised reference image database using the SMaTaR_ID framework. Pipelines have been developed for automating the detection of vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa in ROV videos, threatened seabreams of commercial importance in BRUVs and benthic epifauna for marine ecosystem classification and mapping. Ongoing work aims to expand the species included in the models through curation of high quality and diverse training datasets that underpin model accuracy.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of reproducible data and analytical pipelines marks a shift in ecosystem mapping methods, one that should improve efficiency, transparency and foster greater understanding and confidence in the resulting ecosystem map, which informs biodiversity management, spatial planning, and conservation efforts in South Africa. Further investment in data science will be needed to curate and integrate rapidly expanding data streams if South Africa is to maintain a robust evidence base to underpin improved ecosystem classification, mapping, assessment, planning, mainstreaming and decision-making.",

Note that the area estimates include both benthic and pelagic area beyond the shelf but do not include the subantarctic territory. Inshore and shelf ecosystem types are generally more threatened than those falling within the slope, abyss and open ocean regions. Ecosystem types of smaller extent and that are less widely distributed are at greater risk of extinction1. Overall, six ecosystem types (4% of types) are Critically Endangered, with 31 (19%) Endangered and 36 (22%) Vulnerable. Of the remaining ecosystem types, 19 (12%) and 71 (44%) were respectively, Near Threatened and Least Concern.\nThe locations of the threatened ecosystem types are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

The Agulhas Muddy Mid Shelf is threatened by demersal trawling that persists over much of the extent of this ecosystem type2 in addition to flow reduction. Similarly, the KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf has been modified by flow reduction and the demersal inshore crustacean inshore fishery that has subsequently ceased. The Browns Bank Rocky Shelf Edge has also been subject to intensive demersal trawling and high demersal longline effort leading to poor ecological condition. Both these ecosystem types were reported as Critically Endangered in 20183 under IUCN RLE Criterion C/D with four additional small ecosystem types listed under this category in 2025 when strictly applying IUCN RLE Criterion B.\nThe Orange Cone Inner Shelf Mud Reef Mosaic is impacted by ongoing flow reduction and marine mining. Cape Bay, which includes Table and Saldanha Bay, has very high cumulative pressures with ongoing degradation linked to port and harbour activities. The Aliwal Shoal Reef Complex falls entirely within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) but ongoing linefishing, waste water discharge and lethal shark control measures cause this ecosystem type, which is of restricted distribution, to be classified as Critically Endangered. Further work to support reef classification and measure ecosystem condition is recommended along with management to reduce pressures in the MPA.\n\n\n\nFauna including grunter, kobs and prawns from the Critically Endangered KwaZulu-Natal Bight Muddy Inner Shelf. © Kerry Sink\n\n\nThere are 31 Endangered ecosystem types (19%) which cover 0.9% extent of the marine realm area. Many of these are ecosystem types of limited extent that were uplisted (considered more threatened) relative to 2019 due to the application of global standards in 2025. For example, False and Walker Bay, St Helena Bay and Eastern Agulhas Bays (Algoa and St Francis) are all Endangered under either criterion B1 or B2 of the IUCN RLE.\n\n\n\nFalse and Walker Bay ecosystem type is now considered Endangered. © Peter Chadwick\n\n\nVulnerable ecosystem types cover 3.4% of the ocean space, with 36 ecosystem types (22%) falling within this category. All three kelp ecosystem types in South Africa are Vulnerable with cumulative fishing activities playing a key role in declining condition. Two of the 13 pelagic ecosystem types are threatened (South Atlantic Productive Margin Water and Upwelled Agulhas Current Margin Water), both of these being Vulnerable. Key pressures driving decline in condition include large pelagic fishing and mid water trawling. In 2025, all three coral communities were assessed as Vulnerable under the IUCN RLE criterion B3, with coral bleaching and associated ecosystem modification caused by climate change considered the key threat that could lead to ecosystem collapse. This also aligns with the IUCN RLE result for the Delagoa ecoregion in the regional assessments for the Western Indian Ocean4.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s three national coral community ecosystem types were assessed as Vulnerable in 2025 due their restricted distribution and the risk of climate change. These reef types are part of a regional ecosystem type. © Geoff Spiby\n\n\nNear Threatened (NT) ecosystem types are those that were evaluated to be within 10% of the threshold for Vulnerable. These ecosystems are at risk of ecosystem collapse if increasing pressures lead to further degradation in ecological condition. Examples include the Kingklip Koppies and the Agulhas Exposed Stromatolite Rocky Shore.\n\n\n\nThe Kingkilp Koppies is a Near Threatened ecosystem type off Gqeberha. A co-developed seabed management area will protect this ecosystem type from trawling but further collaborations are needed to secure this area from other activities that may impact the seabed.",

    "text": "Approach\nThe 2025 assessment of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was conducted using the 2024 Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria and drawing from previous NBA assessments. The threat status of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types was evaluated applying the IUCN Criteria A-D using pressure and condition maps from the 2018 assessment. Both the extent and severity of ecosystem degradation were considered by calculating the extent of ecosystem types in each of the four ecosystem condition categories. Condition assessments were based on an ecosystem pressure matrix that is used to weight the impact of each pressure on each ecosystem type.\nAs pressure and condition data sets were not updated for the 2025 assessment, it is important to note that changes in ecosystem threat status are largely as a result of refined methods rather than recent loss or degradation in marine ecosystems. New aspects that were considered in the 2025 assessment included Criterion A, habitat loss, and Criterion B, number of threat defined locations, ongoing drivers of ecological degradation (as opposed to pressures that have ceased) and stochastic events. Several ecosystem types have shifted into more threatened categories due to the ecosystem extent thresholds provided by the IUCN, but 13 ecosystem types had more positive (less threatened) results due to stricter thresholds for ongoing non-trivial decline in ecological condition.\nThe application of the IUCN global standards supported a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of previous deviations from the IUCN guidelines (such as altered thresholds under Criterion B in 2018) and provided a broader range of plausible results. It also led to the identification of new research priorities and recommendations relevant to current ecosystem mapping efforts and future ecosystem condition assessments that will strengthen assessments. See the ecosystem threat status and RLE explainer page for further information on South Africa’s approach to the assessment of ecosystem threat status.",

Several small, high-value ecosystem types are at risk of ecosystem collapse, which could compromise food, job and climate security (Key Message A2).\nOverall, coastal and shelf ecosystems are at higher risk of ecosystem collapse, and the most threatened ecosystem functional groups are bays, deepwater biogenic beds, muddy shelves and rocky ecosystems on the shelf. Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk (Key Message A2).\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 163 marine ecosystem types now have some representation in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, but only 20% are Well Protected (Key Message B4). Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves, and open oceans are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s marine protected area estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. Importantly, however, the ecological condition of marine ecosystems in MPAs also needs improvement (Key Message C2) for ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status. Ocean governance also needs to better consider and involve people in conservation initiatives (Key Message C1), diversify protection models, and address issues that undermine the legitimacy of conservation areas.\nIn the marine realm, 17% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected. These ecosystem types are found on the West Coast, the western Agulhas Bank shelf edge, parts of the Agulhas Bank and parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight (see intersection of marine threat status and protection level page).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Species assessments\nMarine species are assessed in terms of their stock status and/or threat status. Stock status refers to the resource status from a fisheries management perspective, whereas species threat status focuses on extinction risk using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria.\nThere is increasing knowledge on stock status of resources, with evidence of resource recovery for some species linked to improved fisheries and spatial management (Key Message A5). This shows that fish stocks can recover with effective collaborative management of effort, catch and area. However, some inshore resources are increasingly depleted, and abalone and west coast rock lobster are Endangered. Illegal fishing plays a key role in the poor status of these species (Key Message A6).\nOf the 506 marine species assessed using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria and thresholds, 36% are considered threatened (Key Message B1). However, this is an inflated estimate of the actual proportion of marine taxa that are threatened because species that are at risk and/or economically important have been prioritised for assessment, with few marine taxonomic groups being comprehensively assessed.\n\n\n\nSeveral marine invertebrate resources, seabreams and shark and rays were assessed as threated in 2025. West coast rocklobster are Endangered(© Geoff Spiby); dageraad are Critically Endangered (© Steve Benjamin); Bull sharks are Vulnerable (© Fiona Erst).\n\n\nSharks, rays and chimaeras are one of the most threatened groups across all realms. A re-assessment of South Africa’s seabreams showed improved threat status for three species while two have become more threatened. Of the 128 (may need update) South African shallow reef building corals assessed globally, 34% are threatened by climate change (Key Message A1).\nMarine species continue to have the highest levels of data deficiency across all realms, signalling the need to address knowledge gaps, improve monitoring (Key Message C3), and increase capacity for marine species red listing (Key Message C3). High levels of data deficiency compromise effective species and ecosystem management, spatial planning, and decision-making.",

    "text": "Pressures and ecological condition\n\n\nThere are many interacting pressures cumulatively affecting marine ecosystems and species. Key pressures impacting marine biodiversity include fishing (including industrial, recreational and illegal fisheries), coastal development (including ports and harbours), pollution, shipping, mining, freshwater flow reduction, lethal shark control measures and climate change.\nFishing, petroleum activities and shipping are widespread sectors resulting in many pressures on multiple ecosystem components and species. Fishing, particularly industrial fishing, continues to exert the greatest pressures on marine biodiversity (Key Message A5) impacting ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (Key Message B3).\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of 31 cumulative pressures in South Africa’s ocean. Red and orange areas have the highest cumulative pressure, with blue areas showing low pressure. White areas have no mapped pressures. Click to expand.\n\n\n\n\nHotspots of degradation and cumulative impacts are often driven by the location of ports and harbours, which increase access for fishing, alter shorelines and circulation, increase pollution, and facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive species. Pollution including industrial, municipal and noise pollution are key escalating pressures. Seismic surveys to detect potential offshore oil and gas resources have been expanding into deeper waters and, together with shipping and other sources of underwater noise, pose uncertain risks to marine ecosystems. Renewable energy production is important in achieving energy security and reducing climate change impacts but marine renewable energy development requires careful consideration of marine biodiversity impacts.\n\n\nThe first groundtruthing of marine ecosystem condition shows that pressure mapping is an effective proxy at broad national scales, but that finer scale pressure mapping can improve condition estimates. However, despite their importance in spatial planning, most marine pressure data are outdated, leading to missing pressures, poor resolution of some pressures, and inaccuracy of pressure impacts on ecosystem condition. Increased monitoring is needed to support assessment of ecosystem and species (Key Message B5), and to quantify ecological condition more accurately for both biodiversity assessment and guiding management.\nThe impacts of cumulative pressures also warrant consideration at multiple scales, particularly in evaluating the impacts of expanding and diversifying ocean economy activities. Failure to account for indirect and cumulative impacts will mean that important impacts are missed, resulting in poor spatial planning and decisions, with negative impacts on people and the environment (Key Message A2).\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of ecological condition showing the spatial distribution of marine areas in natural/near natural, moderately degraded, severely degraded or very severely degraded state.

The 2018 assessment also identified knowledge gaps and progress against these research priorities1 was briefly evaluated (Table / Box x). Persistent research priorities span foundational marine biodiversity research at the ecosystem, species and genetic level, to applied research for improving our understanding of the impacts of key pressures on ecological condition. New research priorities include the need for increased social science in the marine realm particularly to track progress in equitable protection (Ecosystem protection level).\n\n\n\nCitizen scientists have advanced the taxonomy and distribution records for nudibranchs and produced a beautiful publication that makes this information accessible. © Georgina Jones",

More than 70 individual actions were co-developed and these were classified into ten broad thematic areas of action with more detailed recommended steps and indicators for each action in order to track progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote1. Enable civil society participation in ocean planning, assessment, management and governance (Key messages C1 and B4).\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable participation in ocean planning, assessment and management to support a whole-of-society approach for effective ocean governance. This can be advanced through robust and inclusive stakeholder processes, strengthened capacity for social process across institutions and innovations in industry and community partnerships.\n\nEstablish a National Ocean People’s Forum through which government institutions can actively engage indigenous peoples, traditional leaders, traditional healers, small-scale fishers (including women and youth) and traditional knowledge holders on matters related to ocean planning and decision-making.\nIndigenous knowledge working group/s established and guideline developed to support the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in ocean assessment, planning and decision making.\nCo-develop a national small-scale fisheries priority areas map to represent the spatial interests of this vulnerable sector in national planning and decision making processes.\nEnsure that at least 50% of South Africa’s marine protected areas have established and active local MPA Fora.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone2.

Ensure South Africa has the skills and infrastructure to manage and deliver expanding data and knowledge products for informed ocean planning and decision-making (Key message A2?, Key message B5, and Key message C2).\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in data science capacity and infrastructure to ensure effective data pipelines that integrate and update strategic analyses in a transparent way to support informed ocean decision-making. Strengthened capacity and infrastructure is needed for all organisations tasked with mapping, assessing, monitoring, and providing indicators and data products that inform management of marine biodiversity, fisheries and the ocean.\n\nNew knowledge products are developed to support ocean decision making.\nData managers, data scientists and spatial analysts are part of the staff complement of organizations tasked with mapping, assessing, monitoring, and providing indicators and data products that inform management of marine biodiversity, fisheries and the ocean.\nResearchers and key staff are trained in relevant data science tools, data standards and reproducible workflows.\nOrganisational data infrastructure, IT policies and capacity are enabling for effective database storage, curation and data sharing.\nFAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and reproducible science workflows are prioritised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone8.

Persistent barriers to effective protection must be overcome and key lessons in this process should be applied in future expansion efforts.\nOrganisations tasked with design, implementation and management of marine protected and conserved areas and spatial fisheries management have capacity for social science research, social learning facilitation and community development.\nEnsure that all MPAs have clear and specific objectives that encompass both biodiversity conservation and socio-economic considerations, which will require retrospective reviews for MPAs with unclear purposes.\nA formal definition, common understanding, and practical framework for co-management in an MPA-specific context is co-developed.\nAt least one small-scale fishing zone is co-designed and implemented and explored for recognition as an OECM with leadership from small-scale fishers. This can provide protection to fishers’ tenure rights and livelihoods whilst safeguarding vulnerable fishers, marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.\nPilot sustainable innovative finance mechanism to support long-term comprehensive operational funding for MPAs and incentivise local stewardship by indigenous people, youth and local communities.\nCapacity for monitoring, surveillance and compliance in and around MPAs is improved through adequate funding, new partnerships and innovative technology.\nOffshore protection levels improve for slope ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone9. Maintain and increase marine biodiversity benefits through improved statistics, communication and knowledge sharing (Key message C1, Key message C2, Key message C3).\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversify and improve the communication of marine biodiversity data (values and benefits, risks, usage), and mainstream biodiversity into key production sectors (especially fisheries). This will enable better understanding of the value of marine biodiversity and its contribution to the economy.\n\nA new product is co-developed to make the case for the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries.\nCommunication efforts are underway to reduce the risk of marine invasives.\nMarine needs identified and communicated to Statistics South Africa to support data collection for new statistics that support effective communication of the value of marine biodiversity to the economy.\nFirst set of marine and coastal natural capital accounts published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExplainer: Natural capital accounting\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic growth is intrinsically linked to environmental benefits, and studies have shown that environmental degradation can have far reaching implications for economic activity and human health (Acheampong & Opoku, 2023). The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework (United Nations et al., 2014) was adopted in 2012 as the international standard for developing environmental economic accounts that organises and presents statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy.\nNatural Capital Accounting, developed under the SEEA Central Framework, is an approach to quantify the value of natural resources and ecosystem services to the wealth of a country by allowing for the inclusion of environmental assets and their associated ecosystem services provided to the economy (Costanza et al., 1997, 2011; Stebbings et al., 2021).\nThrough the application of NCA in the marine and coastal realm, the value and contribution of marine and coastal ecosystems can be communicated in direct terms that link to the current System of National Accounts, illustrating the linkages and dependencies that exist between existing and future economic activities. For example, by linking the results of the NBA to maps of marine and coastal Ecological Infrastructure, NCA accounts can be developed to valuate and communicate the benefits from functional biodiversity in the availability and delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigations, adaptation and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone10. Reduce climate risks to people and nature (Key message A1, Key message B4, Key message C1, and Key message C3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in the multiple opportunities for scaling up integrated climate action through inclusive choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice.\nCatalyse national monitoring and mapping of coastal climate stressors, including temperature anomalies, coastal acidification (pH), hypoxia, and erosion.\nInclude climate change data into ecosystem risk assessments.\nPromote conservation, rehabilitation, and protection of climate-buffering natural capital ecosystems, including both blue carbon vegetated habitats and biogenic carbonate systems (e.g., shellfish and coralline habitats).\nStrengthen environmental and energy policy implementation to support ecosystem-based and low-emission development pathways, including improved coordination of renewable energy transitions, plastic pollution reduction (aligned with the Global Plastics Treaty), and nature-based climate solutions.\nClimate Change Adaptation Response Plan for South Africa’s Coastal Sector (CARP; work underway).",

Continued wetland loss and declining ecological condition has led to significant ecological and financial loss. This deterioration is often gradual and ‘out of sight’ and, therefore, generally not perceived as an immediate threat. It is, however, a serious concern which should be addressed through restoration (where feasible and strategic) and improved, frequent, monitoring and reporting.\nEcological condition was calculated for 171 303 wetlands. Of these, approximately 1 476 561 ha (49%) of inland wetland extent and # (58%) of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in natural (class A) or near-natural (class B) ecological condition. Approximately 808 325 ha (27%) of inland wetland extent and # (x%) of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in a moderately modified (class C) ecological condition and approximately 705 797 (27%) of inland wetland extent and x% of inland wetland ecosystem types have been assessed to be in severely modified (class D, E or F) ecological condition.\nOf the different hydrogeomorphological types, depression wetlands are in the best ecological condition, with 14% of depression wetlands Severely Modified, 11% Moderately Modified and 76% in a Near-Natural or Natural ecological state. Floodplain, unchannelled valley-bottom, and seep wetlands all appear to have 42% Severely Modified wetland extent, with 34%, 35%, and 42% respectively in Near-Natural or Natural ecological condition. xxxxx [Need to re-run numbers]\nWetlands are complex systems that are influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors.

In addition to being typed according to Ollis et al. 2013, the method also requires xxx wetland to have a 200 m buffer, as well as have its area of influence mapped. While the 200 m buffer is created by the automated process, the area of influence was created using a separate, but also automated, process. This allows the area of influence to be the actual wetland catchment, instead of buffers as were used during the previous NBA assessment (Van Deventer et al. 2019).\nOverall wetland condition was calculated from the combined state of wetland hydrology, water quality, geomorphology, and vegetation, which were all calculated from the inferred pressures of different land cover classes (MacFarlane et al. 2020).\nThe systematic nature of the PES process allows for the development of a base dataset which can be augmented by expert data. xxx has been initiated through selected expert engagements with the National Wetland Map team, during which spatial extent, typing, and PES data were xxx for individual wetlands and wetland complexes.

Approximately 86% of inland wetland extent is Threatened, with 20% Critically Endangered, 21% Endangered, and 45% Vulnerable. The remaining 14% is Least Concern.\nAccording to inland wetland ecosystem type, 72% of wetland types are Threatened, with 15 (18%) of inland wetland ecosystem types Critically Endangered, 20 (24%) Endangered, and 25 (30%) Vulnerable.

However, to ensure the most robust and defensible characterisation of wetland types, the National Wetland Map team is actively refining the typology into more detailed, validated subtypes in collaboration with specialist researchers and other national wetland map supporters. Ongoing work means the National Wetland Map is currently improving at a rapid rate and this may result in minor adjustments and an updated ecosystem threat assessment in the near future. For this reason, and as conditions on the ground may have changed since mapping, it is important for consistency that the national ecosystem threat status be referred to but also essential for the data to be verified in the field by a wetland professional and desirable that updates or discrepancies be reported back to the National Wetland Map team.",

A wide range of climatic, geological and topographic settings have resulted in an exceptional diversity of wetland ecosystem types, from permanently saturated peatlands that accumulated in place over thousands of years to ephemeral salt pans harbouring newly described invertebrate species. In global terms, South Africa’s wetlands are small, with nearly 50% that are less than 1.5 hectares in size, but they are of outsized importance in a semi-arid context and they frequently function as an inter-connected network across a catchment. Wetlands provide vitally important benefits to people, such as improving water quality and controlling floods. They are water sources, habitats, and refuges for animals and people in times of drought.\nWe have an interim typology in place and are currently at work on an updated national system to understand and manage our wetlands as effectively as possible. The proposed updated typology update will contribute significantly towards ensuring their long-term health and the benefits they provide to all South Africans.",

From an ecosystem types perspective about 9% are Well protected, 36% Moderate, 41% Poorly, and 14% Not Protected.\nSince 2011 there has been erosion of protection in historical protected areas caused by removal of no-take restrictions and developing commercial fisheries in Marine protected Areas (MPAs). This is further exasperated by increased illegal gillnetting in protected areas in KZN.\nAn investment in estuarine protection is needed in ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected.

Estuarine ecosystem type protection level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through improved estuarine management and ecosystem restoration to reduce ecosystem degradation.\nSeveral under protected ecosystem types can advance to Well Protected solely with improved management of fishing and water quality. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi.\nThe global support for 30% protection target (2030 Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3) represent a unique opportunity to garden international support and present funding opportunities to advance estuary protection. Conservation agencies around the coast are in the process to evaluate and extend estuarine protection with local community support, e.g. Olifants Estuary and Verlorenvlei (CapeNature).\nOngoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats. It is less clear, if this mechanism will also be able to protect invertebrates, fish and birds. However, there is no doubt that increased community engagement in protection will create an environment of trust and present opportunities for strengthening protection over time, either as a ‘stepping stone’ for increase formal protection over time or as a sufficient measure one its own.",

Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) and/or Stewardship offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection. Lastly, increasing extent of protection alone will not advance estuarine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of ecosystems in protected areas needs improvement.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The extent of each ecosystem type within the network is expressed as a proportion of the total extent. Four categories of Ecosystem Protection Level are calculated per ecosystem type (n= 22).\n\nWell Protected: 100% of the PA target within PA network; AND only A&B condition estuaries contribute; AND areas under heavy and very heavy fishing pressure are excluded from contributing\nModerately Protected: 50% to 99% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nPoorly Protected: 5% to 49% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nNot Protected: less than 5% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\n\nThe PA target was historically set at 20% for marine and estuarine ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework - the protected areas target was increased to 30% in the EPL calculations (previous time points (2018) were recalculated using this higher target). Ecosystem condition data (van Niekerk et al., 2025) for each time point allow for only good condition estuaries without heavey fishing pressure (especially systems under severe gill-netting pressure) to be considered representative for Well Protected status; while for Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected and Not Protected the condition of the estuaries is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets such that higher integrity / condition estuaries contribute more to meeting protected areas targets than low integrity / condition estuaries.",

From an ecosystem types perspective about 9% are Well protected, 36% Moderate, 41% Poorly, and 14% Not Protected.\nSince 2011 there has been erosion of protection in historical protected areas caused by removal of no-take restrictions and developing commercial fisheries in Marine protected Areas (MPAs). This is further exasperated by increased illegal gillnetting in protected areas in KZN.\nAn investment in estuarine protection is needed in ecosystem types that are Not Protected or to advance Poorly Protected ecosystem types towards Well Protected. Ecosystem types in the Tropical and Warm Temperate biogeographical region are the best protected, while ecosystem types in the Cool Temperate are least protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "Opportunities to improve ecosystem protection level\n\nThere is an opportunity to improve the protection level of some of the Poorly or Moderately Protected ecosystem types to Well Protected through improved estuarine management and ecosystem restoration to reduce ecosystem degradation.\nSeveral under protected ecosystem types can advance to Well Protected solely with improved management of fishing and water quality. For example, 32% of types and 10% of area can be well protected if fishing effort in just 3 estuaries are better controlled – Langebaan, Knysna and Kosi.\nThe global support for 30% protection target (2030 Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3) represent a unique opportunity to garden international support and present funding opportunities to advance estuary protection. Conservation agencies around the coast are in the process to evaluate and extend estuarine protection with local community support, e.g. Olifants Estuary and Verlorenvlei (CapeNature).\nOngoing efforts to develop OECMs and stewardship approaches for estuaries present an opportunity for bottom-up conservation models to be developed that can be used to protect and arrest the ongoing decline in Blue Carbon habitats. It is less clear, if this mechanism will also be able to protect invertebrates, fish and birds. However, there is no doubt that increased community engagement in protection will create an environment of trust and present opportunities for strengthening protection over time, either as a ‘stepping stone’ for increase formal protection over time or as a sufficient measure one its own.\n\nFigureData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) and/or Stewardship offer new opportunities for a broader diversify of conservation models to contribute to marine protection. Lastly, increasing extent of protection alone will not advance estuarine ecosystems to well protected. The condition of ecosystems in protected areas needs improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

    "text": "Approach\nThe protection level assessment for estuarine ecosystems was adjusted to align with global targets. While the 2018 assessment used a standard 20% target, the 2025 assessment applied a 30% target. In order for a estuarine ecosystem type to qualify in the Well Protected category, at least 30% of the ecosystem type (i.e. the ecosystem target) needs to be in a natural / near natural ecological condition. If this target was not met, the ecosystem was categorised as Moderately Protected. Additionally, any area inside a protected area that was in degraded condition had it’s contribution to the protection level target scaled according to the severity of the degradation.\nUsing as input data the South African Protected Areas Database (SAPAD) 2024Q4 (Department of Forestry Fisheries and Environment), South African estuary ecosystem map (van Niekerk 2020) and estuarine health condition as input data.\nEstuarine Condition (Health) scores (0-100) are assigned to Department of Water and Sanitation Present Ecological Status (PES) categories (A-F) and NBA Modification categories (Natural - Severely modified) according to the table below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3. NEEDS A CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition score (0-100)\nPES category\nModification category\n\n\n\n\n&gt;= 90\nA\nNatural\n\n\n&gt;=75 & &lt; 90\nB\nNear Natural\n\n\n&gt;= 60 & &lt; 75\nC\nModerately Modified\n\n\n&gt;=40 & &lt; 60\nD\nHeavily Modified\n\n\n&lt; 40\nE/F\nSeverely/Critically Modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection Level is an indicator developed in South Africa that measures the representation of ecosystem types within the protected area network. The extent of each ecosystem type within the network is expressed as a proportion of the total extent. Four categories of Ecosystem Protection Level are calculated per ecosystem type (n= 22).\n\nWell Protected: 100% of the PA target within PA network; AND only A&B condition estuaries contribute; AND areas under heavy and very heavy fishing pressure are excluded from contributing\nModerately Protected: 50% to 99% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nPoorly Protected: 5% to 49% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\nNot Protected: less than 5% of PA target within the PA network; and A&B condition estuaries contribute 100%, C & D condition estuaries contribute 30% and E&F condition estuaries contribute 10%\n\nThe PA target was historically set at 20% for marine and estuarine ecosystems, but with the adoption of the 30% targets for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework - the protected areas target was increased to 30% in the EPL calculations (previous time points (2018) were recalculated using this higher target). Ecosystem condition data (van Niekerk et al., 2025) for each time point allow for only good condition estuaries without heavey fishing pressure (especially systems under severe gill-netting pressure) to be considered representative for Well Protected status; while for Moderately Protected, Poorly Protected and Not Protected the condition of the estuaries is used to calculate their contribution to meeting targets such that higher integrity / condition estuaries contribute more to meeting protected areas targets than low integrity / condition estuaries.",

Of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types, 59% are threatened with 23% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered and 18% Vulnerable. Of total estuarine area, 99% is threatened with 1% Critically Endangered, 57% Endangered and 41% Vulnerable.\nOverall, Cool Temperate and Subtropical ecosystems are at higher risk of ecosystem collapse, and the most threatened ecosystem functional groups are Estuarine bays, Estuarine lakes, Large fluvially dominated, Large temporarily closed, and Arid predominantly closed systems. Unless collaborative efforts are made to improve ecological condition in these functional groups, the vital ecosystem services and benefits they provide are at risk.\nMore than 80% of South Africa’s 22 estuarine ecosystem types now have some representation in the protected areas network, but only 1% are Well Protected (link to KMB4). Slopes, abyssal plains, muddy and rocky shelves, and open oceans are the most Poorly Protected ecosystem functional groups.\nIncreasing the extent of South Africa’s estuarine protected area estate will contribute to improving ecosystem protection levels. Importantly, however, the ecological condition of estuaries in protected areas also needs improvement (link to KMC2) for ecosystem types to advance to Well Protected status. Estuarine conservation also needs to better consider and involve people (link to KMC1), diversify protection models, and address issues that undermine legitimacy.\nIn the estuarine realm, 17% of ecosystem types are both highly threatened and under protected, prevalent on the Cool Temperate and KwaZulu-Natal.",

    "text": "Responses\nSouth Africa has a strong policy and legislative framework to protect and manage estuaries. Excellent progress has been made in the management of estuaries in water and land use/planning sector. DWS has determined the ecological water requirements of all estuaries, with 100% of these being subject to the “Classification” of freshwater resources. In addition, about 20% of estuaries have Estuary Management Plans in various stages of completion under the guidance of DFFE, provinces and conservation agencies. These noteworthy progresses since 2018 play a critical role in ensuring estuary health and the multiple benefits that society derives from them.\nThe above measures are proactive in that they set management objectives for estuarine resources on the strategic level through the engagement of society in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, there has been a deterioration in the management of extractive use in estuaries, with sand, mineral and diamond mining key concerns.\nThere is an urgent need to strengthen bilateral arrangements between sectors dealing with Environment, Water, Fishing & Mining to ensure optimum resource allocation. In many of the above sectors, management measures and processes, biodiversity requirements were not met, e.g. flow allocation to the Mlalazi Estuary in the Thukela MPA was not sufficient to prevent increased constricted/closed mouth conditions and associated poor water quality. Given that estuarine management straddles multiple sectors, a more robust intergovernmental engagement could assist in ensuring a balance in sectoral requirements and preventing mandate conflict between departments.\n\n\n\nKromme Estuary with extensive salt marsh. © Riaan Weitz.",

    "text": "Summary\nSouth Africa arguably has one of the most diverse and scenic coasts in the world, supporting a wealth of unique biodiversity. Altogether, there are 190 coastal ecosystem types that comprise the ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ). These include 83 vegetation types, 22 estuarine ecosystem types, and 85 marine ecosystem types. Freshwater ecosystem types are not currently included in the EDCZ, but there is planned inclusion in future.\n\n\n\nThe ecological determined coastal zone is a cross-realm zone that includes terrestrial, estuarine and marine ecosystem types, as illustrated here at Nature’s Valley.

    "text": "Defining and delineating the ecologically determined coastal zone\nUnlike the terrestrial, inland aquatic, estuarine and marine assessments, all of which assess ecosystem types per realm, the coast assessment is undertaken in a cross-realm zone. The reason for focusing on the coast specifically is because the majority of the world’s population lives in this zone1, concentrating pressures on biodiversity. Unless assessed separately, trends in coastal biodiversity relative to the rest of the land and sea are lost in the individual realm assessments.\nThere are lots of different definitions and boundaries of coastal zones. For purposes like biodiversity assessments, the extent of the coast needs to comprise whole ecosystem types because that is the unit of assessment. Using whole ecosystem types also means that the results from the separate realm assessments can be extracted and summarized for the coast.\nSubstantial effort went into delineating an ecologically determined coastal zone (EDCZ) for the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018 by seamlessly aligning the separate realm ecosystem maps, and tagging relevant ecosystem types in the terrestrial, estuarine and marine realm as ‘coastal’ based on a set of criteria2. The premise underpinning these criteria is that ecosystem types are considered coastal if they have a direct influence from both the land and sea:\n\nTerrestrial ecosystem types: all vegetation types influenced by the sea, including:\n\nCoastal Vegetation – vegetation types with purely coastal descriptions, and/or with&gt;95% of their extent within 2.5 km of the seashore\nSemi-Coastal Vegetation – vegetation types with coastal affinities mentioned in description, and/or with&gt;70% of their extent within 10 km of the seashore\n\nEstuarine ecosystem types: all estuary and micro-estuary types are included in the EDCZ\nMarine ecosystem types: all marine ecosystem types influenced by land are coastal, including:\n\nAll ecosystem types between the shore and the fair-weather wave base (depth at which ocean waves start to interact with the sea floor)\nAll river-influenced marine ecosystem types\n\n\nThis criteria-based approach means that as ecosystem maps update per realm, the changes are incorporated in updates of the EDCZ.",

    "text": "South Africa’s coastal ecosystem types\nThe cool Benguela and warm Agulhas currents that flow around South Africa drive steep gradients in climate and environmental conditions from west to east, resulting in diverse coastal ecosystem types and associated species, many of which are found no where else on earth3. The west coast is cool and arid, and the east coast is warm and wet, with a moderate south coast between them. The biogeography around the South African coast thus ranges from cool temperate in the west, through warm temperate in the south, to subtopical and tropical in the east.\nThe EDCZ has been updated for the NBA 2025 based on updates to the respective realm maps, and currently comprises 190 ecosystem types3 (Figure 1):\n\n83 vegetation types: dunes and seashore vegetation, strandveld, duneveld, dune thicket, and coastal thicket, forests and fynbos\n22 estuary ecosystem types: predominantly open, temporarily closed, and fluvially dominated estuaries, and estuarine lakes, bays and lagoon\n85 marine ecosystem types: sandy beaches, shingle shores and boulder shores, mixed shores, rocky shores, microbialites, islands, reefs, kelp forests, bays, hard and soft inner shelf, and river-influenced ecosystem types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. South Africa’s ecologically determined coastal zone comprises 190 ecosystem types from the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realms that all support a rich diversity of species, many of which are endemic to South Africa.\n\n\n\nTechnically, there are an additional three microestuary ecosystem types that are also included in the EDCZ3. However, because microestuaries are not assessed in the National Biodiversity Assessments, they are excluded from the count of coastal ecosystem types in the NBA 2025 content to simplify the statistics and reporting.\nAlthough there is not yet enough information to systematically identify inland aquatic ecosystem types as coastal and non-coastal, this is an area of work that needs more research. There is planned inclusion of freshwater types in future (e.g., freshwater forested wetlands, dune slacks, groundwater, aquifers, seeps and springs, and river–estuary transition zones).\nThe coastal ecosystem types are listed below (Table 1). For a descriptive overview of these ecosystem types, and inland aquatic ecosystem types proposed to be included in future, refer to the publication.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The coastal pressures in South Africa are summarised cross-realm under 10 themes: (1) biological resource use; (2) energy production and mining; (3) pollution; (4) coastal development; (5) transportation and service corridors; (6) natural systems modifications; (7) human intrusions and disturbance; (8) aquaculture, agriculture and plantation forestry; (9) invasive and other problematic species and diseases; and (10) climate change, severe weather, and ocean acidification. The impact of these pressures on coastal ecosystem types is analysed using realm-specific methods to generate a map of coastal ecological condition. Overall, the coast is in worse ecological condition than the rest of the country (non-coastal land and sea).\n\n\n\nPressures, such as mining, are intense in the coastal zone, causing declines in the ecological condition of coastal ecosystem types and increasing species extinction risk.

As a result, human population densities are much higher closer to the shore than further inland. In fact, there are more people living within 50 km of the shore today as lived on Earth in the 1930s1. This means that the human footprint is generally much higher in the coastal zone than elsewhere.\nThe distinct geographic position of the coast at the interface between land and sea also means that it is exposed to multiple pressures from land-based, estuarine, and marine sources. In fact, of all pressures to biodiversity mapped in the terrestrial, estuarine, and marine realm assessments, only four pressures are absent from the coastal zone (all of which are types of deep-sea fishing).",

    "text": "Pressures on coastal ecosystem types\nThe pressures on coastal biodiversity are briefly summarized below under the 10 categories established by the IUCN (Figure 1), with some slight terminology adjustments. Click the headings to view or hide the information per pressure category.\n\n\n1. Biological resource use\n\n\n There are many forms of biological resource use in the coastal zone, with different levels of sustainability and impact to coastal biodiversity. Photo credit: © Ryan Daly\n\nSouth Africa’s coast is rich in biological resources on land, in estuaries and in the sea that are harvested for food, medicine, symbolism, and materials. Resources such as invertebrates, fish, birds, mammals, seaweeds, and plants are collected both legally and illegally, with key concerns regarding over-harvesting, bycatch, and ghost fishing. Unsustainable resource use impacts populations of target and non-target species and their respective predators, causes changes in trophic and demographic structures of foodwebs, alters energy flow through and among ecosystems, and some collection methods cause habitat damage. Certain species are particularly impacted by poaching, e.g., abalone and succulent plants.\n\n\n\n2. Energy production and mining\n\n\nMining is a key pressure on coastal biodiversity, particularly the serial mining along the west coast. © Linda Harris\n\nSouth Africa’s mineral wealth is comparable to its outstanding biodiversity, and mining is a key economic activity in the country. In the coastal zone, sand, diamonds, and heavy minerals are mined in legal and illegal operations. Mining is an intense pressure on biodiversity with long-term impacts from habitat fragmentation and loss, and species disturbance and extirpations. It can also cause pollution, proliferation of alien and invasive species, and changes in habitat characteristics that have knock-on effects to species.\nImpacts to coastal biodiversity in South Africa from petroleum exploration and production are primarily in the marine realm, with increasing interest in offshore operations as part of national imperatives to grow the country’s blue economy. Petroleum activities can cause habitat loss, introduction of alien and invasive species, and various forms of pollution - including oil spills - that collectively cause habitat degradation; impact species communication, feeding, distributions and migrations; and increase the likelihood of ship-strikes to marine animals.\nRenewable energy is important for achieving energy security, reducing climate change impacts, and supporting socio-economic growth in the country. Current operations in South Africa’s coastal zone include wind farms, with planned solar energy plants and green fuel (green hydrogen and green ammonia initiatives), and potential offshore wind farms. Impacts to biodiversity include habitat fragmentation and loss, species disturbance, collisions with wind turbines, and extirpations, as well as potential pollution.\n\n\n\n3. Pollution\n\n\nPollution from plastics, wastewater, artificial light at night, noise, and obsolete ammunition are degrading the ecological condition of coastal ecosystems. Photo credit: © Fiona MacKay\n\nPlastic pollution is present all along South Africa’s coastal zone, with substantial quantities washing into the coastal zone during flood events. The impact of plastics on biodiversity, especially coastal and marine biodiversity, has become very apparent in recent years and there are numerous campaigns globally to stop single-use plastics in particular, and to reduce use of plastics generally. Key concerns include: animal entanglement, which can lead to injury, suffocation or drowning; ingestion causing gut blockages; accumulation of chemicals derived from plastic ingestion in animal tissue; and potential increases in spread of alien and invasive species.\nLand-based wastewater discharge is a significant source of chemical pollution and comprises a range of effluents and polluted runoff. Wastewater enters the sea via estuaries and outfalls, polluting ground- and surface water and sediments. Areas with high levels of organic nutrients cause eutrophication, fuel red tides and harmful algal blooms, and can cause anoxia, which may lead to fish kills. There is increasing concern over the quantities of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals and hydrocarbons recorded in the coastal zone that can accumulate in foodwebs, with risks to human health.\nArtificial light at night makes naturally dark areas lighter, altering natural cycles of light and dark, and impacting species’ circadian rhythms and night-time behaviour. Impacts to coastal species have been recorded in rocky shore communities, dune vertebrates, plants, pollinators, sea turtles, and intertidal fish, and it is one of the key pressures impacting threatened beach invertebrates, e.g., the Endangered Cape pillbug, Tylos capensis.\nSound travels more readily through water, making noise pollution a particular concern in aquatic environments, especially as oceans become busier and noisier. Noise can cause direct mortality, impaired hearing, and lower immunity and increased health risks of species. It also disrupts animal communication and social behaviour, limits bird-call repertoires, impacts animal foraging behaviour and success, and alters species distributions as they avoid noisier areas.\nDisposing ammunition, such as artillery shells, and expired, unusable or obselete ammunition, at sea was practiced in South Africa from the 1970s until 1995. There are several concerns for marine biodiversity: corrosion of munitions and resulting pollution and toxicity (especially from heavy metals like lead and mercury) in the surrounding environment; potential detonation, causing localised destruction; and changes to the physical environment and potential damage or smothering of natural ecosystems due to presence of foreign structures and/or damage to habitat-forming species.\n\n\n\n4. Coastal development\n\n\nCoastal development is a significant pressure on coastal biodiversity, causing habitat fragmentation and loss. © Linda Harris\n\nCoastal development is one of the most important pressures on coastal biodiversity because it causes largely irreversible habitat fragmentation and loss, with associated impacts to species distributions and population abundance, increasing extinction risk. Ecosystems are degraded further when ecological processes are disrupted, and ecological infrastructure and ecological resilience are compromised, in turn reducing ecosytem services and benefits to people. When infrastructure is built too close to the shore, beaches are at risk of complete inundation and loss as sea levels rise, with no option for them to naturally realign further inland. Broadly speaking, the areas in South Africa associated with ports and harbours are most intensively developed.\n\n\n\n5. Transportation and service corridors\n\n\nPorts and harbours are sources of multiple pressures on coastal ecosystems, and transport corridors disrupt cross-realm connectivity and ecological processes. Photo credit: © Riaan Weitz\n\nPorts and harbours are hubs of activity, development, and access to the sea. The impacts to biodiversity from associated activities include being hotspots of pollution, and high-risk entry points and refugia for alien and invasive species, with local habitat modification and degradation from anchorage, maintenance dredging and dredge spoil dumping. Offshore bunkering (ship-to-ship transfer of fuel) can have deleterious impacts to marine life, especially threatened colonial seabirds, e.g., African Penguins and Cape Gannets.\nSouth Africa is a hub of shipping activity, with eight commercial ports that receive international trade. The main biodiversity impacts associated with shipping are: impacts from oil spills during shipping accidents; underwater noise; ship strikes with large marine animals; introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water discharge and hull fouling; and various forms of pollution, including when ships lose their cargo at sea.\nMany roads and railway lines that run along South Africa’s coastline break connectivity of ecological processes across the land-sea interface, and in some places, are very precariously positioned and are at risk of damage and collapse in the face of heavy swell and floods. Roads and railway lines also run over estuaries on bridges, which changes sediment flow downstream, and can cause mouth closure and lead to eutrophication. Connectivity of terrestrial species through their distributions is also impacts by linear infrastructure, with many species being injured or killed by moving vehicles.\n\n\n\n6. Natural systems modifications\n\n\nAltering natural flows of freshwater and sediments, e.g., the weir in the uThukela River, impacts estuarine systems and downstream beaches and marine mud belts. © Fiona MacKay\n\nInterruption of sand-flow processes impacts sand budgets that maintain beaches and dunes. Sand is transported to and along the coast by rivers and estuaries, wind (including through wind-driven mobile dunefields), and by waves and inshore currents. The dune-beach-surf zone within which sand moves is called the littoral active zone, where erosion (sand removal) and accretion (sand build up) are natural processes. Blocking these flows by stabilising sand dunes, replacing foredunes with coastal development, and contructing dams and weirs in estuaries reduces the amount of sand available to beaches and dunes, decreasing their resilience to large storms and sea-level rise.\nHealthy functioning rivers deliver freshwater, nutrients and sediments to estuaries and the ocean, and sand to beaches and dunes. Hydrological regime change and freshwater flow reduction in estuaries from water abstraction, large impoundments and small farm dams impacts both estuarine ecosystems and downstream marine ecosystems. Without sufficient flow, water quality declines, salinity regimes are compromised, and sediment accumulates in estuary mouths, often increasing the risk of coastal flooding. Estuarine connectivity, and fish nursery functions are also compromised, with knock-on effects for marine fisheries. Trapping sediment in catchments also cuts off sand and mud supplies to downstream beaches and marine mud belts, respectively. Artificial breaching also alters natural hydrological regimes in estuaries, and can have potentially cascading impacts on the physico-chemistry of the estuary and its biological components.\nAlthough coastal rangelands are generally a biodiversity-compatible land use, under some circumstances they can pose risks to coastal ecosystems. Livestock grazing and browsing and associated trampling can contribute to dune destabilisation, and to increased susceptibility to erosion of dunes and estuarine banks. Livestock grazing and browsing can also stunt the growth of mangrove trees and reduce biomass of salt marsh, reducing blue carbon in estuarine systems.\n\n\n\n7. Human intrusions and disturbance\n\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities in the seashore zone that cause erosion and lethal and non-lethal impacts to species. © Linda Harris\n\nCoastal disturbance includes various forms of non-extractive human activities, such as trampling, off-road vehicle (ORV) driving, in-water recreation, and boating in estuaries and the sea. Biota can get crushed, injured, or disturbed, and shorebirds can be disturbed during breeding and foraging. Trampling in dunes also risks erosion and formation of blowouts. Virtually the entire South African shoreline is accessible by foot, and is thus potentially vulnerable to human disturbance in some form.\n\n\n\n8. Aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry\n\n\nThere is disproportionately more aquaculture, agriculture, and plantation forestry in the coastal zone than in the rest of the land and sea, causing a variety of impacts to coastal biodiversity. © Daniel Lemley\n\nAlong the South African coast, mariculture operations take the form of in-situ aquatic operations using long-lines, rafts, racks or cages, and land-based aquaculture operations abstract sea water, pass it through a culture facility, and then return it to the marine environment. One of the main biodiversity concerns associated with aquaculture is introduction of alien and potentially invasive species to the natural environment. Other concerns include transfer of disease and pathogens to local populations; potential for emergence of superbugs due to the use of antibiotics; genetic exchange between farmed and wild populations; and changed behaviour of apex predators around installations.\nAgricultural practices vary in terms of their impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Cultivation of croplands requires clearing natural habitats, resulting in habitat loss, and contaminated agricultural return flow can pollute estuarine and marine systems, causing eutrophication. Abandoned croplands may be impacted further by unsustainable livestock grazing and alien invasive species in fallow areas.\nCommercial afforestation threatens a host of coastal species through fragmentation and loss of indigenous vegetation. The concentration of a large numbers of trees can also change the local hydrology, lowering the water table and impacting streams, wetlands and indigenous plants. Plantation canopies cause shading, soil acidification and aridification, and can alter understory growth and nutrient availability to indigenous biota.\n\n\n\n9. Invasive and other problematic species and diseases\n\n\nIndigenous species are being impacted by invasive alien species, e.g., deliberately introduced species to stabilise dunes, and unintentionally introduced species from shipping, and other problematic species and diseases. © Linda Harris\n\nInvasive alien species are an established pressure on land, but an emerging pressure in estuaries and the sea. Many of the terrestrial invasive alien species in coastal areas are present because of deliberate introductions, e.g., to stabilize mobile dunes at a time when this was considered to be best practice. In contrast, introduction of invasive alien species to the estuarine and marine realms has been generally unintentional, e.g. through hull fouling and ballast water. Invasive alien species can change community composition and local ecological processes, with direct and indirect effects on indigenous species. Invasive alien species can also contribute to wildfires and alter natural fire regimes, reduce mean annual runoff, and can reduce light, oxygen and flow in estuaries, with knock-on affects to biodiversity.\nThe frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in South Africa’s coastal zone, largely due to increased nutrient loading from municipal wastewater, urban stormwater, and agricultural runoff. HABs impact estuarine and coastal marine systems by causing hypoxia, impacting biodiversity and causing mass mortalities, with potential risks to human health as well.\nSeveral other pathogens and diseases are impacting coastal species, including High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza in seabirds, rabies in seals, and a water mold (Aphanomyces invadans) that causes epizootic ulcerative syndrome in fish that is now found in almost all estuaries in South Africa.\n\n\n\n10. Climate change, severe weather, and ocean acidification\n\n\nClimate change is predicted to impact coastal ecosystems and species in a variety of ways, such as marine heatwaves causing coral bleaching. © Kerry Sink\n\nWhere coasts are unconstrained, sea-level rise does not pose a risk to coastal biodiversity because the shore will naturally realign further inland. However, where the coast has been built up with development within the littoral active zone, particularly where it is defended with seawalls, the consequence is that the shores are trapped in a coastal squeeze, with long-term risks of infrastructure failure as well. Supralittoral and high shore species are most at risk of loss, including loss of nesting and foraging habitat for shorebirds. Sea-level rise will affect saline penetration and mouth state in estuaries, altering estuarine ecology, and mangroves and salt marsh habitats may be impacted too.\nClimate-change predictions for South Africa include altered rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme events, such as droughts, storms and floods. The South African east coast is predicted to get wetter, particularly from heavy rainfall events and floods, and the west coast is predicted to get drier, where recent droughts attributed to climate change have increased the extinction risk to endemic plants. Increased storminess increases coastal erosion, and can impact estuarine ecology. Although coastal ecosystems are generally able to return to pre-storm conditions, this is dependent on the frequency of events.\nCoastal species are shiting their ranges in response to temperature change. This could lead to various changes in communities as biological interactions change, and pioneer species may trigger ecological successions. Coastal endemic species along the south coast may also experience a temperature squeeze between the Cool Temperate and Subtropical bioregions. Other impacts include increased likelihood and spread of wildfires, dried up water holes, and altered animal behaviour.\nExtreme temperatures may have more significant impacts than overall trends in warming and cooling. Heatwaves can cause mortality in indigenous plants and favour spead of invasives, and marine heatwaves can cause coral bleaching. Thermal shock to fish and invertebrates in the marine environment may be exacerbated when marine heatwaves are followed by upwelling events, causing washouts and mortalities.\nSouth African waters are more susceptible to impacts from ocean acidification because of the biochemistry of upwelled water, making systems like the Benguela naturally more acidic (lower pH). However, macroalgal habitats are less acidic (higher pH) than their surrounding environment, and may act as refugia for coastal species. Ocean pH levels are variable around South Africa in both space and time. Natural fluctuations in ocean acidity may either help create resilience in coastal species, or combine with gradual trends to produce more extreme conditions and impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of each of these pressures, refer to the published review on cross-realm pressures on coastal biodiversity in South Africa.",

    "text": "Ecological condition of coastal ecosystem types\n\nMapping ecological condition essentially gives a spatial representation of the overall effect of various pressures on biodiversity, and is one of the input datasets for calculating ecosystem threat status. Ecological condition is estimated using different approaches in the separate realms: in the terrestrial assessment it relies primarily on land-cover change; in the estuarine assessment, a multi-criteria framework is used; and in the marine assessment, cumulative pressure mapping is used. For details on the realm-specific methods, see the Ecological condition across realms section of the integrated findings and the individual realm pages on ecological condition (terrestrial, estuaries, marine).\nAlthough different methods for calculating ecological condition were used in the separate realm assessments, they were aligned as far as possible to allow for cross-realm comparisons and unified terminology. Ultimately, these are presented in the coastal assessment in four  simplified categories (that link to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories): natural/near-natural; moderately modified; heavily modified; and critically modified. Importantly, severely modified habitat is included differently among realms. For terrestrial and marine habitat, severely modified areas are included with heavily modified, and for estuarine habitat, severely modified areas are included with critically modified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Categories of ecological condition, summarised across realms. \n\n\n\nThe ecological condition of all coastal ecosystem types was extracted from the three realms and compiled into a single map, revealing that half (48%) of the South African coast is in a modified state, and a quarter (26%) is severely/critically modified (Figure 4, Figure 5). There is also more than double the amount of natural habitat that has been modified in the coastal zone than in non-coastal areas (Figure 5). Broadly speaking, the places with the highest population density are associated with coastal areas in the most heavily to critically modified ecological condition. These include the southwestern Cape, southeastern Cape, and most of KwaZulu-Natal. Importantly, these areas are all associated with ports and harbours, and their related burgeoning development in the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

There is evidence of population declines by 50-80% based on commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in South Africa over the past 10 years, disappearance of the species at sites that have been mined in Namibia, and anecdotal evidence of severe declines and/or disappearance of the species at certain beaches in South Africa. Harmful algal blooms can also cause mass mortalities. The overall population is suspected to have declined by over 50% in the past decade and it is therefore assessed as Endangered under Criterion A2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nTylos capensis (Cape calloused beach pillbug) is endemic to South Africa. It has a limited range and restricted habitat along the South African south coast, with between 9 and 12 locations extant. It is experiencing ongoing loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat to expanding coastal development and artificial light at night (ALAN), and has been lost from at least four locations, including inside protected areas. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nTylos granulatus (granulated calloused beach pillbug) is restricted to the coast of Namibia and South Africa. It generally occurs in low numbers, and is found in large abundances (hundreds to thousands of individuals) in only a few places. Extirpations have been recorded at the southern end of its range due to coastal development, there are no recent records in the northern part of its range, and it is impacted by mining. Kelp wrack removal takes away an important source of food for this species. Collectively these pressures are causing notable declines in its habitat availability and quality, and declines in the number of mature individuals. This species broods its young, has small broods and limited connectivity, and has been assessed as being severely fragmented based on the IUCN definition. It therefore qualifies as Endangered under Criterion B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis© Linda Harris (CC-BY-NC-ND)\n\n\n\n\nAcanthoscelis ruficornis (beach ground beetle) is a southern African endemic species, found only in the supralittoral habitat on sandy beaches along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. It burrows in the sand or hides under kelp wrack, feeding on invertebrates associated with wrack. Approximately 80% of its recent (since 2000) range is exposed to mining, coastal development and/or kelp wrack removal. These pressures are causing declines in habitat extent, quality, and population abundance, and there is evidence that the species has been lost from some sites that have been mined. The population is inferred to be severely fragmented, comprising small, isolated subpopulations across its range. It is therefore listed as Endangered under Criterion B.",

    "text": "What are Biodiversity Biobanks?\nBiodiversity biobanks, genetic resource banks, genetic repositories or genebanks can be described as scientific collections of different types of preserved biomaterials from biological organisms including tissue, DNA, blood, cell cultures, embryos, reproductive material such as seeds, eggs and sperm, and even whole organisms. These collections are usually preserved by freezing or cold storage. Environmental samples such as water or soil are increasingly being collected and stored for analyses of the biological communities in these habitats. For any type of biobank, one of the main qualifying criteria is that the biomaterials and associated data must be preserved and managed according to rigorous scientific standards and protocols to ensure the viability and quality of the material.\nExtant and even recently extinct species across the entire tree of life can be represented in biodiversity biobanks, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protists, as well as plants and animals but materials originating from humans are usually excluded. Biodiversity biobanks can include not only indigenous, naturally occurring species, but also exotic species, and in the context of agrobiodiversity, also breeds and varieties of cultivated crops and domesticated livestock.\nBiodiversity biobanks are recognised as essential infrastructure that preserves, manages and provides biomaterials representing currently and potentially endangered, useful, and harmful organisms, for research, conservation, sustainable use and biotechnology development. Biodiversity biobanks offer valuable materials that enable comparisons across taxa, regions and time, and they help to preserve biological material from species, populations, or strains that are rare, declining, or even extinct in the wild. Recent breakthroughs in DNA and RNA sequencing such as High Throughput Sequencing, alongside innovations like DNA barcoding, metabarcoding, whole genome sequencing and metagenomics, have significantly boosted interest in accessing genetic material. If powerful tools like gene editing, cell cloning, and ex situ propagation and reproduction are also considered, it is clear why there is an increase in the demand for access to genetic material. Vouchering of biomaterials from research projects in a recognized biobank allows both verification of data and further investigation.\n\n\n\nCuration of biomaterials.",

    "text": "Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa\nThe Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa (BBSA) is a network of biobanks that make biomaterials accessible to external researchers, and that agree to work towards the implementation of common, best practice standards and policies and is coordinated by SANBI. The BBSA is funded through the Department of Science, Technology & Innovation (DSTI) but the participating institutions are responsible for funding the routine operations of the biobanks. The aim of the BBSA is to increase the range and quality of biomaterials stored and/or distributed, and increase and improve access for research, conservation and socio-economic development. The objectives include promoting the value of biodiversity biobanks; ensuring a credible, legally compliant and ethical system for collecting, storing and providing access to biomaterials by aligning with standards and procedures set by global and national initiatives and structures; strategic expansion of the biobank holdings; increasing the use and impact of the biomaterials by making inventory data accessible; facilitating training and capacity development, and participation in international networks.\nThere are currently nine institutions (four national science councils, two institutions under a national government department and three universities) participating in the BBSA, collectively with 17 biobanks predominantly focused on indigenous biodiversity and 12 biobanks for crops and livestock and their diseases. These biobanks hold a total of over two million accessions. There are several other biodiversity biobanks in South Africa that are not involved in the BBSA and that are associated with individual researchers or units, and there are likely to be vast amounts of biomaterials that have been collected for research projects that are not accessioned into a biobank collection. There is also a substantial quantity of biomaterials originating in South Africa that are held in international biobanks.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Where are the gaps in South Africa’s Biodiversity Biobanks?\nThe three most obvious gaps in South Africa’s biodiversity biobanks are indigenous plant DNA, invertebrates and environmental samples suitable for eDNA (metabarcoding, metagenomic) analysis. SAIAB, ARC and SANBI have started collecting some eDNA samples, the Plant DNA Biobank at SANBI has been initiated, the ARC has started collecting some terrestrial invertebrate samples and SAIAB has a number of aquatic invertebrates represented in their biobank. A concerted, strategic effort will be required to ensure that these new biobanks (both infrastructure and holdings) expand at the rate required to allow them to be fully functional within a reasonable timeframe. A full analysis of the sample inventory across biodiversity biobanks is required to assess taxonomic, geographic, temporal and sample type coverage and to use these data to develop a detailed gap analysis to inform an expansion strategy to ensure that the biobanks fully represent South Africa’s biodiversity.",

    "text": "Access to biomaterials for research and development\nIncreasing demand for biobank materials for research purposes is a trend that has been recognized globally, especially for those institutions that have discoverable sample data. This is a positive trend in that it justifies the existence of the biobank, and facilitates research that benefits biodiversity, human health and economic development. Demand must be managed through sound policies that guide decision-making for the use of samples, and recognize that there can be different categories of use depending on the sample status (threat status of species, number of replicates, embargo for current projects) and categories of users and of types of use.\nThe Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization is an international agreement adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The Nagoya Protocol requires that the relevant authority in a signatory country must give Prior Informed Consent (PIC) before genetic resources can be accessed and used, that there is a Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) agreement between the provider country and the users on the conditions of access and use of the resources and on the benefits to be shared by the two parties. Benefits can be both monetary and non-monetary, with the latter including joint research, training, and sharing of results. At a national level, the Bioprospeing, Access and Benefit Sharing Regulations (2008, amended in 2015)[@governmentofsouthafrica2015] are relevant for bioprospecting and biotrade but also the collection of samples that may have any use for type of biodiscovery or bioprospecting even if this is in future, and the export of samples from South Africa including for purely academic research. There is also legislation for Threatened and Protected Species, provincial legislation for collecting, sharing and exporting biomaterials and requirements for research involving biomaterials originating from animals or micro-organisms under the Animal Disease Control Act (1984). Microbial culture collections need to be registered with the Department of Trade and Industry in terms of the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, 1993 (Act no 87 of 1993). This is a complex regulatory environment that places a significant burden on researchers and on biodiversity biobanks.",

Ensuring that the biodiversity biobanks contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of South Africa’s biodiversity will require that they are valued as national assets that need sustained investment, but also that those responsible for them are aware of global and national pressures as well as trends in data management and access, meeting standards for sample management, expanding not only the inventory of samples but also the user base and actively participating and contributing to international and national networks.",

    "text": "South African Barcode of Life (SABOL)\nThe South African Barcode of Life (SABOL) is the national node of the International Barcode of Life Consortium (iBOL). SABOL is funded by the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSI) through the Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP). SABOL promotes DNA barcoding research, addressing gaps in species reference libraries, and supports the NBA by consolidating scattered biodiversity data into one comprehensive national resource. DNA barcoding strengthens biodiversity assessments, particularly for cryptic and understudied taxa.\nBetween 2013 and 2022, the FBIP funded 124 DNA barcoding-related projects totaling over R60 million (Figure 1). These efforts align with both international and national obligations, including the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the South Africa’s National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Funds (in millions of South African Rands) awarded per year to biodiversity research through the Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP) between 2013 and 2022. Plot adapted from Mahlatse et al. under review.\n\n\n\nA key component of DNA barcoding is the availability of a comprehensive reference library of expertly identified specimens. The Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) serves as a trusted repository for these sequences, ensuring that barcodes meet rigorous quality standards and are derived from taxonomically verified specimens. By providing a reliable foundation for species identification, BOLD underpins SABOL and other national barcoding initiatives, enabling accurate biodiversity assessments and monitoring.",

    "text": "South African barcoding efforts to date\nOver the past decade, South Africa has made significant progress in expanding its faunal DNA barcoding database, particularly for insects and other invertebrates. An early review of DNA barcoding reported that South Africa had contributed approximately 48,000 faunal DNA barcodes to BOLD, representing approximately 2.3% of all known species globally, at the time of this review15.\nSince 2016, contributions to the reference library have grown substantially, with numerous South African researchers and institutions submitting data on indigenous species. As of 28 October 2025, BOLD contains 786,480 sequences (multiple gene sequences for some records), representing 776,512 specimens from South African localities. Approximately, 93% (725,590) of these records are assigned to 59,606 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), which represent OTUs. However, only 94,010 specimen records have been identified to species level, representing 16,425 species (Figure 2). This highlights ongoing needs for taxonomic capacity and expertise.\nThis milestone reflects the collaborative efforts of 284 research institutions, demonstrating the commitment of South Africa’s biodiversity research community to building a comprehensive DNA barcode species reference library. Despite this progress, challenges remain, including incomplete geographical coverage, taxonomic gaps, limited taxonomic expertise, and the underutilization of barcode data in conservation and management frameworks15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The BIN system relies on multiple sequences per species that capture intraspecific variation across distributions and to improve phylogenetic resolution7. To maximize its effectiveness, future sampling should focus on:\n\nentire species’ ranges, especially for known species that have not yet been barcode\nsparsely sampled areas, including biodiversity hotpots and threatened ecosystems\nunderstudied taxonomic groups, ensuring priority taxa are adequately represented\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Proportional representation of taxon groups with BINs in each South African province. Taxon group ‘Fungi’ is excluded because it had no BIN records on BOLD. Category “Other Animals” are species that do not fit into the outlined taxon groups. Category “Other Organisms” are organisms other than animal, plant or fungi (e.g., Protista). Numbers indicate the number of BINs. Map adapted from Mahlatse et al. under review.\n\n\n\nCurrently, a significant number of South African records on BOLD remain private while researchers analyse them (Figure 4). While understandable, this can create redundancies and slow the growth of the publicly accessible reference library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Number of South African records on BOLD broken down by public (published) and private (unpublished) records. Graph adapted from Mahlatse et al. under review.\n\n\n\nTo address these challenges, it is recommended that DNA barcoding efforts be coordinated and collaborative, ensuring national resources are used efficiently and research gaps are strategically targeted. Establishing a directory of existing barcoding projects and project leaders, alongside regular SABOL-led community meetings and conferences, will strengthen communication and collaboration among institutions.",
